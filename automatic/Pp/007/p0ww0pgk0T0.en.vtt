00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
little bit more peaceful as for the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.660 
little bit more peaceful as for the
office<00:03:12.810> part<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.410> room<00:03:13.650> decided<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.519> bring

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
in this desk with legs as you see

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.780 
in this desk with legs as you see
there's<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> lot<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.519> bulk<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.239> here

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
there's not a lot of bulk in here

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.660 
there's not a lot of bulk in here
the<00:03:19.090> reason<00:03:19.569> being<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.980> kind<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.310> Airy

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
the reason being this kind of Airy

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.399 
the reason being this kind of Airy
feeling<00:03:22.150> into<00:03:22.390> here<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:22.720> gives<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.079> illusion

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
feeling into here it gives the illusion

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.289 
feeling into here it gives the illusion
that<00:03:23.620> there<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.010> some<00:03:24.310> more<00:03:24.459> space<00:03:24.819> in<00:03:25.150> this

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
that there is some more space in this

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.119 
that there is some more space in this
room<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:25.750> we'd<00:03:25.900> done<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.140> big<00:03:26.379> old<00:03:26.530> clunky<00:03:26.920> desk

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
room if we'd done a big old clunky desk

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.350 
room if we'd done a big old clunky desk
it<00:03:27.310> would<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.519> eaten<00:03:27.760> too<00:03:27.790> much<00:03:28.060> space

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
it would have eaten too much space

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.170 
it would have eaten too much space
visually<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.860> also<00:03:30.040> decided<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.670> put<00:03:30.760> up<00:03:31.030> these

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
visually we also decided to put up these

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.059 
visually we also decided to put up these
cabinets<00:03:31.840> these<00:03:32.019> are<00:03:32.140> expedite<00:03:32.620> cabinets

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
cabinets these are expedite cabinets

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.160 
cabinets these are expedite cabinets
what<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.700> like<00:03:33.879> about<00:03:34.030> these<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.659> we<00:03:34.780> move<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
what I like about these is we move the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.050 
what I like about these is we move the
line<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> storage<00:03:35.860> off<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.459> ground<00:03:36.760> so

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
line of the storage off the ground so

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.220 
line of the storage off the ground so
we've<00:03:37.180> got<00:03:37.360> plenty<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.690> room<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.840> walk<00:03:38.049> around

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
we've got plenty of room to walk around

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.250 
we've got plenty of room to walk around
and<00:03:38.829> we<00:03:38.950> put<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.280> up<00:03:39.459> here<00:03:39.819> on<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.239> wall<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.780> like

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
and we put it up here on the wall I like

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.199 
and we put it up here on the wall I like
the<00:03:41.409> frosted<00:03:41.920> glass<00:03:41.950> windows<00:03:42.760> because

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
the frosted glass windows because

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.970 
the frosted glass windows because
another<00:03:43.659> way<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.170> can<00:03:44.379> add<00:03:44.620> space

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
another way that you can add space

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.979 
another way that you can add space
visually<00:03:45.579> is<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.819> use<00:03:45.970> glass<00:03:46.329> but<00:03:46.599> we<00:03:46.690> like<00:03:46.870> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
visually is to use glass but we like the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.690 
visually is to use glass but we like the
frosted<00:03:47.500> glass<00:03:47.530> because<00:03:48.159> that<00:03:48.340> way<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.549> can

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
frosted glass because that way you can

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.220 
frosted glass because that way you can
throw<00:03:48.909> all<00:03:49.060> your<00:03:49.209> junk<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.629> here<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.019> when<00:03:50.109> you

throw all your junk in here and when you

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.660 
throw all your junk in here and when you
close<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.769> can't<00:03:51.010> really<00:03:51.220> see<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.640> so

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
close it you can't really see it so

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.940 
close it you can't really see it so
these<00:03:51.940> work<00:03:52.180> out<00:03:52.359> really<00:03:52.629> well<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:53.470> far<00:03:53.530> as<00:03:53.739> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
these work out really well as far as the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.640 
these work out really well as far as the
guest<00:03:54.250> room<00:03:54.609> part<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.390> room<00:03:55.569> we<00:03:56.440> brought

really pull off this kind of eclectic
exotic<00:05:25.289> look<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.919> like<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.430> way<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.699> turns<00:05:26.910> out

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
exotic look I like the way it turns out

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.360 
exotic look I like the way it turns out
we<00:05:27.300> had<00:05:27.419> a<00:05:27.449> lot<00:05:27.630> of<00:05:27.780> indecision<00:05:28.590> going<00:05:29.070> on<00:05:29.220> we

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
we had a lot of indecision going on we

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.890 
we had a lot of indecision going on we
had<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> little<00:05:29.669> back-and-forth<00:05:30.240> which<00:05:30.720> was

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
had a little back-and-forth which was

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.330 
had a little back-and-forth which was
fine<00:05:31.139> but<00:05:31.289> I<00:05:31.380> think<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.650> end<00:05:31.770> results<00:05:32.160> pretty

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
fine but I think the end results pretty

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.370 
fine but I think the end results pretty
good<00:05:32.610> but<00:05:33.330> more<00:05:33.449> importantly<00:05:33.870> we<00:05:34.139> want<00:05:34.289> to
