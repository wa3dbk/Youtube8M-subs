a long time we know each other really
well<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> think<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.420> friend<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
well so I think to be friend it's one of

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.679 
well so I think to be friend it's one of
it's<00:00:24.510> very<00:00:24.750> important<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.470> us<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:27.330> more

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it's very important for us and it's more

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.210 
it's very important for us and it's more
easy<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> court<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
easy when you are in the court and you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
easy when you are in the court and you
have<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.519> talk<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.849> someone<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.599> know

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
have to talk with someone they know

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.319 
have to talk with someone they know
really<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> say<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> say

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
really what to say they know how to say

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:43.250 
really what to say they know how to say
so<00:00:34.670> that's<00:00:35.670> why<00:00:35.850> maybe<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:42.260> every

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so that's why maybe we are here every

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.549 
so that's why maybe we are here every
day<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:46.789> yes<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.930> tough<00:00:49.230> match<00:00:49.530> we

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
day and yes it will be a tough match we

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.689 
day and yes it will be a tough match we
are<00:00:50.899> good<00:00:51.899> ranking<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> results<00:00:53.340> we

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
are good ranking with the results we

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.439 
are good ranking with the results we
played<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> time<00:00:55.730> but<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.300> not

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
played a lot of time but I think is not

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.590 
played a lot of time but I think is not
just<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> won<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> big<00:00:58.620> match<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.600> think

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
just that won the big match I think

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
just that won the big match I think
there<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.680> others<00:01:02.129> big<00:01:02.430> match<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.210> will

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
there are others big match and you will

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.730 
there are others big match and you will
see<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.899> can't<00:01:04.589> tell<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:07.619> very

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
see I can't tell you but it's very

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.719 
see I can't tell you but it's very
simple<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.180> go<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:10.619> check<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
simple to see if you go to to check the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
simple to see if you go to to check the
match<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.360> against<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
match one against the other one so I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.789 
match one against the other one so I
think<00:01:14.790> she<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.560> more

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
think she is and they are much more

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
think she is and they are much more
important<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.369> me<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> time<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.869> it's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
important than me this time I think it's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
important than me this time I think it's
gonna<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.799> tough<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.159> both<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.759> us<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.340 
was very nice all the week was very very
nice<00:01:48.320> for<00:01:49.320> me<00:01:49.610> because<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:52.500> play<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.770> Italy

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.190 

family<00:01:56.350> fans<00:01:56.890> fans<00:01:58.289> anything<00:01:59.729> yeah<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.990> big

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
family fans fans anything yeah it's big

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.319 
family fans fans anything yeah it's big
pressure<00:02:02.560> but<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.829> always<00:02:06.369> something

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
pressure but it's always something

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.040 
pressure but it's always something
special<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.990> play<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.360> country<00:02:10.599> where

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
special to play in in the country where

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.360 
special to play in in the country where
you<00:02:11.099> born

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
you born

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.420 
you born
when<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.670> grow<00:02:13.000> up<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.810> think<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.920> time<00:02:15.160> to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
when you grow up I think it's time to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.330 
when you grow up I think it's time to
maybe<00:02:16.360> come<00:02:16.780> back<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.140> Italy<00:02:17.290> next<00:02:17.769> match<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
maybe come back in Italy next match and

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.570 
maybe come back in Italy next match and
give<00:02:19.269> some<00:02:20.430> satisfaction<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.430> in

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
give some satisfaction I think it's in

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.640 
give some satisfaction I think it's in
Italy<00:02:24.760> really<00:02:25.330> tough<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.870> play<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.349> it's<00:02:26.500> true

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
Italy really tough to play but it's true

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.559 
Italy really tough to play but it's true
also<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.190> really<00:02:27.280> nice<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.030> pressure<00:02:28.299> is

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
also it's really nice the pressure is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.089 
also it's really nice the pressure is
really<00:02:28.870> high<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.400> know<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:32.560> always<00:02:32.860> play

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
really high but you know we always play

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.180 
really high but you know we always play
really<00:02:33.280> good<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.790> Italy<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.680> better<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
really good in Italy so it's better to
