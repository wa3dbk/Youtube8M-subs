for this game lately just been hankering
for<00:00:32.520> jonesing<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.239> fun<00:00:33.480> bag<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.140> say

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
for jonesing for a fun bag as they say

for jonesing for a fun bag as they say
ok<00:00:35.309> they<00:00:35.430> don't<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.730> say<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> don't

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270

repeat<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:36.899> parents<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.260> ask<00:00:37.440> what

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
repeat that to your parents or ask what

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.930 
repeat that to your parents or ask what
that<00:00:37.649> means<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.309> very<00:00:38.460> bad<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that means that would be very bad and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.250 
that means that would be very bad and
you<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.270> probably<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.690> watch<00:00:39.840> me<00:00:40.079> ever

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you would probably not watch me ever

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.549 
you would probably not watch me ever
again<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:41.190> um<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.809> yeah<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.320> been

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
again but um but yeah I just been

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
again but um but yeah I just been
hankering<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
hankering for it and it's kind of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639 
hankering for it and it's kind of
surprising<00:00:45.239> seeing<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
surprising seeing as how you know I

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
surprising seeing as how you know I
think<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> biggest<00:00:47.370> factor<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.120> people<00:00:48.390> had

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
think the biggest factor that people had

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.470 
think the biggest factor that people had
against<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.850> BS<00:00:50.850> factor<00:00:51.270> when

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
against this game was the BS factor when

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
against this game was the BS factor when
it<00:00:51.510> comes<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.960> new<00:00:52.079> tubes<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> explosions<00:00:52.980> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it comes to new tubes and explosions in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
it comes to new tubes and explosions in
general<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> halo<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:54.780> have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
general and halo you don't really have

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.389 
general and halo you don't really have
that<00:00:54.960> too<00:00:55.260> much<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.590> mean<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.980> nuclear

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that too much I mean you have nuclear

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.740 
that too much I mean you have nuclear
rockets<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> course<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.329> there's<00:00:57.510> only<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
rockets of course but there's only one

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.389 
rockets of course but there's only one
of<00:00:58.050> them<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> map<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:58.739> given<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
of them on a map at any given time and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.220 
of them on a map at any given time and
there<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> noob<00:00:59.820> too<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.170> very

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there is a noob too but it is not very

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.349 
there is a noob too but it is not very
powerful<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.489> does<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.180> some

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
powerful and it does actually take some

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
powerful and it does actually take some
skill<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.690> use<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.890> not

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
skill to use into time then it's not

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.530 
skill to use into time then it's not
just<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.369> shooting<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> general<00:01:06.060> area<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
just like shooting the general area and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.789 
just like shooting the general area and
a<00:01:06.570> bunch<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> people<00:01:06.869> died<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.439> he<00:01:07.560> didn't

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a bunch of people died like he didn't

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.270 
a bunch of people died like he didn't
send<00:01:07.950> modern<00:01:08.189> warfare<00:01:08.369> 2<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.860> definitely

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
bugged me at all um and i think the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.399 
bugged me at all um and i think the
biggest<00:01:27.360> reason<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.170> i've<00:01:28.320> been

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
biggest reason for that is i've been

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.530 
biggest reason for that is i've been
watching<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:29.070> videos<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.490> black<00:01:29.939> ops<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
watching some videos on black ops and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
watching some videos on black ops and
from<00:01:31.229> what<00:01:31.350> I've<00:01:31.470> seen<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.280> noob<00:01:32.460> tube<00:01:32.670> has

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
from what I've seen the noob tube has

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.630 
from what I've seen the noob tube has
been<00:01:32.909> nerfed<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.689> toned<00:01:34.020> down<00:01:34.640> excessively

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
been nerfed or toned down excessively

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
been nerfed or toned down excessively
which<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> big<00:01:36.570> fan<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.229> i've<00:01:37.409> been<00:01:37.619> i've

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
which I'm a big fan of so i've been i've

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
which I'm a big fan of so i've been i've
been<00:01:37.920> watching<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.850> kill<00:01:39.090> radius<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
been watching it and the kill radius is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
been watching it and the kill radius is
much<00:01:39.840> less<00:01:40.079> than<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> used<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.220> i

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
much less than it used to be and i

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
much less than it used to be and i
believe<00:01:41.549> i<00:01:41.640> saw<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.060> video<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> guy<00:01:42.689> had

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
believe i saw one video where a guy had

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
believe i saw one video where a guy had
on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> perk<00:01:43.590> flak<00:01:43.950> jacket<00:01:44.460> which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
on the perk flak jacket which is the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.690 
on the perk flak jacket which is the
equivalent<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.990> blast<00:01:46.320> shield<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
equivalent of a blast shield but it's a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.999 
equivalent of a blast shield but it's a
perk<00:01:47.880> instead<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.329> an<00:01:48.450> equipment<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.380> he<00:01:49.799> took

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
perk instead of an equipment but he took

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
perk instead of an equipment but he took
a<00:01:50.130> noob<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.520> bike<00:01:50.700> straight<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> chest<00:01:51.630> or

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a noob to bike straight to the chest or

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
a noob to bike straight to the chest or
exploded<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> wall<00:01:53.040> directly<00:01:53.640> behind

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
exploded like on a wall directly behind

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580 
exploded like on a wall directly behind
him<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.329> less<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.659> two<00:01:54.840> inches<00:01:54.990> away<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
him like less than two inches away and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
him like less than two inches away and
he<00:01:55.740> survived<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> noob<00:01:57.210> tube<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.540> been

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
he survived so if the noob tube has been

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
he survived so if the noob tube has been
tone<00:01:57.899> down<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.170> much<00:01:58.500> i<00:01:58.829> am<00:01:58.890> i<00:01:59.280> am<00:01:59.430> ok<00:01:59.790> with<00:01:59.820> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
being in the game it actually might take

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
being in the game it actually might take
some<00:02:02.430> semblance<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.030> skill<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.659> what

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.119 
the kimball umps with a silencer
silencer<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.410> i<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> play

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
silencer because i really like to play

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I can't really play too aggressive as

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
I can't really play too aggressive as
the<00:02:14.819> range<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.420> any<00:02:16.140> akimbo<00:02:16.440> weapon<00:02:16.830> pretty

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the range in any akimbo weapon pretty

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.309 
the range in any akimbo weapon pretty
much<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.610> awful<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.720> mean<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.080> can't

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
much is just awful I mean you can't

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.050 
much is just awful I mean you can't
shoot<00:02:19.590> farther<00:02:19.920> than<00:02:20.160> 15<00:02:20.550> feet<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.910> hope<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
shoot farther than 15 feet and hope to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.089 
shoot farther than 15 feet and hope to
get<00:02:21.269> even<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.540> hitmarker<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.230> chance<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:23.069> a

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
get even a hitmarker a chance at a

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.369 
get even a hitmarker a chance at a
hitmarker<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.269> really<00:02:24.870> had<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.019> mix<00:02:25.230> things

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
hitmarker so I really had to mix things

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.110 
hitmarker so I really had to mix things
up<00:02:25.590> mix<00:02:25.860> my<00:02:26.010> gameplay<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.459> because<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.700> normally

matter at all and after a while I could

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.620 
matter at all and after a while I could
care<00:04:43.200> less<00:04:43.230> if<00:04:43.590> we<00:04:43.740> won<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.330> don't<00:04:45.510> know

care less if we won and I don't know
it's<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:47.100> how<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.280> game<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.730> and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
it's just this is how the game is and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.580 
it's just this is how the game is and
you<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.420> think<00:04:48.750> video<00:04:48.990> games<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.470> the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
you know you think video games like the

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.190 
you know you think video games like the
point<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.920> to<00:04:50.070> win<00:04:50.220> overall<00:04:50.550> but<00:04:51.450> on<00:04:51.900> call<00:04:52.140> of

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
point is to win overall but on call of

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.050 
point is to win overall but on call of
duty<00:04:52.440> for<00:04:52.590> some<00:04:52.740> reason<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.340> don't<00:04:53.850> know<00:04:54.030> I

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
duty for some reason I don't know I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.160 
duty for some reason I don't know I
don't<00:04:54.210> know<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.480> it's<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.750> game<00:04:54.990> in

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
don't know if it's just the game in

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.810 
don't know if it's just the game in
general<00:04:55.350> this<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.010> way<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.250> Activision

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
general this is the way that Activision

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.550 
general this is the way that Activision
made<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.210> but<00:04:57.450> when<00:04:57.720> he<00:04:57.810> really<00:04:58.110> doesn't<00:04:58.440> seem

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
made it but when he really doesn't seem

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.350 
made it but when he really doesn't seem
to<00:04:58.680> matter<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.280> that's<00:04:59.790> probably<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.330> part

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
to matter and I that's probably in part

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.510 
to matter and I that's probably in part
to<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:01.200> fact<00:05:01.230> that<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.740> can<00:05:01.920> join<00:05:02.190> in

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
to the fact that you can join in

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.850 
to the fact that you can join in
progress<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.630> then<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.110> can<00:05:04.230> also<00:05:04.350> leave<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
progress and then you can also leave the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.770 
progress and then you can also leave the
game<00:05:05.010> without<00:05:05.190> penalty<00:05:05.760> so<00:05:05.940> maybe<00:05:06.150> something

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
game without penalty so maybe something

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.360 
game without penalty so maybe something
along<00:05:07.050> those<00:05:07.200> lines<00:05:07.350> being<00:05:07.710> changed<00:05:08.070> up<00:05:08.220> would

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
along those lines being changed up would

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.160 
along those lines being changed up would
change<00:05:08.610> that<00:05:08.820> but<00:05:09.000> yeah<00:05:09.420> that's<00:05:09.510> it<00:05:09.840> for<00:05:10.080> this

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
change that but yeah that's it for this

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.900 
change that but yeah that's it for this
game<00:05:10.320> guys<00:05:10.560> final<00:05:10.890> scores<00:05:11.100> 14<00:05:11.460> kills<00:05:11.670> one
