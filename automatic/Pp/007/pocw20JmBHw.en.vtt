removed the spark plug and put a thin

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
removed the spark plug and put a thin
metal<00:00:35.460> rod<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.350> resting<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.360> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
metal rod in here that is resting on the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.250 
metal rod in here that is resting on the
top<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> piston<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> bike<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
top of the piston so with the bike in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
top of the piston so with the bike in
sixth<00:00:46.260> gear<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.399> rotate<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.969> rear<00:00:48.180> wheel

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
sixth gear I can rotate the rear wheel

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.950 
sixth gear I can rotate the rear wheel
and<00:00:49.309> cause<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.760> piston<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> go<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.809> down

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and cause the piston to go up and down

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.240 
and cause the piston to go up and down
when<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.520> its<00:00:53.760> highest<00:00:54.390> point<00:00:56.899> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
when this is at its highest point the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.990 
when this is at its highest point the
bike<00:00:59.250> will<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.699> at<00:01:00.440> top<00:01:01.440> dead<00:01:01.949> center<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
bike will be at top dead center so that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.980 
bike will be at top dead center so that
we<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.539> check<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.769> valves<00:01:08.060> okay<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.689> push

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we can check the valves okay so I push

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
we can check the valves okay so I push
this<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.520> feel

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this all the way down so that I can feel

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
this all the way down so that I can feel
the<00:01:11.880> top<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> piston<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.799> begin

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the top of the piston and I begin

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
the top of the piston and I begin
rotating<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.180> rear<00:01:15.390> wheel<00:01:15.659> forward<00:01:18.530> actually

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
rotating the rear wheel forward actually

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.609 
rotating the rear wheel forward actually
it<00:01:19.799> went<00:01:20.040> down<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:21.229> that<00:01:22.229> sodas

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it went down right there that sodas

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
it went down right there that sodas
falling<00:01:23.040> away<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> keep<00:01:25.110> rotating<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
falling away so I keep rotating and here

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.160 
falling away so I keep rotating and here
we<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.659> mmm

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.300 

ah

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:56.410 

I<00:01:42.399> can<00:01:42.880> feel<00:01:43.149> it<00:01:43.299> going<00:01:43.600> up<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.200 

right<00:01:57.080> there<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:59.870> top<00:02:00.110> dead<00:02:00.350> center<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.210> I'm

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
right there that top dead center so I'm

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.370 
right there that top dead center so I'm
going<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.450> install<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.050> valve<00:02:05.110> cover<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.229> guess

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to install the valve cover I guess

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.050 
going to install the valve cover I guess
and<00:02:06.860> all<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> bolts<00:02:07.700> are<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.259> at

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and all of the bolts are going to be at

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.420 
and all of the bolts are going to be at
63<00:02:11.060> inch<00:02:11.600> pounds<00:02:12.290> with<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> exception<00:02:13.250> of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
because these hold the water pump body

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.699 
because these hold the water pump body
on<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.090> these<00:02:23.090> two<00:02:23.390> pinch<00:02:23.690> bolts<00:02:24.110> that

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
on and these two pinch bolts that

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.380

when<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.010> removed<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.790> bolts<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.390> I've

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
when I removed the bolts because I've

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.020 
when I removed the bolts because I've
had<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:44.810> bike<00:02:45.260> apart<00:02:45.769> for<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.340> couple<00:02:47.150> weeks<00:02:47.360> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
had this bike apart for a couple weeks I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.130 
had this bike apart for a couple weeks I
made<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.090> replica<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:53.030> valve<00:02:53.450> cover<00:02:54.050> and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
made a replica of the valve cover and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.580 
made a replica of the valve cover and
put<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.830> bolts<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.750> their<00:02:56.750> slot<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.500> know

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
put the bolts in their slot so I know

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.270 
put the bolts in their slot so I know
exactly<00:02:58.130> which<00:02:58.760> bolts<00:02:59.300> go<00:02:59.780> where<00:03:00.019> they're<00:03:00.709> of

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
exactly which bolts go where they're of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.870 
exactly which bolts go where they're of
different<00:03:02.230> lengths<00:03:03.230> as<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.769> see<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.760> it's

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
different lengths as you can see so it's

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.550 
different lengths as you can see so it's
sort<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.150> imperative<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.170> put<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
sort of imperative that you put the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.580 
sort of imperative that you put the
right<00:03:06.739> bolt<00:03:07.100> back<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:09.049> right<00:03:09.940> space<00:03:11.590> it

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
right bolt back in the right space it

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.590 
right bolt back in the right space it
helps<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:12.860> can<00:03:13.010> draw<00:03:13.579> a<00:03:13.610> little<00:03:13.790> diagram<00:03:14.060> on

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
helps you can draw a little diagram on

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.180 
helps you can draw a little diagram on
this<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.200> remind<00:03:15.650> yourself<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.220> order

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
this to remind yourself the order

whatever<00:03:19.190> little<00:03:19.400> tricks<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> takes<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.329> that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
whatever little tricks it takes so that

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.830 
whatever little tricks it takes so that
you<00:03:20.540> remember<00:03:21.110> exactly<00:03:23.980> where<00:03:24.980> how

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
you remember exactly where how

everything

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
everything

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.220 
everything
goes<00:03:27.870> back<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:29.040> get<00:03:29.390> just<00:03:30.390> kind<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.659> seating

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
goes back to get just kind of seating

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.839 
goes back to get just kind of seating
this<00:03:32.659> just<00:03:33.659> nice<00:03:33.980> use<00:03:34.980> your<00:03:35.159> hand<00:03:35.430> you're<00:03:35.700> less

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
this just nice use your hand you're less

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.170 
this just nice use your hand you're less
likely<00:03:35.879> to<00:03:37.189> over<00:03:39.439> torque<00:03:40.790> another<00:03:41.790> good<00:03:41.939> trick

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
likely to over torque another good trick

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.880 
likely to over torque another good trick
is<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.329> always<00:03:42.510> use<00:03:42.810> quarter<00:03:43.500> inch<00:03:43.620> drive

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
is to always use quarter inch drive

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.210 
is to always use quarter inch drive
whenever<00:03:44.190> possible<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:47.099> stops<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.640> from<00:03:49.220> over

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
whenever possible it stops you from over

whenever possible it stops you from over
tiny<00:03:50.780> also<00:03:51.780> using<00:03:52.110> your<00:03:52.230> left<00:03:52.470> hand<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:53.250> a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
tiny also using your left hand it's a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.440 
tiny also using your left hand it's a
safety<00:03:53.609> measure<00:03:55.670> I'm<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:56.909> pick<00:03:57.329> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
safety measure I'm going to pick the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.000 
safety measure I'm going to pick the
lower<00:03:57.720> value<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.430> 40<00:04:00.500> torque<00:04:01.500> all<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.890> them

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
lower value like 40 torque all of them

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.229 
lower value like 40 torque all of them
and<00:04:02.209> then<00:04:03.379> go<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.440> 63<00:04:05.220> from<00:04:05.400> there<00:04:07.909> so<00:04:08.909> we're

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
and then go to 63 from there so we're

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.080 
and then go to 63 from there so we're
ready<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.690> adjust<00:04:10.139> to<00:04:11.099> check<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.609> adjust<00:04:11.670> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
ready to adjust to check and adjust the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.879 
ready to adjust to check and adjust the
valves<00:04:13.370> 0.002<00:04:14.370> inch<00:04:14.909> or<00:04:15.329> 0.05<00:04:16.079> millimeter

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
valves 0.002 inch or 0.05 millimeter

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.680 
valves 0.002 inch or 0.05 millimeter
feeler<00:04:17.340> gauge<00:04:17.810> between<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:20.340> adjuster<00:04:21.150> and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.409 

where<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.900> adjuster<00:04:25.380> actually<00:04:26.300> contacts<00:04:27.300> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
where the adjuster actually contacts the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.680 
where the adjuster actually contacts the
valve

valve

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.610

so<00:04:30.870> this

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.400

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.040 

little<00:07:20.759> anal<00:07:21.759> retentive<00:07:22.150> about<00:07:22.479> this<00:07:22.720> but<00:07:22.960> it

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
little anal retentive about this but it

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.810 
little anal retentive about this but it
takes<00:07:23.259> so<00:07:23.470> much<00:07:23.530> time<00:07:23.860> to<00:07:24.039> get<00:07:24.129> to<00:07:24.190> this<00:07:24.370> point

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
takes so much time to get to this point

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:33.639 
takes so much time to get to this point
you<00:07:26.150> really<00:07:26.600> want<00:07:26.780> to<00:07:26.810> make<00:07:26.900> sure<00:07:26.960> this<00:07:27.350> is

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:33.649 

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:35.319 

it's<00:07:34.039> almost<00:07:34.159> best<00:07:34.489> to<00:07:34.609> go<00:07:34.699> a<00:07:34.729> little<00:07:34.969> bit<00:07:35.059> too

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:35.329 
it's almost best to go a little bit too

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:43.539 
it's almost best to go a little bit too
tight<00:07:37.089> and<00:07:38.089> then<00:07:38.299> back<00:07:38.629> it<00:07:39.019> off<00:07:41.109> and<00:07:42.219> once<00:07:43.219> we

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:43.549 
tight and then back it off and once we

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:46.419 
tight and then back it off and once we
have<00:07:43.849> the<00:07:44.239> proper<00:07:44.839> adjustment<00:07:45.589> it's<00:07:45.949> just<00:07:46.279> a

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:46.429 
have the proper adjustment it's just a

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:50.909 
have the proper adjustment it's just a
matter<00:07:46.639> of<00:07:47.529> torquing<00:07:48.529> the<00:07:48.889> lock<00:07:49.699> nuts<00:07:50.119> and

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 
matter of torquing the lock nuts and

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:53.409 
matter of torquing the lock nuts and
double-checking<00:07:51.919> because<00:07:52.069> it<00:07:52.399> does<00:07:52.579> change

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:53.419 
double-checking because it does change

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:57.339 
double-checking because it does change
slightly<00:07:54.109> and<00:07:54.969> the<00:07:55.969> once<00:07:56.749> everything<00:07:57.109> is<00:07:57.199> all

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.349 
slightly and the once everything is all

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:00.849 
slightly and the once everything is all
torqued<00:07:57.739> down<00:07:57.909> but<00:07:59.289> when<00:08:00.289> we<00:08:00.469> have<00:08:00.619> it<00:08:00.739> ready

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:00.859 
torqued down but when we have it ready

00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:05.619 
torqued down but when we have it ready
we<00:08:01.789> are<00:08:02.179> good<00:08:02.689> to<00:08:03.439> go
