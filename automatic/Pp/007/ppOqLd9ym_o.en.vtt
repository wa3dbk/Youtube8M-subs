00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.360
 the macaws in a genus of birds of the family of parrots there are 23 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.750
 species of which 6 are extinct are of American origin the inhabitants 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.640
 Financial from Mexico to the Northeast of Argentina 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.369
 in Mexico it is common to find the green macaw or also known 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.590
 like huaca maya mexicana its species that lives in our country this in the area 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.589
 by the way is that 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.619
 centered in the arctic 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.660
 what you wish 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.800
 e the southern part of our country 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.200
 are not important animals for our arrival ecosystem will be in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.020
 extinction danger are normal protected 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.200
 within well rules for example 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.090
 the 0 59 people ave 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.780
 the norm that protects all this type of animals not to mammalian birds reptiles 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.420
 many of these birds are in captivity to take care of themselves and thus avoid 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.020
 that they reach their extinction 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 thanks to the assisted reproduction work that is done here in the park 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.050
 morelos 6 of the ten Mayan quotas they have been born in captivity 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.270
 assisted reproduction because it would be this mind 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 wait for the animal to sling 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.780
 in the games of this case d 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.619
 the female the poignant of we rush per cent 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.200
 then once the public female 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.040
 our the mud the mets in the incubator there we start with arrests 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.120
 have attended 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.320
 here we drive at 12 m and assisted because we leave the offspring until the parents 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.910
 percent since basically they start to get them out of the nest so they 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 be ready as their wings 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.580
 with these birds, environmental enrichment work is also done in the classrooms 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.640
 they have what it takes to move from one point to another 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.770
 It is also enrichment work to nilmar are trained to be birds 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.070
 more docile so they can live with humans 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.050
 the work must be done before they enter as they are in feathers 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.320
 we already take it out of sound you will start to handle retamozo 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.069
 we remark eating 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.069
 and with the syringe give them feeding by feeding 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.389
 until they are tender after being more dates 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.659
 and later already since if they are a little more the one that is handled with the 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.249
 peanut inns vs with me is going to make change electron 4 on the other hand the 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.559
 order for 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.659
 be treats from one side to the other 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
