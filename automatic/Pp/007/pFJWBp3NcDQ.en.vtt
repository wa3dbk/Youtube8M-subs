here<00:01:38.570> on<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.810> score<00:01:39.020> they're<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.500> well

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
here on the score they're going to well

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.560 
here on the score they're going to well
they<00:01:39.860> do<00:01:39.920> have<00:01:40.040> one<00:01:40.190> lap<00:01:40.550> down<00:01:40.580> so<00:01:41.090> we're

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
they do have one lap down so we're

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.790 
they do have one lap down so we're

came<00:02:05.119> by<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.390> monitor<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.289> looks<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.830> there

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
came by the monitor it looks like there

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.540
