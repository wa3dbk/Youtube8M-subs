00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.840 
cool place and I want to get some cool
pictures<00:01:04.869> of<00:01:04.899> it<00:01:05.199> so<00:01:05.440> this<00:01:06.250> has<00:01:06.399> already<00:01:06.550> been

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
pictures of it so this has already been

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.529 
pictures of it so this has already been
this<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.539> a<00:01:07.770> believing<00:01:08.940> combination<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:10.060> three

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
this is a believing combination of three

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.150 
this is a believing combination of three
images<00:01:11.459> minus<00:01:12.459> one<00:01:12.759> plus<00:01:13.030> one<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:14.160> neutral

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
images minus one plus one and a neutral

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.690 
images minus one plus one and a neutral
exposure<00:01:16.679> so<00:01:17.679> that's<00:01:17.950> already<00:01:18.160> but<00:01:18.399> done<00:01:18.580> at

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
exposure so that's already but done at

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.029 
exposure so that's already but done at
this<00:01:18.819> point<00:01:19.030> but<00:01:19.360> for<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.869> effect<00:01:20.830> that

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
this point but for the effect that

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.410 
this point but for the effect that
brings<00:01:21.280> out<00:01:21.429> detail<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.580> are<00:01:24.610> going<00:01:25.149> to

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
brings out detail we are going to

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.460 
brings out detail we are going to
duplicate<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.410> layer<00:01:26.440> once<00:01:28.050> okay<00:01:29.050> so<00:01:29.110> we're

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
duplicate the layer once okay so we're

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.050 
duplicate the layer once okay so we're
gonna<00:01:29.560> right<00:01:29.830> click<00:01:29.860> on<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.429> layer<00:01:30.580> one<00:01:30.910> that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
gonna right click on the layer one that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.639 
gonna right click on the layer one that
we<00:01:31.149> just<00:01:31.390> duplicated<00:01:31.929> from<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.140> background

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
we just duplicated from the background

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.870 
we just duplicated from the background
we're<00:01:33.520> gonna<00:01:33.670> hit<00:01:33.910> duplicate<00:01:34.630> layer<00:01:34.959> and<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
we're gonna hit duplicate layer and this

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.839 
we're gonna hit duplicate layer and this
dialogue<00:01:37.270> box<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.599> gonna<00:01:37.690> pop<00:01:37.959> up<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:39.009> you

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
dialogue box is gonna pop up and you

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.609 
dialogue box is gonna pop up and you
don't<00:01:39.970> want<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:40.450> hit<00:01:40.539> OK<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:40.929> duplicate

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
don't want to just hit OK and duplicate

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.650 
don't want to just hit OK and duplicate
in<00:01:41.709> the<00:01:41.770> same<00:01:41.950> file<00:01:42.280> for<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.149> effect<00:01:43.539> we

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
in the same file for this effect we

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.690 
in the same file for this effect we
actually<00:01:43.959> have<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.200> take<00:01:44.349> it<00:01:44.530> into<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.890> separate

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
actually have to take it into a separate

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.389 
actually have to take it into a separate
file<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.990> then<00:01:47.289> we're<00:01:47.470> gonna<00:01:47.590> bring<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.099> back

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
file that then we're gonna bring it back

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.960 
file that then we're gonna bring it back
so<00:01:49.679> we<00:01:50.679> want<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.069> hit<00:01:51.250> new<00:01:51.750> press<00:01:52.750> ok<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.970> as

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
so we want to hit new press ok and as

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.910 
so we want to hit new press ok and as
you<00:01:55.119> can<00:01:55.209> see<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.539> created<00:01:55.810> another<00:01:56.080> untitled

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
you can see it created another untitled

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.120 
you can see it created another untitled
document<00:01:57.209> that's<00:01:58.209> our<00:01:58.390> original<00:01:58.899> this<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.560> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
document that's our original this is the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.260 
document that's our original this is the
one<00:02:00.369> we<00:02:00.459> just<00:02:00.489> duplicated<00:02:01.119> ok<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:03.250> before<00:02:03.940> we

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
one we just duplicated ok now before we

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.550 
one we just duplicated ok now before we
do<00:02:04.390> anything<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.989> need<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.440> change<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:07.560> bits

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
do anything we need to change the bits

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.999 
do anything we need to change the bits
channel<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
channel of the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.760 
channel of the
image<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.849> can't<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> effect<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.230> 16-bit

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
image we can't do the effect in 16-bit

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
image we can't do the effect in 16-bit
because<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.129> do<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> 16-bit<00:02:15.170> most

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
because if we do in the 16-bit most

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.949 
because if we do in the 16-bit most
people's<00:02:16.530> computers<00:02:16.980> cannot<00:02:17.700> handle<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
people's computers cannot handle the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.110 
people's computers cannot handle the
amount<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.280> effect<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.760> we're<00:02:20.879> going<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
amount of the effect that we're going to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.500 
amount of the effect that we're going to
do<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.800> need<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.069> change<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.610> 8-bit<00:02:26.510> okay

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
do so we need to change it to 8-bit okay

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.850 
do so we need to change it to 8-bit okay
now<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.810> need<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.170> duplicate<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.800> layer

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
now we need to duplicate this layer

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.270 
now we need to duplicate this layer
again<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:31.019> ctrl<00:02:31.769> J<00:02:32.040> command<00:02:32.069> J<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.880> Mac<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
again so ctrl J command J on a Mac and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
again so ctrl J command J on a Mac and
then<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.760> want<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.150> invert<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.959> layer<00:02:37.319> which

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
then we want to invert this layer which

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.150 
then we want to invert this layer which
is<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.819> control<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.470> or<00:02:40.470> command<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.099> on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
is going to be control I or command I on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.420 
is going to be control I or command I on
a<00:02:41.430> Mac<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.349> at<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.470> moment<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
a Mac and at the moment this is going to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.860 
a Mac and at the moment this is going to
look<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.610> strange<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.540> make<00:02:45.690> much

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
look really strange and not make much

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.839 
look really strange and not make much
sense<00:02:46.049> but<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.440> stick<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:46.980> me<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.220> you'll

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
sense but just stick with me and you'll

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.330 
sense but just stick with me and you'll
see<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.269> I'm<00:02:48.390> gonna<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:50.190> right

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
see what I'm gonna do with it all right

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.500 
see what I'm gonna do with it all right
go<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.910> image<00:02:52.310> adjustments<00:02:53.510> brightness

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
go up to image adjustments brightness

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.190 
go up to image adjustments brightness
and<00:02:54.660> contrast<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:56.390> we<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> reduce<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
and contrast and we want to reduce the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.550 
and contrast and we want to reduce the
contrast<00:02:58.560> all<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.069> way<00:02:59.660> press<00:03:00.660> okay<00:03:03.319> okay<00:03:04.319> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
contrast all the way press okay okay and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.280 
contrast all the way press okay okay and
so<00:03:05.069> now<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.489> we've<00:03:05.610> done<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.819> we<00:03:06.390> want<00:03:07.110> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so now that we've done that we want to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.670 
so now that we've done that we want to
make<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.010> blending<00:03:08.819> mode<00:03:09.140> vivid<00:03:10.140> light<00:03:10.349> and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
make the blending mode vivid light and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680 
make the blending mode vivid light and
now<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.579> going<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> look<00:03:11.880> really<00:03:11.940> strange

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
now it's going to look really strange

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.479 
now it's going to look really strange
and<00:03:12.989> you're<00:03:13.049> gonna<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.440> depending<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
and you're gonna see depending on the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.789 
and you're gonna see depending on the
picture<00:03:14.819> some<00:03:15.480> very<00:03:15.660> strange<00:03:15.959> pixels<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.739> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
picture some very strange pixels and the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.920 
picture some very strange pixels and the
dark<00:03:17.040> spots<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:18.030> that's<00:03:18.389> fine<00:03:18.630> at<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
dark spots but that's that's fine at the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.629 
dark spots but that's that's fine at the
moment<00:03:19.370> okay<00:03:20.750> next<00:03:21.750> step<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.410> go<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.010> filter

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
moment okay next step is go to filter

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:31.819 
moment okay next step is go to filter
and<00:03:25.220> blur<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:27.359> surface<00:03:28.019> blur<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:31.590> can

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
and blur and surface blur and you can

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.949 
and blur and surface blur and you can
change<00:03:32.160> these<00:03:32.340> settings<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:33.030> me<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.780> is

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
change these settings for me this is

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.720 
change these settings for me this is
what<00:03:34.139> I've<00:03:34.230> always<00:03:34.380> discovered<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.250> work<00:03:35.519> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
what I've always discovered to work the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.569 
what I've always discovered to work the
best<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.500> I've<00:03:37.500> never<00:03:37.799> changed<00:03:38.040> them<00:03:38.310> since

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
best and I've never changed them since

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.780 
best and I've never changed them since
figuring<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.239> but<00:03:39.600> my<00:03:40.560> radius<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.100> 88<00:03:41.549> and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
figuring it out but my radius is 88 and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.360 
figuring it out but my radius is 88 and
third<00:03:42.120> shot<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.450> 12<00:03:42.859> so<00:03:43.859> I'm<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.100> gonna<00:03:44.190> head

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
third shot is 12 so I'm just gonna head

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.839 
third shot is 12 so I'm just gonna head
and<00:03:44.519> press<00:03:44.609> okay

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.040 

and<00:03:48.849> so<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.390> gonna<00:03:49.540> take<00:03:49.629> a<00:03:49.750> little<00:03:49.930> bit

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
and so this is gonna take a little bit

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.720 
and so this is gonna take a little bit
of<00:03:50.110> time<00:03:50.260> even<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.650> an<00:03:50.769> 8-bit<00:03:51.069> image<00:03:51.340> if<00:03:51.489> this

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
of time even on an 8-bit image if this

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.050 
of time even on an 8-bit image if this
was<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> 16-bit<00:03:52.599> this<00:03:53.319> takes<00:03:53.709> like<00:03:53.980> 30<00:03:54.760> minutes

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
was a 16-bit this takes like 30 minutes

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.410 
was a 16-bit this takes like 30 minutes
to<00:03:55.300> an<00:03:55.390> hour<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.750> complete<00:03:57.090> okay<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.150> now<00:03:58.390> that

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
to an hour to complete okay so now that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.850 
to an hour to complete okay so now that
that's<00:03:58.660> done<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.080> kind<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.349> looks<00:03:59.560> like<00:03:59.680> a

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
that's done it kind of looks like a

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.640 
that's done it kind of looks like a
severely<00:04:00.519> overdone<00:04:01.090> high<00:04:01.360> pass<00:04:01.690> except

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
severely overdone high pass except

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.190 
severely overdone high pass except
without<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.010> haloing<00:04:03.700> effects<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:05.080> we're

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
without the haloing effects but we're

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.020 
without the haloing effects but we're
not<00:04:05.349> done<00:04:05.590> yet<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:06.250> still<00:04:06.519> have<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.819> do<00:04:07.000> a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
not done yet we still have to do a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.960 
not done yet we still have to do a
little<00:04:07.299> bit<00:04:07.510> more<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:08.019> this<00:04:08.170> layer<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:09.519> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
little bit more to this layer so the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.490 
little bit more to this layer so the
next<00:04:10.209> thing<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.480> want<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.720> do<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.049> you<00:04:11.200> want<00:04:11.410> to

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
next thing you want to do is you want to

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.640 
next thing you want to do is you want to
merge<00:04:12.220> everything<00:04:12.489> down<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.569> create<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.470> new

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
merge everything down and create a new

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.949 
merge everything down and create a new
layer<00:04:14.890> with<00:04:15.129> it<00:04:15.280> all<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.630> want<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.870> do

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
layer with it all so you want to do

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.640 
layer with it all so you want to do
shift<00:04:20.410> control<00:04:21.130> alt<00:04:21.459> e'<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.479> that<00:04:23.320> merges

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
shift control alt e' and that merges

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.680 
shift control alt e' and that merges
everything<00:04:24.010> creates<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.430> new<00:04:24.580> layer<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:27.690> then

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
everything creates a new layer and then

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.890 
everything creates a new layer and then
we<00:04:29.110> are<00:04:29.350> going<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:30.070> desaturate<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.630> layer

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
we are going to desaturate this layer

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.430 
we are going to desaturate this layer
now<00:04:31.930> we<00:04:33.000> don't<00:04:34.000> want<00:04:34.210> any<00:04:34.419> contamination<00:04:35.260> from

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
now we don't want any contamination from

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.310 
now we don't want any contamination from
the<00:04:35.500> colors<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:35.979> are<00:04:36.100> left<00:04:36.280> over<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:37.320> then

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
the colors that are left over and then

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.450 
the colors that are left over and then
we're<00:04:38.560> gonna<00:04:38.650> go<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.950> filter<00:04:39.700> blur<00:04:41.460> Gaussian

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
we're gonna go to filter blur Gaussian

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.120 
we're gonna go to filter blur Gaussian
blur<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.150> we're<00:04:44.080> going<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.320> just<00:04:44.440> blur<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.979> by

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
blur and we're going to just blur it by

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.189 
blur and we're going to just blur it by
one<00:04:45.310> pixel<00:04:45.639> so<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.300> we<00:04:46.389> can<00:04:46.570> get<00:04:46.720> rid<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.900> some

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
one pixel so that we can get rid of some

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.370 
one pixel so that we can get rid of some
of<00:04:47.229> those<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:48.400> harsh<00:04:48.669> edges<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.960> may<00:04:50.229> have

preference<00:05:37.630> but<00:05:38.520> at<00:05:39.520> this<00:05:39.760> point<00:05:40.090> this<00:05:40.419> is

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
preference but at this point this is

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.100 
preference but at this point this is
done<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.220> this<00:05:42.550> is<00:05:42.610> how<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:42.970> effect<00:05:43.630> works

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
done and this is how the effect works

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.879 
done and this is how the effect works
and<00:05:45.660> really<00:05:46.660> what<00:05:46.930> it<00:05:47.020> does<00:05:47.229> is<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.560> just<00:05:47.740> it

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
and really what it does is it just it

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.909 
and really what it does is it just it
brings<00:05:48.430> like<00:05:48.760> a<00:05:48.789> kind<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.780> local<00:05:49.990> contrast

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
brings like a kind of a local contrast

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.370 
brings like a kind of a local contrast
into<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:51.940> image<00:05:52.180> and<00:05:52.419> kind<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.020> gives<00:05:53.260> a

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
into the image and kind of gives a

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.130 
into the image and kind of gives a
little<00:05:53.500> more<00:05:54.150> detailing<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.780> overall
