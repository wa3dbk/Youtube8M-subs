00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
they've already feel I think they filmed

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.630 
they've already feel I think they filmed
because<00:01:11.930> he<00:01:12.290> kind<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.620> disappeared<00:01:13.190> for<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.430> few

because he kind of disappeared for a few

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.520 
because he kind of disappeared for a few
months<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.870> must<00:01:15.050> have<00:01:15.080> been<00:01:15.230> filmed

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530
