00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.630
 hi friends and friends today we are going to talk 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.910
 about good corn pollen many 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.980
 Sometimes people think that medicines 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.769
 you have to buy them in pharmacies but 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.289
 it's not really that complicated if you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.800
 they fix here near here is like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 some small little bags or like 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.710
 small honeycomb yellow landmarks in the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 corn is in fact the male flower of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.130
 corn and that contains many substances 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.650
 very important for our health and 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.200
 then only one thing is missing 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.710
 just pass both fingers like this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.690
 envelope on the flower until it falls on 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.540
 these little yellow bags 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.470
 those are the little ones 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:05.300
 and we connect them inside a vessel 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.810
 for example we can use the vessel 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.020
 in this way a vessel that is used 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.540
 for the sauces we can put them there and 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.060
 store in the refrigerator 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.580
 well we already connect a little pollen 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.680
 of corn look that's the result of 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 collection of three maizes in reality this 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.980
 with the corn days is to keep enough 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.860
 pollen to have it for anything 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.400
 who are there now what is it for? 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.760
 the power of the good country have been made 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.930
 very important studies on how the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.720
 corn pollen detoxifies the liver and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.610
 how the industry is behaving 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.380
 food that is currently 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.410
 putting in many many additives 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.450
 many flavoring dyes 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.400
 clarifying thickeners all 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.810
 additives that you can imagine 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.850
 I can practically say that today there is no 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.440
 a single meal that does not have any 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.070
 trace of an agrochemical or a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.600
 chemical additive and then all those 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.090
 all these substances that are not 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.800
 conducive to health end in the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.990
 liver recharges in the liver then 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.540
 now we can say that practically a 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.760
 80 percent of the population has its 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.790
 liver let's say overloaded with toxic 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.910
 because of the pollutants either 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.460
 environmental issues of making food either in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.460
 the furniture that surrounds us is why 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.650
 very important to seek remedies that we 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.920
 help cleanse the liver 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.590
 and the second use that pollen has 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.770
 corn and this was known since the times 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.130
 prehispanic 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.410
 that prevents and cures prostatitis the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.120
 inflammation of the prostate and has 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.950
 important vitamin content 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.680
 the pollen the corn pollen contains 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.760
 carotene that is pro vitamin to vitamin

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.760
 Corn pollen can also help 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.819
 hypertensive to prone people 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.340
 to bleeding varices and almorranas 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.510
 etcetera also has many compounds 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.660
 very interesting as histidine 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.970
 isoleucine leucine marine lysine quinine

 sixtina has been british united mind 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.760
 arginine in short this is a whole 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:52.909
 of substances secondary metabolites 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.299
 vitamins and probiotic substances 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.300
 it means that they help us maintain 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.620
 our health 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.620
 we talk about the person
