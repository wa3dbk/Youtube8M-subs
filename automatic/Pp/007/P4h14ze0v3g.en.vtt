00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
alright let's see how we can fly and

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:11.720 
alright let's see how we can fly and
land<00:00:02.429> this

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.180

I'm<00:00:38.310> working<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.120> slow<00:00:39.420> flight

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
I'm working on here at slow flight

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.350 
I'm working on here at slow flight
I<00:00:40.890> wanna<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.400> how<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.970> plane<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
I wanna see how I can get the plane to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.150 
I wanna see how I can get the plane to
fly<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:43.020> slow

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
fly really slow

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:55.850 
fly really slow
I've<00:00:45.670> got<00:00:45.970> it<00:00:46.120> fairly<00:00:46.600> heavy

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.180 

you

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.500 

to<00:01:06.190> be<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.340> bad<00:01:06.490> as<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.640> channel<00:01:06.880> as<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.150> can<00:01:07.300> land

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
to be a bad as a channel as I can land

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.660 
to be a bad as a channel as I can land
it<00:01:07.690> it's<00:01:08.470> lighted<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:09.010> one<00:01:09.190> controlled

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
it it's lighted on one controlled

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.040 
it it's lighted on one controlled
surface<00:01:09.760> there<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.480> might<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.780> been<00:01:10.810> why

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
surface there that might have been why

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:21.460 
surface there that might have been why
it<00:01:11.110> was<00:01:11.370> acting<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.400> little<00:01:12.520> goofy

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.490 

so<00:01:22.010> it<00:01:22.280> does<00:01:22.430> not<00:01:22.460> like<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.850> fly<00:01:23.210> flow

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.100 

that's<00:01:28.500> about<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.039> gliders<00:01:29.399> got<00:01:30.110> all

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that's about all the gliders got all

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:49.420 
that's about all the gliders got all
right<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.979> again

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.920 

with<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.550> power<00:01:50.760> off<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> flies<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.690> pair

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
with the power off it flies like a pair

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:23.360 
with the power off it flies like a pair
of<00:01:51.990> scissors

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.630 

whoa<00:02:25.620> never<00:02:26.620> done<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.920> before<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.310> lost<00:02:27.520> the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
whoa never done that before I lost the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:37.750 
whoa never done that before I lost the
battery

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:59.380 

you

well<00:03:00.390> that's<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.690> bear<00:03:00.840> what<00:03:01.020> i<00:03:01.050> do<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:01.410> i<00:03:01.530> try

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
well that's a bear what i do when i try

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.490 
well that's a bear what i do when i try
to<00:03:01.740> divide<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.490> for<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> landing<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:04.380> have

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
to divide it in for a landing just have

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.370 
to divide it in for a landing just have
to<00:03:04.650> stitch<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.310> let<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.490> fall<00:03:05.730> over

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
to stitch it up and let it fall over

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.360 
to stitch it up and let it fall over
take<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> up<00:03:07.590> high<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.069> see<00:03:08.220> how<00:03:08.250> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
take it up high and just see how it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:25.750 
take it up high and just see how it
glides<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:08.970> no<00:03:09.150> no<00:03:09.900> power<00:03:10.110> at<00:03:10.380> all

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.090

it<00:04:45.250> up<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.520> they'll<00:04:45.669> try<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:45.880> land<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.180> with

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
it up and they'll try to land it with

00:04:46.270 --> 00:05:01.290 
it up and they'll try to land it with
some<00:04:46.389> power<00:04:47.190> let's<00:04:48.190> do<00:04:48.430> it

could<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.580> even<00:05:17.640> see<00:05:17.880> it<00:05:17.940> behind<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.240> car<00:05:18.420> now

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
could you even see it behind the car now

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.430 
could you even see it behind the car now

beginner's out there an idea of how this

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.510 
beginner's out there an idea of how this
plane<00:05:24.900> flies<00:05:25.140> it's<00:05:25.710> actually<00:05:25.890> a<00:05:26.100> very<00:05:26.220> stable

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
plane flies it's actually a very stable

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.390 
plane flies it's actually a very stable

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
plane but compared to the wild hawk it's

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.240 
plane but compared to the wild hawk it's
a<00:05:29.550> serious<00:05:29.730> handful<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.510> have<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.440> do<00:05:31.800> quite<00:05:32.190> a

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
a serious handful I have to do quite a

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.620 
a serious handful I have to do quite a
bit<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.550> adjusting<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.210> knowing<00:05:33.540> exactly

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
bit of adjusting of knowing exactly

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.330 
bit of adjusting of knowing exactly
where<00:05:34.110> I<00:05:34.140> want<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.410> set<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.710> pitch<00:05:34.980> or<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
where I want to set the pitch or the

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.730 
where I want to set the pitch or the
role<00:05:35.670> so<00:05:36.450> that<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:36.810> don't<00:05:36.870> end<00:05:37.170> up<00:05:37.350> losing

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
role so that I don't end up losing

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.340 
role so that I don't end up losing
control<00:05:38.010> of<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.340> flame<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.990> even<00:05:39.990> with<00:05:40.170> that

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
control of the flame and even with that

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.630 
control of the flame and even with that
when<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.560> get<00:05:40.740> close<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.160> ground<00:05:41.250> sometimes

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
when I get close to the ground sometimes

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.540 
when I get close to the ground sometimes
it<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.990> loses<00:05:43.530> altitude<00:05:43.680> faster<00:05:44.340> than<00:05:44.490> i

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
it it loses altitude faster than i

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.320 
it it loses altitude faster than i
expected<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:46.130> so<00:05:47.130> if<00:05:47.490> you're<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:47.880> first-time

something<00:05:51.750> of<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:51.870> lines<00:05:52.260> fly<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.250> heck<00:05:53.490> out

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
something of that lines fly the heck out

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.540 
something of that lines fly the heck out
of<00:05:53.700> that<00:05:53.940> crash<00:05:54.540> that<00:05:54.780> a<00:05:54.810> bunch<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.110> times<00:05:55.550> when

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
of that crash that a bunch of times when

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.160 
of that crash that a bunch of times when
you<00:05:56.670> really<00:05:56.700> can't<00:05:57.210> get<00:05:57.510> any<00:05:57.750> more<00:05:57.990> out<00:05:58.050> of

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
you really can't get any more out of

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.270 
you really can't get any more out of
that<00:05:58.380> plane<00:05:58.590> then<00:05:58.800> go<00:05:58.890> ahead<00:05:58.980> and<00:05:59.070> build

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
that plane then go ahead and build

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.770 
that plane then go ahead and build
something<00:05:59.550> like<00:05:59.670> this<00:05:59.820> these<00:06:00.450> planes<00:06:00.690> are

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
something like this these planes are

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.080 
something like this these planes are
great<00:06:00.990> this<00:06:01.590> is<00:06:01.770> four<00:06:02.190> dollars<00:06:02.220> worth<00:06:02.730> of<00:06:02.820> foam

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
great this is four dollars worth of foam

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.080 
great this is four dollars worth of foam
from<00:06:03.390> lowes<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:04.350> it's<00:06:04.770> very<00:06:05.370> very<00:06:05.490> affordable

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
from lowes so it's very very affordable

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.540 
from lowes so it's very very affordable
I<00:06:06.300> like<00:06:07.080> it<00:06:07.200> it's<00:06:07.860> a<00:06:07.920> good<00:06:08.070> time<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:08.340> want<00:06:08.490> to

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
I like it it's a good time I want to

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.180 
I like it it's a good time I want to
build<00:06:08.700> more<00:06:08.820> of<00:06:08.940> these<00:06:09.260> Marcy<00:06:10.260> powers<00:06:10.530> compds

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
build more of these Marcy powers compds

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.440 
build more of these Marcy powers compds
good<00:06:12.180> times<00:06:12.420> see<00:06:13.230> you<00:06:13.290> later
