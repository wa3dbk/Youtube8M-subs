 Because it has been changed to 1 stable , write on the right side of the sticker and the box etc. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.930

 It is a golden point here in Blanc or this box, and it is completely flat esb cable storage and 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:04:02.010
 In a nutshell , it seems to be open with this usb cable car. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.730
 It is an event day It is about the length of the wish of a cable child or something really familiar ordinary cutter

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.910
 But Well in this 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.529

 Here later dating It is the video just a Lou-ray Disc 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.020
 Although I read it with the feeling that the playback function is not installed if I look closely 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.690
 That's soft 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.290
 I want to do a little experiment to say that you can see it using Mac Blu-ray player 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.130
 Do you think 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.630
 I wish or not put since this was written I do not support If you did not look to recruit temporary 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.100
 Qasr and the other one 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:20.550
 You may buy a drive For now, save the recorded video etc. 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.550
