00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.719
 welcome to the video tutorial 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.289
 The Samsung High Resolution Monitors 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.240
 We will look at example of the sd 850 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 monitor see what the special of the high 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 Resolution monitors is an answer 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.439
 Among other things lends quad hd with white 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.869
 quad hd you have a resolution of 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.430
 2560 x 1440 at one screen 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.800
 ratio of 16 to 9 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 So we have four times as many pixels 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 as with the 720p hd video standard and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 if your customers have videos or photos 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 If you want to watch then you have 4 times 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.960
 so many pixels and so many professionals 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 like to work alone but sometimes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 also work with other professionals in the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.149
 team together and that is what we have 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 samsung also taken as a model and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.750
 have the device accordingly ergonomic 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 adapted you have one here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.730
 height adjustment you also have one 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.619
 angle adjustability and you can do that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.150
 device also in ev mode use that is 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 just then interesting when I go to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.140
 example text documents hair like me 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.220
 then want to look at the whole area 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.869
 I do not go up and down 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.229
 scroll and so I can still 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 more efficient and effective at sd 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.250
 850 monitors have a very high 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 viewing angle with a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 viewing angle stability of 178 degrees 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 both horizontally and vertically we have 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.549
 always the best condition for 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 ergonomic working 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.430
 Another highlight is the picture 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.229
 in picture functionality 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.759
 the picture in picture functionality 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.079
 offers the advantage that I am one 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.570
 window can turn one 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.689
 this can be from a second source 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.869
 a tv tuner another pc or to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.280
 example, another audio video source 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.990
 But this also has an advantage for the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 work because if I mean with mine 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 Colleagues, for example, in a project 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 then i can work on my 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 project continue to work and I see that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.980
 my colleagues have already progressed 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.530
 have in 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.580
 small window but it can be synonymous 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.070
 sometimes that will be me a bit 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.080
 longer alone in the office seats and at the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.670
 project work and favorite show 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.530
 Of course I can do it myself 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.390
 can also leave the Show 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.590
 work and still missed nothing 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 from my favorite show 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.070
 that's the picture in picture 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.810
 functionality with the picture in 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.760
 picture functionality you have the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.130
 advantage that they have two digital 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 Connections have on the display s.den man 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.820
 two computers can connect 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.740
 that has the advantage when I work on 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.360
 I can use the two different systems 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.900
 at the same time to the monitor 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.730
 to let 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.910
 with the picture at picture button 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.140
 I activate this mode and then 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.160
 we also have our second picture immediately 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.220
 a special feature that I still too 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.690
 to highlight is the color space 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.030
 normal lcd monitors usually have 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.420
 16 7 million colors representing you 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.600
 can 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.600
 have the weko hd displays from samsung 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.880
 the advantage that we have 10 7 billion 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.310
 can show colors and we can 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.230
 also the srgb color space to 100 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.200
 percent represent the ideal device 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.480
 for professionals, of course, there is in our 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.770
 country many monitors in different 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.790
 inch sizes and different 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.440
 award categories 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.150
 have a look at the samsung 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.890
 portfolio 2015 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.410
 You will surely be for your customers 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.850
 the right product will be successful 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.850
