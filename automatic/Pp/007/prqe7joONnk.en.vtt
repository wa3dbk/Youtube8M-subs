00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.370 
heavy which is especially impressive you
in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> fat<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> middle<00:01:56.369> sort<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> mid<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.030> low

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
in the fat the middle sort of mid to low

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.469 
in the fat the middle sort of mid to low
so<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> similar<00:01:58.770> shape<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.610> course<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so it's a similar shape of course to the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
so it's a similar shape of course to the
power<00:02:00.719> blaster<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.439> fact<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.860> bats

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
power blaster and in fact the other bats

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.480 
power blaster and in fact the other bats
in<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> ton<00:02:02.670> range<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.649> mid<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
in the ton range you do get that mid to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.419 
in the ton range you do get that mid to
low<00:02:05.640> sweets<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> also<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.869> very

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
low sweets but you also get very

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.889 
low sweets but you also get very
exaggerated<00:02:08.429> bow<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.090> might<00:02:09.239> see<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.690> there

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
exaggerated bow you might see that there

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.710 
exaggerated bow you might see that there
it's<00:02:10.020> once<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> good<00:02:10.319> banana<00:02:10.649> that's<00:02:11.250> certain

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
it's once a good banana that's certain

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.840 
it's once a good banana that's certain
the<00:02:11.870> pickup<00:02:12.290> obviously<00:02:13.160> play<00:02:13.340> over<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> top

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the pickup obviously play over the top

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.150 
the pickup obviously play over the top
as<00:02:14.030> well<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.240> look<00:02:14.390> at<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.110> see<00:02:15.980> it's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
as well I look at that and see it's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.710 
as well I look at that and see it's
quite<00:02:16.340> an<00:02:16.400> Indian<00:02:16.730> trait<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.150> course<00:02:17.360> more

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
yeah yeah like I said very good value

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.530 
yeah yeah like I said very good value
for<00:02:34.250> money<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.700> was<00:02:34.880> especially<00:02:35.180> impressed

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
for money I was especially impressed

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
for money I was especially impressed
with<00:02:35.720> performance<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.560> these<00:02:36.740> bats<00:02:37.010> they're

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
with performance on these bats they're

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.630 
with performance on these bats they're
very<00:02:37.460> softly<00:02:37.820> pressed<00:02:38.240> very<00:02:39.110> responsive<00:02:39.950> I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
very softly pressed very responsive I

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.910 
very softly pressed very responsive I
think<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.600> kind<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.020> bats<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.500> will<00:02:42.620> perform

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
think the kind of bats that will perform

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.400 
think the kind of bats that will perform
very<00:02:43.220> well<00:02:43.370> earlier<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.120> their<00:02:44.240> life<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:45.260> not

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
very well earlier in their life and not

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.770 
very well earlier in their life and not
take<00:02:45.650> too<00:02:45.800> long<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:46.910> going<00:02:46.970> how<00:02:47.510> clean

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
take too long to get going how clean

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.090 
take too long to get going how clean
that<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.410> well<00:02:48.590> I've<00:02:48.709> straightened

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
that one is as well I've straightened

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.620 
that one is as well I've straightened
even<00:02:49.400> those<00:02:49.550> grains<00:02:49.880> are<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.360> they're<00:02:50.510> not

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
even those grains are that they're not

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.420 
even those grains are that they're not
the<00:02:50.720> greatest<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:51.380> course<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.980> said<00:02:52.010> great

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the greatest of course like I said great

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.610 
the greatest of course like I said great
grade<00:02:52.850> three<00:02:53.240> most<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.170> these<00:02:54.260> only<00:02:54.440> have

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
grade three most of these only have

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.210 
grade three most of these only have
about<00:02:54.709> six<00:02:55.100> or<00:02:55.250> seven<00:02:55.550> grains<00:02:55.880> um<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.950> yeah

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
about six or seven grains um so yeah

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.310 
about six or seven grains um so yeah
they're<00:02:58.400> not<00:02:58.760> exactly<00:02:59.390> lookers<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.200> they

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
they're not exactly lookers but they

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.310 
they're not exactly lookers but they
still<00:03:00.560> look<00:03:00.770> nice<00:03:01.040> for<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.490> grade<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.760> think

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
still look nice for the grade I think

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.170 
still look nice for the grade I think
and<00:03:03.320> more<00:03:03.680> importantly<00:03:04.220> like<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.730> said<00:03:04.970> they<00:03:05.120> do

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and more importantly like I said they do

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.060 
and more importantly like I said they do
really<00:03:05.510> perform<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.350> that's<00:03:06.560> why<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.800> think

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
really perform and that's why I think

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.230 
really perform and that's why I think
they're<00:03:07.220> great<00:03:07.340> value<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:07.910> money

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240
