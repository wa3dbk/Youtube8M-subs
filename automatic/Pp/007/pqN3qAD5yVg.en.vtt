00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.439 

so<00:00:01.890> today<00:00:02.310> I'm<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.700> create<00:00:03.000> this

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so today I'm going to create this

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.740 
so today I'm going to create this
chain-linked<00:00:04.290> animation<00:00:04.890> which<00:00:05.130> someone

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
chain-linked animation which someone

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.360 
chain-linked animation which someone
requested<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:07.859> gonna<00:00:07.980> start<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.340> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
requested so I'm just gonna start with a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.669 
requested so I'm just gonna start with a
fresh<00:00:08.639> scene<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:10.139> quickest<00:00:10.500> way<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
fresh scene and the quickest way to

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.009 
fresh scene and the quickest way to
create<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> chain<00:00:11.580> link<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.360> create<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
create a chain link is to create a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.710 
create a chain link is to create a
rectangle<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.960> choose<00:00:15.960> rounding<00:00:17.570> just<00:00:18.570> gonna

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
rectangle and choose rounding just gonna

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.990 
rectangle and choose rounding just gonna
increase<00:00:19.020> surrounding<00:00:19.529> slightly<00:00:20.000> increase

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
increase surrounding slightly increase

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.849 
increase surrounding slightly increase
the<00:00:21.150> width<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.350> we've<00:00:22.949> got<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> piece<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
the width so we've got a piece like that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
the width so we've got a piece like that
I'm<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.449> spline<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.689> choose<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
I'm going to go to spline and choose a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.080 
I'm going to go to spline and choose a
circle<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
circle this is going to be a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.840 
circle this is going to be a
cross-section<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:32.369> then<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
cross-section and then I'm going to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.389 
cross-section and then I'm going to
create<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.480> sweep<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> put

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
create a sweep and I'm just going to put

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.250 
create a sweep and I'm just going to put
the<00:00:35.550> circle<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.300> rectangle<00:00:36.870> into<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the circle and the rectangle into the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.729 
the circle and the rectangle into the
sweep<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.870> circle<00:00:39.870> needs<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.350> above

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
sweep and the circle needs to be above

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.010 
sweep and the circle needs to be above
the<00:00:40.890> rectangle<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.510> we've<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.899> this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the rectangle and now we've got this

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.670 
the rectangle and now we've got this
chain-link<00:00:43.649> piece<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.200> adjust<00:00:46.200> on

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
chain-link piece which we can adjust on

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
chain-link piece which we can adjust on
the<00:00:46.710> fly<00:00:46.829> which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.910> handy<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.270> that's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the fly which is very handy so that's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
the fly which is very handy so that's
the<00:00:48.840> cross<00:00:49.050> section<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:52.280> front

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the cross section and this is the front

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.979 
the cross section and this is the front
section<00:00:53.960> like<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.309> just<00:00:56.309> around<00:00:56.670> them

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
section like that just around them

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.580 
section like that just around them
something<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.440> gonna

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
something like that so I'm just gonna

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
something like that so I'm just gonna
create<00:01:01.920> you're<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.760> gonna<00:01:02.879> pull<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
create you're just gonna pull this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
create you're just gonna pull this
chain-link<00:01:04.040> like<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> next<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.650> need<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
chain-link like that so next we need a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
chain-link like that so next we need a
piece<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> string<00:01:08.340> well<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.360> literally<00:01:09.780> but

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
piece of string well not literally but

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
piece of string well not literally but
I'm<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> go<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> front<00:01:11.490> view

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I'm just going to go to the front view

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.749 
I'm just going to go to the front view
and<00:01:12.350> I'm<00:01:13.350> gonna<00:01:13.500> create<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> spline<00:01:16.759> something

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and I'm gonna create a spline something

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.840 
and I'm gonna create a spline something
like<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:19.320> maybe

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.969 

soon<00:01:25.510> as<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.750> melt<00:01:26.310> next<00:01:27.310> we<00:01:27.490> need<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.670> corner

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
soon as you melt next we need a corner

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.859 
soon as you melt next we need a corner
so<00:01:29.979> I'm<00:01:30.280> just<00:01:30.460> gonna<00:01:30.610> put<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.600> chain-link

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
so I'm just gonna put the chain-link

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.170 
so I'm just gonna put the chain-link
piece<00:01:32.350> into<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.740> corner<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.369> that<00:01:33.400> go<00:01:34.119> to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
piece into the corner like that go to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.200 
piece into the corner like that go to
corner<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.720> set<00:01:34.900> it<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:36.240> object<00:01:37.240> mode<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.970> drag

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
corner I set it to object mode and drag

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.279 
corner I set it to object mode and drag
and<00:01:40.390> drop<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.659> spline<00:01:41.020> half<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:42.690> there<00:01:46.289> we

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
and drop the spline half in there we

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.170 
and drop the spline half in there we
need<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.440> rotate<00:01:47.710> these<00:01:48.130> chain-link<00:01:48.729> pieces

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
need to rotate these chain-link pieces

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.710 
need to rotate these chain-link pieces
so<00:01:49.539> I'm<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.750> gonna<00:01:49.869> go<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.170> transform<00:01:50.799> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
so I'm just gonna go to transform and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.539 
so I'm just gonna go to transform and
that<00:01:52.720> looks<00:01:52.899> about<00:01:53.020> right<00:01:53.350> 90<00:01:53.890> degrees<00:01:54.159> along

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
that looks about right 90 degrees along

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.109 
that looks about right 90 degrees along
heading<00:01:55.830> maybe<00:01:56.830> 90<00:01:57.280> degrees<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:57.759> way<00:01:58.000> as

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
heading maybe 90 degrees this way as

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
heading maybe 90 degrees this way as
well

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
well

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.219 
well
now<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.580> spacing<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.179> between<00:02:01.210> each<00:02:01.750> chain

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
now the spacing in between each chain

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.200 
now the spacing in between each chain
link<00:02:02.470> piece<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.979> kind<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.429> uneven<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:04.119> I'm

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
link piece is a kind of uneven so I'm

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.510 
link piece is a kind of uneven so I'm
going<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.420> go<00:02:04.509> back<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.720> corner<00:02:05.399> where<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.429> says

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
going to go back to corner where it says

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.270 
going to go back to corner where it says
distribution<00:02:07.390> I'm<00:02:07.659> going<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.899> set<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.200> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
distribution I'm going to set this to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.330 
distribution I'm going to set this to
even<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.660> we've<00:02:11.140> got<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.319> nice<00:02:11.560> kind<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.980> equal

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
even now we've got a nice kind of equal

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.600 
even now we've got a nice kind of equal
distance<00:02:12.519> going<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.330> between<00:02:13.989> each<00:02:14.170> piece

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
distance going on in between each piece

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
distance going on in between each piece
I'm<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:15.760> going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.940> increase<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.299> count

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
I'm just going to increase the count

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.240 
I'm just going to increase the count
slightly<00:02:18.150> that's<00:02:19.150> pretty<00:02:19.420> cool<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.890> final

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
slightly that's pretty cool the final

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.180 
slightly that's pretty cool the final
step<00:02:21.519> is<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.880> basically<00:02:22.239> need<00:02:22.540> each<00:02:22.810> piece

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
step is I basically need each piece

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.809 
step is I basically need each piece
rotating<00:02:24.190> in<00:02:24.540> 90<00:02:25.540> degree<00:02:25.840> increments<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.700> they

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
rotating in 90 degree increments so they

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.030 
rotating in 90 degree increments so they
don't<00:02:28.030> basically<00:02:28.500> intersect<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.769> manner

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
don't basically intersect in this manner

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.150 
don't basically intersect in this manner
I<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.820> them<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:30.970> kind<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.590> not<00:02:32.590> touch<00:02:32.890> each

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
I want them to kind of not touch each

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.460 
I want them to kind of not touch each
other<00:02:33.459> basically

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
other basically

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.400 
other basically
but<00:02:35.730> intersect<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.049> chain

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
but intersect and the kind of chain

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.220 
but intersect and the kind of chain
sense<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.760> I'm<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.060> gonna<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> corner

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
sense so I'm just gonna go to the corner

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.770 
sense so I'm just gonna go to the corner
and<00:02:41.380> choose<00:02:41.799> effector<00:02:42.459> more<00:02:43.060> graphic<00:02:43.600> there

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
and choose effector more graphic there

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.410 
and choose effector more graphic there
step<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:48.040> don't<00:02:48.340> need<00:02:48.670> scale<00:02:49.120> on

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
step like that and I don't need scale on

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.479 
step like that and I don't need scale on
the<00:02:49.690> step<00:02:49.930> effector<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.130> I'm<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
the step effector so I'm just going to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.580 
the step effector so I'm just going to
turn<00:02:51.670> off<00:02:51.820> scale<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.510> parameter<00:02:53.049> I'm

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
turn off scale on the parameter I'm

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.650 
turn off scale on the parameter I'm
going<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.829> choose<00:02:54.010> rotation<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:58.480> not

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
going to choose rotation and it's not

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.979 
going to choose rotation and it's not
the<00:02:58.840> heading<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.940> pitch<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.720> need

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the heading it's the pitch that we need

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.440 
the heading it's the pitch that we need
so<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.739> can<00:03:02.950> see<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:03.549> kind<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:04.000> what<00:03:04.329> we

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
so you can see that's kind of what we

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.610 
so you can see that's kind of what we
want<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> mathematical<00:03:08.410> way<00:03:08.440> to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
want and there is a mathematical way to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.949 
want and there is a mathematical way to
calculate<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.790> angle<00:03:10.299> we<00:03:10.390> need<00:03:10.540> here<00:03:10.810> is

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
calculate the angle we need here is

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.310 
calculate the angle we need here is
basically<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.709> number<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.340> clones<00:03:12.579> at<00:03:12.880> 11<00:03:14.730> x

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
basically the number of clones at 11 x

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.670 
basically the number of clones at 11 x
90<00:03:17.320> degrees<00:03:17.620> hit<00:03:18.280> enter<00:03:18.609> so<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.500> accurate

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
90 degrees hit enter so that is accurate

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.880 
90 degrees hit enter so that is accurate
now<00:03:21.640> finally<00:03:22.380> we've<00:03:23.380> got<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.620> little

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
now finally we've got this little

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.940 
now finally we've got this little
problem<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.400> looks<00:03:24.430> like<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:26.319> is<00:03:26.530> still<00:03:26.769> kind

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
problem it looks like this is still kind

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.430 
problem it looks like this is still kind
of<00:03:27.069> too<00:03:28.000> close<00:03:28.329> for<00:03:28.540> comfort<00:03:28.600> it's<00:03:29.170> kind<00:03:29.350> of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
of too close for comfort it's kind of

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.170 
of too close for comfort it's kind of
looks<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.519> might<00:03:30.730> still<00:03:31.030> be

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
looks like it might still be

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.580 
looks like it might still be
intersecting<00:03:31.810> that's<00:03:32.769> because<00:03:33.130> we<00:03:33.280> need<00:03:33.430> to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
intersecting that's because we need to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.059 
intersecting that's because we need to
under<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.580> factor<00:03:36.030> set<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.420> spline<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.769> steps

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
under a factor set the spline the steps

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.400 
under a factor set the spline the steps
flying<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.690> right-click<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.319> go<00:03:40.349> to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
flying you just right-click and go to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.680 
flying you just right-click and go to
supplying<00:03:40.830> presets<00:03:41.310> set<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.090> linear<00:03:42.450> and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
supplying presets set that to linear and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.150 
supplying presets set that to linear and
now<00:03:43.440> we've<00:03:43.650> got<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> much<00:03:44.129> more<00:03:45.560> kind<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.709> even

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
now we've got a much more kind of even

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.930 
now we've got a much more kind of even
distribution<00:03:50.269> rotation<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:53.700> looks

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
distribution rotation and that looks

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.009 
distribution rotation and that looks
like<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.330> gonna<00:03:54.480> work

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
like it's gonna work

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.470 
like it's gonna work
nothing's<00:03:55.440> touching<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:58.290> finally<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.220> need

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
nothing's touching so finally I need

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.729 
nothing's touching so finally I need
something<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.569> attach<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.620> just

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
something to attach this to so I'm just

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.320 
something to attach this to so I'm just
going<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.950> create<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.340> torus<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
going to create the torus it's the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.199 
going to create the torus it's the
quickest<00:04:03.660> object<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.830> create<00:04:04.980> I'm<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.090> going

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
quickest object to create I'm just going

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.690 
quickest object to create I'm just going
to<00:04:06.269> move<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.510> up<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:07.099> gonna<00:04:08.099> slot<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.579> in

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
to move it up just gonna slot it in

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.309 
to move it up just gonna slot it in
actually<00:04:09.030> like<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.540> hopefully<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.140> should

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
actually like that hopefully that should

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.699 
actually like that hopefully that should
be<00:04:10.470> it

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.390 

just<00:04:13.709> make<00:04:13.860> sure<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.130> not<00:04:14.280> touching<00:04:15.200> great

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
just make sure it's not touching great

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.830 
just make sure it's not touching great
and<00:04:17.400> now<00:04:18.470> it's<00:04:19.470> time<00:04:19.680> for<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.979> dynamics<00:04:20.840> so

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
and now it's time for the dynamics so

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.390 
and now it's time for the dynamics so
the<00:04:21.959> torus<00:04:22.320> I'm<00:04:22.470> gonna<00:04:22.650> give<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.979> simulation

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
the torus I'm gonna give it a simulation

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.900 
the torus I'm gonna give it a simulation
tag<00:04:23.760> rigidbody<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.350> set<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.740> static<00:04:26.700> mesh

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
tag rigidbody and set it to static mesh

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.029 
tag rigidbody and set it to static mesh
which<00:04:27.270> means<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:28.530> stays<00:04:29.060> still<00:04:31.039> the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
which means it just stays still the

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.969 
which means it just stays still the
chain-link<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.850> corner<00:04:33.620> I'm<00:04:34.620> gonna<00:04:34.740> give<00:04:34.949> it

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
chain-link the corner I'm gonna give it

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.950 
chain-link the corner I'm gonna give it
a<00:04:35.100> rigidbody<00:04:35.400> but<00:04:36.240> I'm<00:04:36.419> gonna<00:04:36.600> choose

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
a rigidbody but I'm gonna choose

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.400 
a rigidbody but I'm gonna choose
individual<00:04:37.620> elements<00:04:38.190> all<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.810> each<00:04:40.080> piece

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
individual elements all so each piece

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.990 
individual elements all so each piece
kind<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.770> behaves<00:04:42.770> individually<00:04:43.770> each<00:04:44.639> corner

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
kind of behaves individually each corner

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.560 
kind of behaves individually each corner
so<00:04:45.270> I'm<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.229> gonna<00:04:46.350> play<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.620> back<00:04:47.570> boom

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
so I'm just gonna play this back boom

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.430 
so I'm just gonna play this back boom
just<00:04:49.080> explode<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.760> what<00:04:51.030> we<00:04:51.150> need<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.389> do<00:04:51.539> is<00:04:51.690> we

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
just explode so what we need to do is we

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.730 
just explode so what we need to do is we
need<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:53.060> choose<00:04:54.060> moving<00:04:54.630> mesh<00:04:54.900> which<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.590> a

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
need to choose moving mesh which is a

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.520 
need to choose moving mesh which is a
much<00:04:55.979> more<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.990> kind<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.110> better<00:04:58.349> of

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
much more a kind of better of

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.379 
much more a kind of better of
calculation<00:04:59.220> algorithm<00:04:59.729> when<00:04:59.880> it<00:04:59.970> comes<00:05:00.180> to

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
calculation algorithm when it comes to

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.940 
calculation algorithm when it comes to
things<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.780> intersect<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.650> they're<00:05:01.770> quite

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
things that intersect and they're quite

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.839 
things that intersect and they're quite
they're<00:05:02.760> quite<00:05:02.970> complicated<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:04.789> so<00:05:05.789> I'm

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
they're quite complicated and so I'm

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.210 
they're quite complicated and so I'm
just<00:05:05.970> going<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.150> choose<00:05:06.300> moving<00:05:06.660> mesh<00:05:07.099> play<00:05:08.099> it

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
just going to choose moving mesh play it

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.680 
just going to choose moving mesh play it
back<00:05:08.690> hopefully<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.780> should<00:05:09.900> hold<00:05:11.389> it's<00:05:12.389> great

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
back hopefully it should hold it's great

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.469 
back hopefully it should hold it's great
oh<00:05:14.180> we've<00:05:15.180> got<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.330> break<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:16.620> there's<00:05:16.919> a<00:05:16.979> few

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
oh we've got a break so there's a few

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.210 
oh we've got a break so there's a few
factors<00:05:18.479> that<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.870> cause<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.139> break<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.950> how

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
factors that can cause a break and how

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.879 
factors that can cause a break and how
to<00:05:20.280> adjust<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.840> can<00:05:22.410> be<00:05:22.500> tricky

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
to adjust it is a can be tricky

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.920 
to adjust it is a can be tricky
sometimes<00:05:23.180> so<00:05:24.180> I'm<00:05:24.270> just<00:05:24.389> gonna<00:05:24.510> play<00:05:24.720> this

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
sometimes so I'm just gonna play this

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.100 
sometimes so I'm just gonna play this
back<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:26.150> I'm<00:05:27.150> gonna<00:05:27.300> reduce<00:05:27.479> collision

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
back and I'm gonna reduce collision

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.890 
back and I'm gonna reduce collision
noise<00:05:29.240> I'm<00:05:30.240> going<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.479> actually<00:05:30.750> reduce

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
noise I'm going to actually reduce

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.409 
noise I'm going to actually reduce
friction<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:32.599> now<00:05:33.599> it's<00:05:33.780> gonna<00:05:33.960> stay

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
friction and now it's gonna stay

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.030 
friction and now it's gonna stay
see<00:05:36.419> if<00:05:36.510> that<00:05:36.660> makes<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:36.960> difference

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.620 

still<00:05:40.670> got<00:05:40.850> a<00:05:40.880> break<00:05:41.170> now<00:05:42.170> sometimes<00:05:42.890> a

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
still got a break now sometimes a

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.630 
still got a break now sometimes a
choosing<00:05:44.630> custom<00:05:44.840> center<00:05:45.500> can<00:05:46.130> fix<00:05:46.430> things

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
choosing custom center can fix things

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:54.460 
choosing custom center can fix things
for<00:05:47.000> some<00:05:47.150> reason<00:05:52.810> yeah<00:05:53.810> it<00:05:53.930> kind<00:05:54.140> of<00:05:54.200> worked

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
for some reason yeah it kind of worked

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.960 
for some reason yeah it kind of worked
but<00:05:56.560> does<00:05:57.560> cost<00:05:57.920> some<00:05:58.160> kind<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.370> tangling

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
but does cost some kind of tangling

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.750 
but does cost some kind of tangling
sometimes<00:06:00.250> but<00:06:01.250> if<00:06:01.640> that<00:06:01.820> doesn't<00:06:02.180> work<00:06:03.760> you

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
sometimes but if that doesn't work you

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.570 
sometimes but if that doesn't work you
can<00:06:04.790> try<00:06:05.360> fiddling<00:06:06.050> with<00:06:06.170> drag<00:06:06.580> that

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
can try fiddling with drag that

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.040 
can try fiddling with drag that
sometimes<00:06:08.060> helps<00:06:08.420> just<00:06:08.600> adding<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.900> bit<00:06:08.990> of

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
sometimes helps just adding a bit of

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.590 
sometimes helps just adding a bit of
drag<00:06:09.410> it's<00:06:09.620> kind<00:06:09.800> of<00:06:09.830> a<00:06:09.950> cheat<00:06:10.280> for<00:06:13.270> go<00:06:14.270> when

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
drag it's kind of a cheat for go when

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.210 
drag it's kind of a cheat for go when
resistance<00:06:15.200> kind<00:06:15.440> of<00:06:15.500> stops<00:06:15.770> them<00:06:15.980> from

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
resistance kind of stops them from

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.610 
resistance kind of stops them from
falling<00:06:16.970> too<00:06:17.300> hard<00:06:17.570> and<00:06:17.810> therefore<00:06:18.170> breaking

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
falling too hard and therefore breaking

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:51.820 
falling too hard and therefore breaking
so<00:06:19.190> you've<00:06:19.340> got<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.640> option

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:01.250 

there<00:06:52.460> we<00:06:52.580> go

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.040 

and<00:07:01.550> as<00:07:02.550> usual<00:07:03.360> this<00:07:03.600> is<00:07:03.750> running<00:07:04.020> very

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
and as usual this is running very

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.470 
and as usual this is running very
slow-moving<00:07:04.740> mesh<00:07:05.190> is<00:07:05.520> a<00:07:05.550> notoriously<00:07:06.270> slow

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
slow-moving mesh is a notoriously slow

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.330 
slow-moving mesh is a notoriously slow
so<00:07:06.900> you<00:07:07.140> can<00:07:08.130> always<00:07:08.670> bake<00:07:09.000> the<00:07:09.180> cash<00:07:10.340> bake

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
so you can always bake the cash bake

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.690 
so you can always bake the cash bake
hole<00:07:11.580> and<00:07:11.940> then<00:07:12.710> we<00:07:13.710> can<00:07:13.860> watch<00:07:14.010> it<00:07:14.220> back<00:07:14.400> in

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700 
hole and then we can watch it back in

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.610 
hole and then we can watch it back in
real<00:07:14.910> time<00:07:15.240> hopefully<00:07:17.330> there<00:07:18.330> we<00:07:18.480> go<00:07:18.690> much

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
real time hopefully there we go much

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.520 
real time hopefully there we go much
better

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.160 

so<00:07:25.130> that's<00:07:25.430> the<00:07:25.580> end<00:07:25.730> of<00:07:25.850> that<00:07:26.030> quick<00:07:26.390> tutorial

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
so that's the end of that quick tutorial

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.130 
so that's the end of that quick tutorial
and<00:07:27.350> thanks<00:07:27.950> for<00:07:28.040> watching
