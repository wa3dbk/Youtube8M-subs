00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
about the system but if you put them up

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.220

lot more depth to the gameplay and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.830 
lot more depth to the gameplay and
that's<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.450> makes<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> system

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that's really what makes the system

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
that's really what makes the system
shine<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> fact<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
