00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.180
 video and today I'll teach you how to do it 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.490
 campaign of the leÃ´nidas that you both 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.560
 I would ask the first thing you go 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.720
 have to do is load the first 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.340
 registration link and print these 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.860
 leaves you are seeing here now 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.590
 and besides these will come two more that do not 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.290
 Now that are visible only to join a 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.500
 another is ready and we will join here with 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.080
 First crepe tape with small pieces 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.390
 then with large pieces on the f as if 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:49.250
 were a sheet ready just made it go 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.170
 individualize that part that you 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.739
 Come and draw here now, just paste the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 leaves on top of pieces of cardboard with 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.520
 will comply with the plan is not too much 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.580
 thick will not be difficult after 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.899
 steal an ok and you're done 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 these two sheets that you see 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.130
 here are those who have not seen the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:16.159
 little that will serve to make 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.950
 part of the campus christ and now we're going 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.710
 remember every part of the board that you 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.229
 uses a stiletto is easier to use a 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.240
 scissors and of course if you are smaller 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.240
 ask for help with a touch 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.300
 in the end just take the part of the paper 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.250
 the parts containing all the corners of the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.620
 smaller species and may leave 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.510
 with the paper so as not to risk the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.530
 Give yourself up and you'll see it more. 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.020
 forward 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.900
 now just paste it using hot glue here 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.390
 You can use another glue but it will be 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.259
 more complicated since it takes too long 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:02.060
 time the guys just paste pretty easy 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:10.759
 and now let's put the two parts together 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:12.470
 using the pieces of paper here 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.180
 impose enough glue as the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.180
 connection is small ok 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 looks just finish distilled and is already on 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.360
 head 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.760
 Now let's do these lousy things here. 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.120
 to give a final fitting on the up 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.709
 than you do of that I did not take 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.010
 sheet since they are very small and 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.430
 fragile with you have seen now is just for 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.200
 here is a Christian because we 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 Lap is even the end 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.110
 Now just because the side to let me in 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.239
 forgetting between the blades by this 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.269
 The band up here has to have this 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.730
 intention at the time they are going to do it now 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.820
 just paste as the first front door 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.290
 close and economical in school for 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.290
 most amazing track to the end 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.689
 may be adjusting that the inner part 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.920
 already the future of the crest once has a 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.920
 inside hole 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:24.299
 in the end just paste this muscular part 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.209
 this triangle species on the front 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:32.349
 for helping then is to put it 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.689
 social protection of the campus and also 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.690
 I'll have the apple paper part too 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.269
 very fragile with you, now you see 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.940
 joins these two parts using tape 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.069
 crepe temporary judicial system after 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.870
 to take off what I went through can all 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.870
 remove and replace with paste 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.920
 now let's stick our attention as I go 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:59.349
 necklace by nicola on this side 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:02.920
 of the triangle allow to dry 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.760
 today it's just the necklace on the other side 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.019
 done this 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:13.220
 is the building going to be easy going normally 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.810
 you can see now just paste one side 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.810
 and then the other 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.990
 this time there was a mane behind 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.240
 of the helmet when we'll see here is 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.660
 teacher is also left in your case 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.150
 You can shorten the boss later to 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.300
 these two parts can use a 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.280
 paper bit is clear there by 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.280
 inside or else they can use only glue 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:58.070
 Now to finish, just paste this 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:59.570
 part here nothing that was once 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.580
 It's very bad this Wednesday. 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.960
 they can also on the other hand also 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.970
 want to 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:12.080
 ready you are and now you are joining with 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.120
 the ipva with the glue will be of the water and 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.730
 then bought newsjournal is just 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.840
 speculating on the helmet this way 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.790
 quite simple 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.550
 I want to make it clear that not as a cola 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.810
 which dries very fast and ready only 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.060
 we got to the end 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.700
 I'll leave here two links on this side 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.700
 is ready the first ever of the candal 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.410
 made the downhill channel helmet in 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.830
 a channel used in the question of what 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.150
 process protections everything in cardboard 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.490
 come by there that I think it's worth 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.070
 very worth seeing if you liked this 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.810
 design as much as I will not paint a 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.630
 Since I'm here in England, you 're there. 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.110
 some money to get 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.420
 this tutorial is ready and I will not paint 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.480
 I'll leave and maybe another video 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.150
 but if you want to paint and you want to 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.160
 some tips to an idea is provoked 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.230
 game according to a link and will be 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.590
 directed to a video of the wii 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.960
 I feel capable and united ok tulle 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.180
 and I'll find the joinha the favorite 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.550
 enter the channels if they are not the 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.400
 criticism helps a lot in the 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.630
 evaluation of our work. 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.630
 Thank you and see you next time
