and<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.270> more<00:00:48.620> equipment<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.800> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and there is one more equipment that you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.729 
and there is one more equipment that you
can<00:00:50.100> find<00:00:50.430> outside<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.690> couldn't<00:00:52.140> find<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
can find outside but I couldn't find a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.279 
can find outside but I couldn't find a
decent<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.420> tree<00:00:54.750> branch<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
decent one which is a tree branch that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
decent one which is a tree branch that
is<00:00:55.649> thick<00:00:56.070> enough<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> support<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.210> weight

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is thick enough to support your weight

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.569 
is thick enough to support your weight
if<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.530> seen<00:00:58.859> some<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.430> other

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
if you have seen some of my other

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
if you have seen some of my other
outside<00:01:00.449> workout<00:01:01.230> videos<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> probably

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
outside workout videos that you probably

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060 
outside workout videos that you probably
know<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.960> soccer<00:01:04.559> goal

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
know what this is this is a soccer goal

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.880 
know what this is this is a soccer goal
and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.909> find<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.450> useful<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.350> performing

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and I find it very useful for performing

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
and I find it very useful for performing
any<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:09.119> pull-ups<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.780> well<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.170> dips<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
any kind of pull-ups as well as dips and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
any kind of pull-ups as well as dips and
like<00:01:11.220> races<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.320> one

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
like races and this is because this one

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.190 
like races and this is because this one
is<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> very<00:01:14.100> strong<00:01:14.909> object<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.900> have

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
is a very strong object you don't have

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.039 
is a very strong object you don't have
to<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.650> afraid<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> bending<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> bar<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:18.990> even

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
to be afraid of bending the bar or even

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
to be afraid of bending the bar or even
breaking<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> which<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.700> quite

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
breaking it which would be quite

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.390 
breaking it which would be quite
inconvenient<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> probably<00:01:22.500> will<00:01:23.100> have

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
inconvenient as you probably will have

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.149 
inconvenient as you probably will have
to<00:01:23.640> pay<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
to pay for it then and that's not what I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
to pay for it then and that's not what I
want<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> free<00:01:27.540> workout

how<00:01:54.630> much<00:01:54.840> weight<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> use

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
how much weight that you want to use

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.090 
how much weight that you want to use
this<00:01:56.670> means<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.240> some<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> these<00:01:58.259> videos<00:01:58.560> are

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
this means that some of these videos are

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580 
this means that some of these videos are
far<00:01:59.549> from<00:01:59.909> complete<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.439> look

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
far from complete because if I look

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
far from complete because if I look
around<00:02:01.770> me<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.520> will<00:02:02.729> probably<00:02:03.420> find<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:04.020> lot<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
around me I will probably find a lot of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.819 
around me I will probably find a lot of
ways<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.950> perform<00:02:05.399> specific<00:02:06.560> exercises<00:02:07.560> for

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
ways to perform specific exercises for

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.820 
ways to perform specific exercises for
different<00:02:08.729> muscle<00:02:09.119> groups<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.560> what

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
different muscle groups so to see what

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.630 
different muscle groups so to see what
your<00:02:11.099> city<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.580> town<00:02:12.060> has<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
your city or town has to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.340 
your city or town has to
for<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.330> comes<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.780> improvised

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
for you if it comes to improvised

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.010 
for you if it comes to improvised
equipment<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.400> go<00:02:15.700> outside<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:16.990> a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
equipment just go outside and have a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.410 
equipment just go outside and have a
look<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.680> make<00:02:18.040> sure<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.520> everything<00:02:19.150> is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
look and make sure that everything is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.020 
look and make sure that everything is
safe<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.020> also<00:02:20.620> strong<00:02:21.280> enough<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.610> your

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
safe and also strong enough for your

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.059 
safe and also strong enough for your
weight<00:02:22.270> because<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> lot<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.290> kids<00:02:23.590> playing

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
weight because a lot of kids playing

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.430 
weight because a lot of kids playing
grounds<00:02:24.670> should<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:25.120> safe<00:02:25.480> but<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.140> does<00:02:26.410> not

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
grounds should be safe but that does not

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.820 
grounds should be safe but that does not
mean<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.890> they<00:02:27.280> actually<00:02:27.430> are<00:02:27.850> safe<00:02:28.830> you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
mean that they actually are safe you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.400 
mean that they actually are safe you
just<00:02:30.130> saw<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> blooper<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.570> already<00:02:32.050> showed

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
just saw a blooper that I already showed

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.490 
just saw a blooper that I already showed
in<00:02:32.650> first<00:02:33.040> part<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.790> video<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.540> actually

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
in first part of this video and actually

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.560 
in first part of this video and actually
I<00:02:35.530> don't<00:02:35.680> really<00:02:36.100> have<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.550> many<00:02:36.940> bloopers

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
I don't really have that many bloopers

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.470 
I don't really have that many bloopers
from<00:02:38.110> my<00:02:38.410> filming<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.280> usually<00:02:40.060> when<00:02:40.330> I'm

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
from my filming so usually when I'm

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.140 
from my filming so usually when I'm
filming<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.950> make<00:02:42.190> some<00:02:42.430> bloopers<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:43.000> will

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
filming and do make some bloopers I will

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.390 
filming and do make some bloopers I will
put<00:02:43.390> them<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> video<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.890> means<00:02:45.160> that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
put them in the video so this means that

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.300 
put them in the video so this means that
most<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:46.030> my<00:02:46.270> videos<00:02:46.660> are<00:02:47.050> blooper<00:02:47.739> free<00:02:48.100> and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
most of my videos are blooper free and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.699 
most of my videos are blooper free and
that's<00:02:48.580> quite<00:02:49.060> ironic<00:02:49.570> because<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:50.200> my<00:02:50.290> daily

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
that's quite ironic because in my daily

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.250 
that's quite ironic because in my daily
life<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:51.190> made<00:02:51.370> quite<00:02:51.580> some<00:02:51.820> bloopers<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.600> drop

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
life I made quite some bloopers and drop

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.470 
life I made quite some bloopers and drop
things<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.130> for<00:02:54.430> Anna<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.180> walk

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
things on the for Anna of the walk

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.710 
things on the for Anna of the walk
against<00:02:55.989> things<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.430> usually<00:02:57.970> walk

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
against things like I usually walk

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.750 
against things like I usually walk
against<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.230> doorway<00:02:59.709> with<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.310> shoulders

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
against the doorway with my shoulders

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240 
against the doorway with my shoulders
because<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.239> over<00:03:01.540> anything<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.380> can<00:03:02.800> turn

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
because I over anything that I can turn

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.300 
because I over anything that I can turn
to<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.640> left<00:03:03.670> which<00:03:04.360> isn't<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.320> then<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.739> meet

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
to the left which isn't so then I meet

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.930 
to the left which isn't so then I meet
the<00:03:06.640> doorway<00:03:07.500> however<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.650> do<00:03:08.920> make<00:03:09.310> quite<00:03:09.670> some

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the doorway however I do make quite some

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.690 
the doorway however I do make quite some
mistakes<00:03:10.390> when<00:03:10.630> I'm<00:03:10.780> narrating<00:03:11.140> or<00:03:11.800> actually

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
mistakes when I'm narrating or actually

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.030 
mistakes when I'm narrating or actually
talking<00:03:13.239> life<00:03:13.540> into<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.080> camera<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:14.980> is

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
talking life into the camera and this is

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.490 
talking life into the camera and this is
first<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.910> all<00:03:16.060> because<00:03:16.390> English<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.019> not<00:03:17.320> my

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
first of all because English is not my

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.460 
first of all because English is not my
first<00:03:17.530> language<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:19.060> most<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:19.750> because

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
first language but most of all because

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.920 
first language but most of all because
I'm<00:03:20.799> not<00:03:21.190> really<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.760> much<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.540> talker

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
I'm not really that much of a talker

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.819 
I'm not really that much of a talker
anyway<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.370> usually<00:03:24.880> have<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.870> cut<00:03:26.170> out<00:03:26.320> big

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
anyway so I usually have to cut out big

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.520 
anyway so I usually have to cut out big
parts<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:27.400> which<00:03:27.549> I'm<00:03:27.790> thinking<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.870> then<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.290> am

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
parts in which I'm thinking so then I am

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.729 
parts in which I'm thinking so then I am
halfway<00:03:30.130> through<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.880> sentence<00:03:31.690> sentence<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
halfway through a sentence sentence and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.490 
halfway through a sentence sentence and
then<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.880> can't<00:03:34.329> remember<00:03:34.630> what<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.230> was

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
then I just can't remember what I was

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.530 
then I just can't remember what I was
talking<00:03:35.769> about<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.670> then<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.910> have<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.239> start

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
talking about and then I have to start

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.500 
talking about and then I have to start
over<00:03:37.750> because<00:03:38.560> most<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.190> what<00:03:39.459> I'm<00:03:40.000> telling

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
over because most of what I'm telling

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.140 
over because most of what I'm telling
you<00:03:40.840> right<00:03:41.110> now<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.620> simply<00:03:41.980> improvised<00:03:42.880> on

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
you right now is simply improvised on

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.930 
you right now is simply improvised on
spot<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:44.079> don't<00:03:44.560> really<00:03:44.829> have<00:03:45.190> any<00:03:45.430> scripts

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
spot so I don't really have any scripts

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.810 
spot so I don't really have any scripts
and<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.930> really<00:03:47.290> don't<00:03:47.470> read<00:03:47.799> from<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.489> paper

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
and I really don't read from a paper

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.940 
and I really don't read from a paper
although<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.390> do<00:03:49.570> sound<00:03:49.989> like<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.709> robot

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
although I do sound like a robot

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.610 
although I do sound like a robot
sometimes<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.030> that's<00:03:52.239> probably<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
sometimes but that's probably just the
