00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
want it's kind of a triangle right there

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.860 
want it's kind of a triangle right there
shape<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.360> shape<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.690> want<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.519> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
shape it to the shape you want and and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.720 
shape it to the shape you want and and
if<00:02:35.870> you've<00:02:35.989> done<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.230> correctly<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:36.920> about

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
if you've done it correctly that's about

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.199 
if you've done it correctly that's about
what<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.060> should<00:02:38.090> look<00:02:38.269> like<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:38.900> there<00:02:40.209> now

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
what it should look like right there now

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.289 
what it should look like right there now
the<00:02:41.630> last<00:02:41.870> step<00:02:42.230> is<00:02:42.579> basically<00:02:43.579> putting<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
the last step is basically putting a

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.470 
the last step is basically putting a
cover<00:02:44.900> on<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.950> inside<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.579> your<00:02:46.910> knot<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.420> you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
cover on this inside of your knot so you

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.520 
cover on this inside of your knot so you
push<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.019> around<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.819> can<00:02:50.380> push<00:02:51.380> it

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
push this around now you can push it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.100 
push this around now you can push it
around<00:02:51.829> all<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.310> way<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.630> kind<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.840> wrap

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
around all the way so you kind of wrap

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.890 
around all the way so you kind of wrap
that<00:02:54.410> inside<00:02:54.860> knot<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:56.560> push<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.829> up

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that inside knot and then push this up

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.680 
that inside knot and then push this up
through<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.340> hole<00:03:01.610> between<00:03:02.150> your<00:03:02.390> neck

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
through the the hole between your neck

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.740 
through the the hole between your neck
and<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.170> tie<00:03:03.380> one<00:03:04.190> more<00:03:04.430> time<00:03:04.700> now<00:03:05.359> once<00:03:05.569> we

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
and the tie one more time now once we

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.030 
and the tie one more time now once we
pull<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.109> through<00:03:06.410> we're<00:03:06.560> gonna<00:03:06.650> stick<00:03:07.010> it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
pull this through we're gonna stick it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.819 
pull this through we're gonna stick it
down<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.269> little<00:03:08.600> tunnel<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.709> we've

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
down this little tunnel that we've

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.610 
down this little tunnel that we've
created<00:03:10.160> see<00:03:10.639> when<00:03:10.819> we<00:03:10.910> go<00:03:11.060> around<00:03:11.180> back<00:03:11.620> we've

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
created see when we go around back we've

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.520 
created see when we go around back we've
essentially<00:03:13.100> created<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.730> little<00:03:14.000> tunnel<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
essentially created a little tunnel that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.860 
essentially created a little tunnel that
the<00:03:15.709> tie<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.250> pushed<00:03:16.519> through<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.780> you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
the tie can be pushed through so you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.240 
the tie can be pushed through so you
push<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.200> up<00:03:18.700> pull<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.730> through<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.440> then<00:03:21.440> you

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
push it up pull it through and then you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.860 
push it up pull it through and then you
open<00:03:22.579> up<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.850> little<00:03:23.180> tunnel<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.750> you've

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
open up this little tunnel that you've

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.150 
open up this little tunnel that you've
created<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.940> pull<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.090> tie<00:03:26.299> down<00:03:26.540> through

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
created and pull the tie down through

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.650 
created and pull the tie down through
keep<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.370> back<00:03:28.549> of<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.910> small<00:03:29.209> end<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:29.569> the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
keep the back of the small end in the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.650 
keep the back of the small end in the
begin<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.859> you<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.160> kind<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.549> tighten<00:03:31.970> it

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
begin and you just kind of tighten it

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.360 
begin and you just kind of tighten it
and<00:03:33.470> pull<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:34.210> like<00:03:35.210> so<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.890> can<00:03:37.070> shape<00:03:37.340> your

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
and pull it like so you can shape your

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.160 
and pull it like so you can shape your
knot<00:03:39.700> however<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.850> want<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.660> just<00:03:44.870> kind

voila now this tie is actually gonna be
a<00:04:05.060> little<00:04:05.240> bit<00:04:05.450> short<00:04:07.030> when<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.060> when<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.690> when<00:04:09.380> I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
a little bit short when I when I when I

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.540 
a little bit short when I when I when I
line<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:09.860> up<00:04:10.160> like<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.550> did<00:04:10.780> so<00:04:11.780> if<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:13.280> were<00:04:13.430> to

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
line it up like I did so if I were to

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.760 
line it up like I did so if I were to
tie<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:13.790> tie<00:04:14.150> again<00:04:14.540> which<00:04:15.080> I'm<00:04:15.440> not<00:04:15.590> gonna

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
tie this tie again which I'm not gonna

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.280 
tie this tie again which I'm not gonna
want<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.070> walk<00:04:16.190> around<00:04:16.370> with<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.790> short<00:04:17.060> time

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
want to walk around with the short time

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.400 
want to walk around with the short time
what<00:04:18.290> I'm<00:04:18.380> gonna<00:04:18.530> do<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:18.890> just<00:04:18.920> untie<00:04:19.520> it<00:04:20.410> but

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
what I'm gonna do is just untie it but

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.450 
what I'm gonna do is just untie it but
this<00:04:21.650> time<00:04:22.180> I'm<00:04:23.180> gonna<00:04:23.450> leave<00:04:23.750> even<00:04:24.200> less<00:04:24.470> I'm

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
this time I'm gonna leave even less I'm

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.060 
this time I'm gonna leave even less I'm
not<00:04:25.670> gonna<00:04:25.790> have<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.500> line<00:04:27.500> right<00:04:27.830> on<00:04:27.860> the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
not gonna have this line right on the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.770 
not gonna have this line right on the
tie<00:04:28.430> I'm<00:04:29.240> gonna<00:04:29.420> actually<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:32.240> farther

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
tie I'm gonna actually have it farther

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.180 
tie I'm gonna actually have it farther
down<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.410> have<00:04:33.590> less<00:04:34.120> area<00:04:35.120> on<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.510> side

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
down so I have less area on that side

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.760 
down so I have less area on that side
see<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:39.320> longer<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.770> make<00:04:39.980> this<00:04:40.220> in

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
see so the longer I make this in

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.700 
see so the longer I make this in
the<00:04:42.460> longer<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.720> long<00:04:43.930> end<00:04:44.170> will<00:04:44.350> be<00:04:44.380> in<00:04:44.590> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
the longer the long end will be in the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.620 
the longer the long end will be in the
end<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.580> so<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.880> just<00:04:46.060> kind<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:47.590> need<00:04:47.800> to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
end and so you just kind of you need to

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.050 
end and so you just kind of you need to
play<00:04:49.630> with<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:49.870> until<00:04:50.140> you<00:04:50.380> get<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.650> right<00:04:51.060> I'll

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
play with it until you get it right I'll

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.010 
play with it until you get it right I'll
do<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.360> again<00:04:53.460> see<00:04:54.460> if<00:04:54.520> we<00:04:54.960> can't<00:04:55.960> get<00:04:56.140> this

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
do it again see if we can't get this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:34.840
