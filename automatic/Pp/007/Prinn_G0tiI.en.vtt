00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
about Sony an IVC this week we talked a

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.640 
about Sony an IVC this week we talked a
lot<00:00:26.640> about<00:00:26.700> Sony<00:00:27.270> being<00:00:27.420> revolutionary

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
lot about Sony being revolutionary

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.450 
lot about Sony being revolutionary
where's<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.770> going<00:00:28.950> to<00:00:29.009> take<00:00:29.160> us<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
where's this going to take us in the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.160 
where's this going to take us in the
future<00:00:29.610> it's<00:00:30.240> interesting<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.720> mean<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
future it's interesting I mean that is a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.439 
future it's interesting I mean that is a
it<00:00:31.949> always<00:00:32.190> goes<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.400> to<00:00:32.760> the<00:00:32.850> core<00:00:33.059> aspect

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
it always goes back to the core aspect

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.189 
it always goes back to the core aspect
of<00:00:33.570> innovation<00:00:34.080> yeah<00:00:34.430> 20<00:00:35.430> years<00:00:35.610> ago<00:00:36.199> Sony

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
of innovation yeah 20 years ago Sony

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.380 
of innovation yeah 20 years ago Sony
invented<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.949> SDI<00:00:38.250> interface<00:00:38.699> since<00:00:39.150> then

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
invented the SDI interface since then

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
invented the SDI interface since then
this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.050> commonly<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.769> interface<00:00:41.190> by

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this is the commonly use interface by

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
this is the commonly use interface by
everybody<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.269> actually<00:00:42.540> deliver<00:00:42.750> hold<00:00:43.050> your

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
everybody to actually deliver hold your

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
everybody to actually deliver hold your
video<00:00:43.410> content<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:44.670> our<00:00:44.820> broadcast<00:00:45.239> domain

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
video content in our broadcast domain

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.540 
video content in our broadcast domain
but<00:00:46.409> the<00:00:46.500> world<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:47.159> moving<00:00:47.280> more

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
but the world is actually moving more

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
but the world is actually moving more
and<00:00:47.580> more<00:00:47.820> toward<00:00:47.940> IP<00:00:48.269> now<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:49.199> know<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and more toward IP now we know that you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110 
and more toward IP now we know that you
know<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.159> our<00:00:50.370> infrastructure<00:00:50.909> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
know a lot of our infrastructure that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
know a lot of our infrastructure that
mood<00:00:51.330> IP<00:00:51.720> but<00:00:52.290> yet<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.949> last<00:00:53.250> line<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
mood IP but yet the very last line that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
mood IP but yet the very last line that
is<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.479> connecting<00:00:54.870> IV<00:00:55.290> world<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.830> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
is actually connecting IV world and the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.009 
is actually connecting IV world and the
IP<00:00:56.159> domain<00:00:56.610> never<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.510> found<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> work

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
IP domain never really found the work

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.160 
IP domain never really found the work
way<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.460> real-time<00:00:59.909> IP<00:01:00.629> production

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
way to do it the real-time IP production

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
way to do it the real-time IP production
system<00:01:01.500> allows<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.159> transfer<00:01:02.640> audio

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
system allows actually to transfer audio

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
system allows actually to transfer audio
video<00:01:03.570> data<00:01:04.309> as<00:01:05.309> well<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.880> embedded

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
video data as well which are embedded

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.219 
video data as well which are embedded
into<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> through<00:01:07.290> an<00:01:07.530> IP<00:01:07.710> system<00:01:09.229> using

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
into it through an IP system using

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.920 
into it through an IP system using
conventional<00:01:10.560> IP<00:01:11.250> technology<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.299> network

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
conventional IP technology so network

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
conventional IP technology so network
cable<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> give<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.700> an<00:01:14.790> ID<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.240> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
cable so just to give you an ID for that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
cable so just to give you an ID for that
you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:16.020> imagine<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> amount<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
you know you can imagine the amount of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
you know you can imagine the amount of
cable<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.729> saved<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.170> an

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
cable that can be saved when you do an

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
cable that can be saved when you do an
OB<00:01:19.530> van<00:01:19.710> yo<00:01:19.859> you<00:01:19.950> construct<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> studio<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
OB van yo you construct the studio the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
OB van yo you construct the studio the
cost<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.899> saved<00:01:22.350> through<00:01:22.619> these<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.609> can

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
cost can be saved through these you can

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
cost can be saved through these you can
connect<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.329> studio<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:24.990> London<00:01:25.350> where<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
connect a studio in London where the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
connect a studio in London where the
camera<00:01:26.340> set<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.850> located<00:01:27.030> where<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
camera set would be located where the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.969 
camera set would be located where the
studio<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.530> example<00:01:28.590> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
studio would be for example in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.039 
studio would be for example in
Manchester<00:01:29.429> in<00:01:29.609> Paris<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.090> Berlin<00:01:30.359> right<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
Manchester in Paris or Berlin right and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.830 
Manchester in Paris or Berlin right and
this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.920> fundamentally<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.840> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
this is really fundamentally what is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.510 
this is really fundamentally what is
behind<00:01:34.049> these<00:01:34.439> real-time<00:01:34.679> IP<00:01:35.100> production

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
behind these real-time IP production

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
behind these real-time IP production
technology<00:01:35.969> but<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> doesn't<00:01:36.929> stop<00:01:37.020> there

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
technology but it doesn't stop there

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
technology but it doesn't stop there
because<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:37.679> allows<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.429> do<00:01:38.520> more

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
because it allows you as well to do more

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
because it allows you as well to do more
things<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.149> can<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.390> remote<00:01:39.659> maintenance<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
things you can do remote maintenance you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.080 
things you can do remote maintenance you
can<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.710> remote<00:01:41.039> monitoring<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.000> do

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
can do remote monitoring you can do

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
can do remote monitoring you can do
multi<00:01:42.420> casting<00:01:42.780> you're<00:01:42.990> sending<00:01:43.439> data<00:01:43.590> across

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
multi casting you're sending data across

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
multi casting you're sending data across
in<00:01:44.249> multiple<00:01:44.789> directions<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in multiple directions and it's really a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.340 
in multiple directions and it's really a
unique<00:01:46.740> system<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:48.240> its<00:01:48.420> own<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.200> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
unique system in its own right which is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
unique system in its own right which is
really<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:49.859> interesting<00:01:50.119> what<00:01:51.119> products

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
really really interesting what products

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
really really interesting what products
actually<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.469> excite<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.009> it's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
actually really excite you it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
actually really excite you it's
interesting<00:01:53.609> is<00:01:53.969> that<00:01:53.999> I've<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.659> around<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
interesting is that I've got around the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
interesting is that I've got around the
table<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.469> quite<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> few<00:01:55.979> products<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.579> so

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
table here quite a few products but so

lens<00:03:20.519> on<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.819> gyroscope<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.019> for<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.409> very

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
lens on the gyroscope so for the very

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.860 
lens on the gyroscope so for the very
first<00:03:22.889> time<00:03:23.040> it's<00:03:23.310> either<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.269> while<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
first time it's either the while the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
first time it's either the while the
camcorder<00:03:25.349> moves<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.829> lens<00:03:26.010> stay<00:03:26.280> stables

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
camcorder moves the lens stay stables

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.430 
camcorder moves the lens stay stables
yeah<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.750> again<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.019> don't<00:03:28.109> know<00:03:28.230> whether<00:03:28.349> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
yeah so again I don't know whether a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.629 
yeah so again I don't know whether a
camera<00:03:28.769> can<00:03:28.889> see<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.069> or<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.489> is

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
camera can see it or not but this is

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.460 
camera can see it or not but this is
really<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.599> unique<00:03:30.959> there<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.230> no<00:03:31.349> other

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
really really unique there is no other

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.629 
really really unique there is no other
product<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:31.949> marketplace<00:03:32.220> doing<00:03:32.549> this

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
product in the marketplace doing this

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.369 
product in the marketplace doing this
again<00:03:33.299> probably<00:03:33.870> one<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.079> best<00:03:34.199> hidden

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
again probably one of the best hidden

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.869 
again probably one of the best hidden
treasure<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.919> this<00:03:35.069> camera<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.579> nobody

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
treasure of this camera that nobody

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.089 
treasure of this camera that nobody
really<00:03:36.060> knows<00:03:36.269> about<00:03:36.709> when<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.799> go<00:03:37.919> more

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
really knows about when you go more

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.099 
really knows about when you go more
toward<00:03:38.459> more<00:03:38.910> visual<00:03:39.359> expression<00:03:39.810> of

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
toward more visual expression of

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.050 
toward more visual expression of
innovation<00:03:40.650> I've<00:03:41.190> got<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.579> product<00:03:42.030> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
innovation I've got here a product that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.550 
innovation I've got here a product that
was<00:03:42.239> known<00:03:42.419> by<00:03:42.629> our<00:03:42.660> consumer<00:03:43.260> colleagues

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
was known by our consumer colleagues

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.460 
was known by our consumer colleagues
last<00:03:43.769> week<00:03:43.980> for<00:03:44.400> example<00:03:44.790> which<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> DSC

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
last week for example which is the DSC

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.309 
last week for example which is the DSC
qx100<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:47.849> that<00:03:48.000> camera<00:03:48.419> because<00:03:49.169> it's

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
qx100 so that camera because it's

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.750 
qx100 so that camera because it's
actually<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.590> camera<00:03:49.859> it's<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.160> lens<00:03:50.430> yeah

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
actually a camera it's not a lens yeah

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.610 
actually a camera it's not a lens yeah
it's<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.000> camera<00:03:51.359> contains<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.900> sensor<00:03:52.260> behind

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
it's a camera contains a sensor behind

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.740 
it's a camera contains a sensor behind
and<00:03:52.889> so<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.069> so<00:03:53.099> forth<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.120> switch<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.629> on

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
and so on so forth so you switch it on

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.930 
and so on so forth so you switch it on
like<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.079> you<00:03:55.919> take<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.370> your<00:03:56.519> phone<00:03:56.730> can

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
like this you take it to your phone can

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.430 
like this you take it to your phone can
attach<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.419> literally<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:58.109> becomes<00:03:58.349> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
attach it literally and that becomes a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.099 
attach it literally and that becomes a
camera<00:03:58.739> yeah<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.209> pair<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.599> device<00:04:00.690> by

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
camera yeah you can pair the device by

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.960 
camera yeah you can pair the device by
near-field<00:04:01.440> communication<00:04:02.099> so<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.849> can

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
near-field communication so you can

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.520 
near-field communication so you can
actually<00:04:03.299> even<00:04:03.419> manipulate<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:04.109> from<00:04:04.260> remote

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
actually even manipulate it from remote

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.059 
actually even manipulate it from remote
so<00:04:04.799> again<00:04:05.489> really<00:04:06.060> interesting<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.859> part

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
so again really interesting and the part

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.099 
so again really interesting and the part
that<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.250> extract<00:04:08.699> from<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.120> me<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.359> as<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
that I extract from this for me is as a

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.780 
that I extract from this for me is as a
company's<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.829> ability<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.370> sometimes

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
company's the ability to sometimes

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.000 
company's the ability to sometimes
jeopardize<00:04:12.299> your<00:04:12.480> own<00:04:12.569> success<00:04:12.959> that's<00:04:13.799> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
jeopardize your own success that's the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.189 
jeopardize your own success that's the
key<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.940> really<00:04:15.419> push<00:04:15.720> yourself<00:04:15.750> in

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
key to really push yourself in

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.699 
key to really push yourself in
innovation<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:17.220> know<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:18.180> if<00:04:19.049> Sony<00:04:19.440> didn't

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
innovation you know we if Sony didn't

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.830 
innovation you know we if Sony didn't
launch<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.159> they<00:04:20.970> put<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.269> probably<00:04:21.570> you

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
launch that they put it probably you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.029 
launch that they put it probably you
have<00:04:21.930> taken<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.289> more<00:04:22.409> conservative<00:04:22.770> approach

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
have taken a more conservative approach

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.469 
have taken a more conservative approach
saying<00:04:23.370> oh<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.580> know<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.820> need<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.120> protect<00:04:24.419> my

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
saying oh you know I need to protect my

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.149 
saying oh you know I need to protect my
traditional<00:04:24.930> camera<00:04:25.260> business<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:25.800> no<00:04:25.979> they

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
traditional camera business but no they

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.770 
traditional camera business but no they
are<00:04:26.310> here<00:04:26.520> pushing<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:27.000> boundaries<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.659> know

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
are here pushing the boundaries you know

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.600 
are here pushing the boundaries you know
we<00:04:28.380> are<00:04:28.470> doing<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.740> same<00:04:28.889> with<00:04:29.039> this<00:04:29.190> we<00:04:29.430> could

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
we are doing the same with this we could

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.250 
we are doing the same with this we could
stay<00:04:29.789> with<00:04:30.000> traditional<00:04:30.510> SD<00:04:30.659> our<00:04:30.900> interface

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
stay with traditional SD our interface

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.140 
stay with traditional SD our interface
but<00:04:31.470> it's<00:04:31.590> got<00:04:31.740> many<00:04:31.949> downside<00:04:32.520> nowadays<00:04:32.909> and

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
but it's got many downside nowadays and

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.209 
but it's got many downside nowadays and
again<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.110> another<00:04:34.320> way<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> help<00:04:34.830> things

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
again this is another way to help things

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.760 
again this is another way to help things
before<00:04:35.580> work<00:04:35.729> so<00:04:36.210> that's<00:04:36.360> all<00:04:36.570> for<00:04:36.810> me

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
before work so that's all for me

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.980 
before work so that's all for me
in<00:04:37.860> essence<00:04:38.490> what<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.300> core<00:04:39.509> aspect<00:04:39.870> of

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
in essence what is the core aspect of

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.600 
in essence what is the core aspect of
Sony<00:04:40.169> innovation<00:04:40.650> terms<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.069> again<00:04:41.340> I'm<00:04:41.550> the
