the x-jet sears Cobra in the background
I<00:02:38.959> know<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.799> isn't<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.099> x-axis<00:02:40.610> guard

I know that isn't the x-axis guard

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.820 
I know that isn't the x-axis guard
that's<00:02:41.090> actually<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> X<00:02:41.690> Atkins<00:02:42.140> Cobra<00:02:42.709> that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
that's actually the X Atkins Cobra that

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.589 
that's actually the X Atkins Cobra that
all<00:02:42.950> Salvador<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.549> drove<00:02:44.019> at<00:02:45.099> Cobra<00:02:46.269> then<00:02:47.269> ship

all Salvador we drove at Cobra then ship

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.300 
all Salvador we drove at Cobra then ship
them<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.900> short<00:02:48.230> list<00:02:48.680> are<00:02:48.860> having<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.160> problem

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
them in short list are having a problem

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.520 
them in short list are having a problem
at<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> second<00:02:50.180> chica<00:02:50.540> yes<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.989> think<00:02:51.230> he<00:02:51.379> might

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
at the second chica yes I think he might

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.259 
at the second chica yes I think he might
be<00:02:51.560> sure<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.010> breaks<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.549> think<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.060> might<00:02:53.209> be

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
be sure to breaks I think that might be

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.990 
be sure to breaks I think that might be
a<00:02:53.420> problem<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:54.140> suspect<00:02:55.040> he's<00:02:55.220> got<00:02:55.430> some<00:02:55.730> sort

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
a problem I suspect he's got some sort

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.839 
a problem I suspect he's got some sort
of<00:02:56.180> problem<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.840> nature<00:02:57.079> because

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
of problem of that nature because

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.800 
of problem of that nature because
buncombe<00:02:58.849> doesn't<00:02:59.120> make<00:02:59.239> mistakes<00:02:59.329> like<00:02:59.690> that

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
buncombe doesn't make mistakes like that

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.360

if you did it be a problem when we've

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.069 
if you did it be a problem when we've
got<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.610> bits<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.880> reading<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.299> lead<00:03:02.450> that

racing cars come to that you know
there's<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:18.799> much<00:03:18.950> movement<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.519> Formula

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
there's as much movement in a Formula
