and<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> pieces<00:01:58.200> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and so these are one of the pieces that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.950 
and so these are one of the pieces that
make<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.890> difficult<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.729> historians<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
make it difficult for historians to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.370 
make it difficult for historians to
determine<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:02.759> took<00:02:02.969> place<00:02:03.380> this

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
determine what actually took place this

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.980 
determine what actually took place this
is<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> skill<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.610> used

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
is a skill that's going to be used

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.380 
is a skill that's going to be used
as<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.439> study<00:02:06.680> American<00:02:07.009> his<00:02:07.790> or<00:02:07.970> her<00:02:08.090> story

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
as you study American his or her story

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.389 
as you study American his or her story
this<00:02:08.660> year<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.500> we're<00:02:09.649> going<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.860> take<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.130> look

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
this year so we're going to take a look

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.030 
this year so we're going to take a look
at<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:10.640> break<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.150> down<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.300> little<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:12.040> so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
at this break it down a little bit so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.680 
at this break it down a little bit so
let's<00:02:13.400> take<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> look<00:02:13.849> at<00:02:13.970> an<00:02:14.030> example

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
let's take a look at an example

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.780 
let's take a look at an example
it<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.260> belief<00:02:15.560> students<00:02:16.010> should<00:02:16.160> do<00:02:16.250> 3<00:02:16.520> hours

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
it is belief students should do 3 hours

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.339 
it is belief students should do 3 hours
of<00:02:16.819> homework<00:02:17.030> every<00:02:17.480> night<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.230> ensure

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
of homework every night to ensure

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.130 
of homework every night to ensure
students<00:02:19.160> are<00:02:19.489> understanding<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.540> concepts

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
students are understanding the concepts

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.809 
students are understanding the concepts
taught<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.500> class<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.660> first<00:02:24.590> question<00:02:24.819> whose

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
taught in class so first question whose

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.830 
taught in class so first question whose
point<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.209> view<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:29.300> said<00:02:29.540> teacher

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
point of view is this you said teacher

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.180 
point of view is this you said teacher
you<00:02:30.380> are<00:02:30.410> correct

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
you are correct

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.100 
you are correct
teachers<00:02:31.880> would<00:02:32.060> think<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.450> students

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
teachers would think that students

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.870 
teachers would think that students
should<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.349> doing<00:02:33.400> more<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.489> more<00:02:34.580> homework

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
should be doing more and more homework

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.759 
should be doing more and more homework
so<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.390> they're<00:02:35.569> completely<00:02:36.170> prepared<00:02:36.590> for

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
so that they're completely prepared for

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.039 
so that they're completely prepared for
class<00:02:39.459> now<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.850> there<00:02:41.120> any<00:02:41.269> bias<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.900> this

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
class now is there any bias in this

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.240 
class now is there any bias in this
statement<00:02:42.970> yes<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.690> bias<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.590> amount<00:02:46.040> of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
statement yes the bias is the amount of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.039 
statement yes the bias is the amount of
homework<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.760> should<00:02:47.000> be<00:02:47.150> done<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.930> is

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
homework that should be done that is

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.280 
homework that should be done that is
coming<00:02:48.319> from<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.769> teacher's<00:02:49.340> point<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.819> view<00:02:50.290> so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
coming from a teacher's point of view so

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.170 
coming from a teacher's point of view so
for<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.650> put<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.040> back<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> students

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
for you to put this back on the students

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.150 
for you to put this back on the students
and<00:02:53.360> ask<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.140> write<00:02:54.319> your<00:02:54.440> own<00:02:54.680> statement

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
and ask you to write your own statement

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.740 
and ask you to write your own statement
of<00:02:55.430> homework<00:02:55.959> what<00:02:56.959> would<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:58.750> many

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
of homework what would it be many

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.590 
of homework what would it be many
students<00:03:00.230> may<00:03:00.799> come<00:03:01.040> back<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.250> say<00:03:01.600> students

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
students may come back and say students

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.559 
students may come back and say students
should<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.870> any<00:03:03.080> homework<00:03:03.700> we<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.910> we<00:03:05.450> have

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
should do any homework we have we have

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.890 
should do any homework we have we have
other<00:03:05.780> things<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.470> we<00:03:06.620> have<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.750> we're<00:03:08.750> in

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
other things that we have to do we're in

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.110 
other things that we have to do we're in
school<00:03:09.019> for<00:03:09.349> 6<00:03:09.590> hours<00:03:09.980> already<00:03:10.400> six<00:03:10.850> seven

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
school for 6 hours already six seven

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.210 
school for 6 hours already six seven
hours<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.450> day<00:03:11.540> when<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.410> go<00:03:12.560> home<00:03:12.769> we<00:03:13.100> don't

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
hours a day when we go home we don't

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.319 
hours a day when we go home we don't
want<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.609> have<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.910> do<00:03:14.030> more<00:03:14.060> schoolwork<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:17.060> as

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
want to have to do more schoolwork so as

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.569 
want to have to do more schoolwork so as
you<00:03:17.480> can<00:03:17.630> see<00:03:17.690> there<00:03:18.230> are<00:03:18.430> different<00:03:19.430> points

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
you can see there are different points

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.940 
you can see there are different points
of<00:03:19.820> view<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.560> students<00:03:21.560> are<00:03:21.650> gonna<00:03:21.739> have

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
of view here students are gonna have

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.949 
of view here students are gonna have
their<00:03:22.100> bias<00:03:22.400> teachers<00:03:23.299> are<00:03:23.420> gonna<00:03:23.540> have<00:03:23.780> their

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
their bias teachers are gonna have their

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.720 
their bias teachers are gonna have their
bias<00:03:24.260> you're<00:03:24.829> looking<00:03:25.100> at<00:03:25.220> two<00:03:25.519> different

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
bias you're looking at two different

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.990 
bias you're looking at two different
points<00:03:26.209> of<00:03:26.269> view

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
points of view

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000 
points of view
so<00:03:29.000> as<00:03:29.269> we're<00:03:29.840> talking<00:03:30.260> about<00:03:30.350> this<00:03:30.650> we<00:03:30.829> just

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
so as we're talking about this we just

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.770 
so as we're talking about this we just
want<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.250> break<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.579> down<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:32.030> make<00:03:32.209> sure<00:03:32.510> that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
want to break it down and make sure that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.099 
want to break it down and make sure that
you<00:03:33.019> still<00:03:33.640> understand<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.690> terms<00:03:36.019> that

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
you still understand the terms that

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.380 
you still understand the terms that
we're<00:03:36.319> talking<00:03:36.739> about<00:03:36.859> first<00:03:37.850> one<00:03:38.090> we'll<00:03:38.209> take

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
we're talking about first one we'll take

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.360 
we're talking about first one we'll take
a<00:03:38.450> look<00:03:38.750> at<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:38.989> point<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.410> view<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.340> a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
a look at this point of view this is a

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.550 
a look at this point of view this is a
person's<00:03:41.030> opinion<00:03:41.660> about<00:03:41.959> an<00:03:42.109> issue<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.470> an

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
person's opinion about an issue in an

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.539 
person's opinion about an issue in an
event<00:03:44.049> when<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.079> see<00:03:45.410> something<00:03:45.739> do<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.310> see

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
event when I see something do I see

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.520 
event when I see something do I see
something<00:03:46.970> differently<00:03:47.329> from<00:03:47.900> somebody<00:03:48.319> else

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
something differently from somebody else

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.970 
something differently from somebody else
so<00:03:48.889> that's<00:03:49.459> what<00:03:49.700> makes<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.060> point<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.510> view

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
so that's what makes the point of view

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.680 
so that's what makes the point of view
the<00:03:51.980> second<00:03:52.549> concept<00:03:52.970> we're<00:03:53.239> taking<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.569> look

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the second concept we're taking a look

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.379 
the second concept we're taking a look
at<00:03:53.900> today<00:03:54.079> is<00:03:54.170> multiple<00:03:54.950> perspectives<00:03:55.639> when

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
at today is multiple perspectives when

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.849 
at today is multiple perspectives when
they<00:03:56.510> have<00:03:56.630> more<00:03:56.900> than<00:03:57.049> one<00:03:57.319> point<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.799> view

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
they have more than one point of view

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.670 
they have more than one point of view
about<00:03:58.760> an<00:03:58.880> issue<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.780> background<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:00.530> an

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
about an issue the background in an

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.979 
about an issue the background in an
event<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.340> individual<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:02.359> impact

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
event and the individual can impact

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.379 
event and the individual can impact
their<00:04:03.290> point<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.739> view<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.150> when<00:04:05.269> you're

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
their point of view so when you're

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.289 
their point of view so when you're
talking<00:04:05.750> about<00:04:05.840> slavery<00:04:06.430> slave<00:04:07.430> owners<00:04:08.030> are

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
talking about slavery slave owners are

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.920 
talking about slavery slave owners are
going<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:09.319> point<00:04:09.889> of<00:04:10.100> view

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
going to have a point of view

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.869 
going to have a point of view
and<00:04:11.379> so<00:04:11.829> our<00:04:12.299> slaves<00:04:13.299> themselves<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:15.310> how<00:04:15.610> they

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
and so our slaves themselves so how they

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.789 
and so our slaves themselves so how they
see<00:04:16.269> something<00:04:16.840> or<00:04:16.989> how<00:04:17.109> they<00:04:17.229> talk<00:04:17.470> about

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
see something or how they talk about

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.740 
see something or how they talk about
something<00:04:18.370> they're<00:04:18.940> coming<00:04:19.269> from<00:04:19.389> two

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
something they're coming from two

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.540 
something they're coming from two
different<00:04:19.780> perspectives<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:23.190> then<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.370> last

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
different perspectives and then the last

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.300 
different perspectives and then the last
one<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:24.970> biased<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.930> Anjali<00:04:26.560> is<00:04:26.680> an<00:04:26.800> opinion

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
one is biased and Anjali is an opinion

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.620 
one is biased and Anjali is an opinion
or<00:04:27.460> distortion<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.350> judgment<00:04:29.350> about<00:04:29.500> an<00:04:29.919> event

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
or distortion of judgment about an event

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.890 
or distortion of judgment about an event
so<00:04:31.630> when<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:31.870> take<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.139> look<00:04:32.440> at<00:04:32.710> bias<00:04:33.900> people

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
so when you take a look at bias people

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.360 
so when you take a look at bias people
are<00:04:35.199> going<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.590> no<00:04:35.680> matter<00:04:35.710> what<00:04:36.190> they're

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
are going to no matter what they're

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.290 
are going to no matter what they're
going<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.729> be<00:04:36.970> leaning<00:04:37.240> one<00:04:37.570> way<00:04:37.630> or<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.080> other

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
going to be leaning one way or the other

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.150 
going to be leaning one way or the other
so<00:04:40.300> we're<00:04:40.600> not<00:04:40.690> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.020> look<00:04:41.199> at<00:04:41.380> this<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.889> I

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
so we're not going to look at this and I

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.659 
so we're not going to look at this and I
say<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:43.260> for<00:04:44.260> example<00:04:44.410> what<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.400> best

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
say that for example what is the best

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.529 
say that for example what is the best
state<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.120> live<00:04:46.300> in

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
state to live in

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.379 
state to live in
some<00:04:47.440> people<00:04:47.740> may<00:04:47.860> say<00:04:47.889> Maryland<00:04:48.610> has<00:04:49.120> that's

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
some people may say Maryland has that's

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.840 
some people may say Maryland has that's
what<00:04:49.660> it's<00:04:49.840> wrong<00:04:50.460> someone<00:04:51.460> might<00:04:51.610> say

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
what it's wrong someone might say

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.850 
what it's wrong someone might say
Florida<00:04:52.240> because<00:04:53.199> that's<00:04:53.440> where<00:04:53.710> they're

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
Florida because that's where they're

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.000 
Florida because that's where they're
from<00:04:54.270> if<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.389> were<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.690> say<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.470> would<00:04:56.830> say

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
from if I were to say this I would say

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.300 
from if I were to say this I would say
Minnesota<00:04:57.580> because<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.570> grew<00:04:58.780> up<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:59.080> Minnesota

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
Minnesota because I grew up in Minnesota

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.560 
Minnesota because I grew up in Minnesota
and<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.630> have<00:05:02.229> that<00:05:02.560> unreason<00:05:03.370> opinion<00:05:03.910> I'm

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
and so I have that unreason opinion I'm

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.969 
and so I have that unreason opinion I'm
not<00:05:04.810> looking<00:05:05.260> at<00:05:05.410> everything

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
not looking at everything

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.460 
not looking at everything
I'm<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.550> narrowing<00:05:07.030> my<00:05:07.060> focus<00:05:07.240> in<00:05:07.900> on<00:05:08.080> that

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
I'm just narrowing my focus in on that

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.680 
I'm just narrowing my focus in on that
one<00:05:08.830> certain<00:05:09.669> idea<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:13.060> that's<00:05:13.330> everything

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
one certain idea so that's everything

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.230 
one certain idea so that's everything
