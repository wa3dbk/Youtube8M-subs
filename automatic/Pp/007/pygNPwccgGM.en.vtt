will move so much available that the

is<00:00:52.229> very<00:00:53.039> often<00:00:53.429> one<00:00:54.239> tenth<00:00:54.690> or<00:00:54.989> less<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.769> the

is very often one tenth or less of the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fish that were there before you stuff so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
fish that were there before you stuff so
much<00:01:03.899> technology<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.830> boat<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
much technology in your boat that you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.360 
much technology in your boat that you
you<00:01:07.080> transform<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.210> tank<00:01:10.370> it

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
you transform them into two to tank it

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.450 
you transform them into two to tank it
is<00:01:11.520> almost<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.720> use<00:01:12.930> our<00:01:13.170> military

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
is almost as if we we use our military

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
is almost as if we we use our military
to<00:01:14.460> fight<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:16.080> animals<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> ocean<00:01:17.960> we<00:01:18.960> are
