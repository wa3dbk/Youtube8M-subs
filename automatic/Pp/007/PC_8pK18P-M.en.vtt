00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
at diner I started a game on solo just

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
at diner I started a game on solo just
run<00:00:17.820> straight<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> diner<00:00:18.539> haven't<00:00:19.439> got

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
run straight to the diner haven't got

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.120 
run straight to the diner haven't got
any<00:00:19.619> perks

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
any perks

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
any perks
except<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.609> persistent<00:00:21.600> jug<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.140> check<00:00:22.320> out

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
except for persistent jug so check out

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.990 
except for persistent jug so check out
my<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.619> video<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> get

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
my other video if you don't how to get

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.320 
my other video if you don't how to get
that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
that
so<00:00:24.840> yeah<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> idea<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:26.130> kill

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
so yeah the idea is to just not kill

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880 
so yeah the idea is to just not kill
anybody<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:27.029> all<00:00:27.180> when<00:00:27.660> he<00:00:27.689> zombie<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.289> insta

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
anybody at all when he zombie on insta

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.589 
anybody at all when he zombie on insta
kill<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.150> nothing<00:00:30.570> really

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
kill and as you can see nothing really

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.479 
kill and as you can see nothing really
happens<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.650> don't<00:00:31.830> kill<00:00:31.949> any<00:00:32.099> zombie

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
happens you just don't kill any zombie

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
happens you just don't kill any zombie
and<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.059> integral<00:00:33.450> goes<00:00:33.630> away<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.590> do

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and the integral goes away so you do

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
and the integral goes away so you do
that<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.370> time<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> second

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that the first time but it's the second

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
that the first time but it's the second
time<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.890> second<00:00:38.250> time<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> insta

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
time the second time you get the insta

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.930 
time the second time you get the insta
kill<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> don't<00:00:40.230> kill<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> zombie<00:00:40.940> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
kill and you don't kill a zombie you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
kill and you don't kill a zombie you
should<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> green<00:00:42.719> flash<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.410> indicate

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
should see the green flash to indicate

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
should see the green flash to indicate
that<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> persistent<00:00:44.820> perp<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that it was a persistent perp so that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
that it was a persistent perp so that
you<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.559> mega<00:00:47.550> kill<00:00:47.879> or

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you have actually got mega kill or

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
you have actually got mega kill or
persistent<00:00:49.020> insta<00:00:49.350> kill<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
persistent insta kill so we will see in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
persistent insta kill so we will see in
a<00:00:51.329> minute<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.930> killing<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> zombie<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
a minute I'm not killing a zombie that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
a minute I'm not killing a zombie that
he<00:00:53.250> brutally<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.960> again<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
he brutally and again it's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
he brutally and again it's
counterintuitive<00:00:55.440> most<00:00:56.250> people<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.670> they

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
counterintuitive most people when they

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
counterintuitive most people when they
get<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> kills<00:00:57.329> kill<00:00:57.570> zombies<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.379> this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
get into the kills kill zombies so this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
get into the kills kill zombies so this
is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> good<00:00:59.010> good<00:00:59.760> discovery<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> good

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
is a good good discovery and a good

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170 
is a good good discovery and a good
thing<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.430> too<00:01:02.789> sure<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
thing this out there I'm not too sure on

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.679 
thing this out there I'm not too sure on
how<00:01:03.420> useful<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.400> but<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.450> very

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
how useful it is but it's very very

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.120 
how useful it is but it's very very
interesting<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:07.920> see

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
interesting so there we go we can see

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.710 
interesting so there we go we can see
the<00:01:08.250> green<00:01:08.490> flash<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.119> actually<00:01:09.390> taken<00:01:09.540> place

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
the green flash has actually taken place
to<00:01:10.170> indicate<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> persistent<00:01:11.369> perk<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to indicate the persistent perk so that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.710 
to indicate the persistent perk so that
is<00:01:12.720> how<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> unlock<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:14.070> happen<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> me<00:01:14.970> to

the insta kill symbol and what that does

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
the insta kill symbol and what that does
is<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> walk<00:01:26.220> into<00:01:26.580> zombies<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
is when you walk into zombies when you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
is when you walk into zombies when you
touch<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.170> zombie<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.430> hurt<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.820> the

touch a zombie they do not hurt you the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.359 
touch a zombie they do not hurt you the
head<00:01:30.479> completely<00:01:31.200> explodes<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> zombie

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
head completely explodes or the zombie

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.800 
head completely explodes or the zombie

could<00:01:40.710> test<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> next<00:01:41.490> theory<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
could test out the next theory and the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
could test out the next theory and the
next<00:01:42.930> theory<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> unlock

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
next theory is so we know how to unlock

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.139 
next theory is so we know how to unlock
it<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> stay<00:01:46.710> every<00:01:47.430> time<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.909> I'll

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it but will it stay every time now I'll

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
it but will it stay every time now I'll
get<00:01:48.270> an<00:01:48.360> insta-kill<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
get an insta-kill will I have a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.120 
get an insta-kill will I have a
persistent<00:01:50.659> insta<00:01:51.659> kill<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.829> let's<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
persistent insta kill so let's have a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.300 
persistent insta kill so let's have a
look<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.990> yet<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> very<00:01:55.320> next<00:01:55.680> insta<00:01:56.159> kill

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
look and yet the very next insta kill

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
look and yet the very next insta kill
that<00:01:56.520> I've<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.880> I've<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.780> red<00:01:57.960> skull

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that I've got I've got the red skull

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.310 
that I've got I've got the red skull

again so again I just walked into a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
zombie to kill him and had no intention

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.980 
zombie to kill him and had no intention
of<00:02:04.409> shooting<00:02:04.469> zombies<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.549> every<00:02:06.509> insta<00:02:06.869> kill

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
of shooting zombies and every insta kill

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
of shooting zombies and every insta kill
