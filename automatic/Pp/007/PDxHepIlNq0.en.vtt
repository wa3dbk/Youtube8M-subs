00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
skill-based Drive in which I found

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
skill-based Drive in which I found
slightly<00:00:40.110> difficult<00:00:40.730> I've<00:00:41.730> got<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> simulator

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
slightly difficult I've got a simulator

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
slightly difficult I've got a simulator
here<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:42.989> simulates<00:00:43.770> driving<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.219> ice<00:00:44.309> ax

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
here which simulates driving and ice ax

here which simulates driving and ice ax
so<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:45.030> round<00:00:45.180> cones<00:00:45.510> braking<00:00:46.410> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so to get round cones braking really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
so to get round cones braking really
hard<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.129> overtake<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.850> high<00:00:47.969> speeds

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
hard and overtake it at high speeds

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
hard and overtake it at high speeds
which<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.989> illegal<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.590> normal<00:00:50.280> roads<00:00:50.399> but

which is all illegal on normal roads but

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
which is all illegal on normal roads but
really<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.180> fun<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:52.230> well<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.500> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
was terrible not to overload two cones

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.380 
was terrible not to overload two cones
but<00:01:08.010> he's<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.760> challenging

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

the brakes so I assumed from that I'd

I managed to emerge the pass which was
which<00:04:22.949> was<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:23.280> good<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.789> possibly<00:04:24.300> there

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
which was very good and possibly there
