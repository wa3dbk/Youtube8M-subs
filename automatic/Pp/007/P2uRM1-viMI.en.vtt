 not a lot of makeup videos 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.230
 but if there was one I had 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.820

 you will be able to quickly discover the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.850
 chains of each so here is a 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.070
 honest and makeup since I find 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.649
 that she really has a pretty technique 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.390
 pointy and that's me it's my dream in 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.200
 to know how to make up a little like 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.990
 all these girls 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.210
 I'm really me there the classic 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.800
 hall where the son simplistic but 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.929
 extremely simplistic makeup 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.000
 that's it, but we're really here 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.140
 tablecloth that for me actually has to 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.440
 the technique in his makeup 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.330
 then what youtube is what you 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.429
 love for his good mood 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.259
 so it's true that I really like my 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.869
 havana and then if you know her 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.880
 I do not appear you will have the link anbar 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.950
 dafoe I really like we actually did 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.660
 this is the second one I followed on 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.369
 Youtube 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.959
 when I discovered all this video there 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.270
 kill everything youtube this is where the second 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.440
 nobody I discovered and I'm leaving 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.759
 I remember a time when I 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 watched all the time these videos games 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.649
 have a good time or would not it 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.110
 that his first introductory sentence 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.000
 lotenese lots have like me as 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.679
 sometimes we have two lives departing here and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.330
 then she always had her smile and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.040
 here she always has this 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.930
 that she picked up youtube and that's it and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.270
 and then his laughter after this sentence without 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.130
 voices the press and mouna and jamila and 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.760
 that's it if there was one person that I 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.900
 will remember what would she follow she 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.530
 youtube huzz is what you like for 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.540
 its natural 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.000
 so I selected two duthieuw 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.830
 buzz so there is bio r 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.270
 as a blessing of the organic chain is so 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.680
 I really like what is very simple 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.300
 very natural she is really 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.220
 itself and then there are a lot 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.530
 caramel beauty too because she 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.660
 really very sweet very much for you 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.730
 you feel the sweetness what are you so 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.870
 these is carole beauty she is hyper 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.640
 12 helpers 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.830
 we have the impression that this is the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.540
 sweetness embodied is the zen attitude 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.160
 of total here for its naturalness 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.900
 and then there are girls who are 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.560
 not really natural in their way 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.300
 to be in the eure excuse me a sms 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.180
 so that's this stress and youtube two 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.030
 there then what youtuber is what you 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.860
 love for his physical beauty then 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.410
 physical beauty and in addition to that I 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.940
 would add for its beauty hair 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.020
 everything that physical beauty sees 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.780
 during it's something pretty 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.430
 ephemeral but now and as I am 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.480
 more attached that I'm very interested 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.370
 more to the hair so I would say 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.860
 cassandre beke it's a youtube buzz 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.540
 who finally sees beneath his face 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.040
 physically she is really very 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.320
 pretty and on top of that she has a 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.160
 beautiful hair really a 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.950
 dreamy hair 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.080
 and so that's so it's a little what 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.720
 I find really very pretty and as much 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.959
 physical only in its in its state 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.459
 capillary she youtube buzz is this 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.940
 that you like for his creativity 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.000
 so here I selected one 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.140
 bluff selection so I discovered 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.299
 bags not very long ago and 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.950
 I really like these videos his creativity 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.299
 in the fine sense some themes of these 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.040
 videos are pretty funny when it's 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.130
 fun so I quote you two can 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.980
 so the video titled is not won 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.030
 and youtube two made me buy 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 So here I invite you to go see 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.570
 these two little videos in his opinion not 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.489
 badly then what youtube that's what 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.860
 you love for her life here is another 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.269
 times we can not really like 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.410
 someone on youtube for his life because 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.060
 we do not know people's lives 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 but there is one person that I had 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.470
 hold back 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.080
 it would finally be a chain told itself 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.780
 natural scoring because it's a 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.010
 mom who has kids girls and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.800
 her little ones in fact she takes care of everything 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.419
 only once in a while their hair 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.980
 not all the time but she's busy 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.350
 all seven of their hair so actually 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.570
 that would be an element of the work of his 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.730
 life or their life we ​​are really time 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.880
 that mom does that some she 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.160
 initiates in time the girl yes reaches yes 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.410
 I arrive in time I arrive I am and 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.300
 medium offices with me so that's 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.450
 really the fact that she initiates her 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.260
 girls to maintain their own 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.080
