an<00:02:25.920> RPG<00:02:26.400> now<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.239> very<00:02:27.390> impressed<00:02:27.810> by

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
an RPG now I was not very impressed by

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.199 
an RPG now I was not very impressed by
this<00:02:29.360> as<00:02:30.360> i<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> pretty<00:02:32.489> nice<00:02:32.790> kill

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
this as i was on a pretty nice kill

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.630 
this as i was on a pretty nice kill
streak<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.010> considering<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.280> my<00:02:35.489> only

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
streak and considering this is my only

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.550 
streak and considering this is my only
death<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.420> pretty<00:02:36.829> BS<00:02:37.829> move<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:39.319> was<00:02:40.319> going

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
death that's pretty BS move I was going

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.900 
death that's pretty BS move I was going
for<00:02:40.680> some<00:02:41.810> some<00:02:42.810> kill<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.739> thought<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.250> knew<00:02:44.790> he

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
for some some kill I thought I knew he

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
for some some kill I thought I knew he
was<00:02:44.970> back<00:02:45.209> there<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.230> stupid<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
was back there it was kind of stupid of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.580 
was back there it was kind of stupid of
me<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.739> go<00:02:46.859> back<00:02:47.100> there<00:02:47.130> anyway<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.750> thought

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
me to go back there anyway but I thought

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.530 
me to go back there anyway but I thought
that<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.100> nade<00:02:50.370> launcher<00:02:50.639> oh<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.209> if<00:02:51.359> I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that it is nade launcher oh and if I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.240 
that it is nade launcher oh and if I
come<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.260> quick<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.829> find<00:02:53.069> nice

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
come in really quick and I find nice

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.830 
come in really quick and I find nice
through<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.730> around<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.329> corner<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
through that around that corner I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.650 
through that around that corner I
thought<00:02:54.989> he<00:02:55.139> wouldn't<00:02:55.319> have<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
thought he wouldn't have a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.840 
thought he wouldn't have a
ances<00:02:55.990> it<00:02:56.710> would<00:02:56.830> be<00:02:56.920> too<00:02:57.130> close<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
ances it would be too close and the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.700 
ances it would be too close and the
native<00:02:58.300> wouldn't<00:02:58.600> blow<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.350> grenade

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
native wouldn't blow up the grenade

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.910 
native wouldn't blow up the grenade
launcher<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.930> ends<00:03:02.140> up<00:03:02.290> being<00:03:02.500> my<00:03:02.710> only

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
launcher so that ends up being my only

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.720 
launcher so that ends up being my only
death<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:04.300> time<00:03:04.570> I'm<00:03:05.230> going<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.730> change

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
death and this time I'm going to change

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.960 
death and this time I'm going to change
it<00:03:06.850> up<00:03:06.970> again<00:03:07.270> yet<00:03:07.480> again<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:08.530> rush<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.190> pretty

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
it up again yet again this rush I pretty

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.210 
it up again yet again this rush I pretty
much<00:03:10.090> have<00:03:10.600> never<00:03:10.990> done<00:03:11.170> before<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.620> will<00:03:11.950> admit

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
much have never done before I will admit

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.920 
much have never done before I will admit
this<00:03:12.490> is<00:03:12.550> like<00:03:12.970> probably<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.360> most<00:03:13.540> risky

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
this is like probably the most risky

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.720 
this is like probably the most risky
roster<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.440> actually<00:03:14.830> do<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.430> map

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
roster you can actually do in this map

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.150 
roster you can actually do in this map
