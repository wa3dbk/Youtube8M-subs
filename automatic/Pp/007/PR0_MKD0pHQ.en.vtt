00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
of certain moves they improved AI

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210 
of certain moves they improved AI
behavior<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.509> tag-team<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> Royal<00:01:22.710> Rumble

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
improve that springboard attacks against

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
improve that springboard attacks against
grounded<00:01:32.369> opponents<00:01:32.880> who<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.030> reacting<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
grounded opponents who are reacting and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
grounded opponents who are reacting and
recovering<00:01:34.500> will<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.250> animate<00:01:35.790> more

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
recovering will now animate more

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
recovering will now animate more
naturally<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.409> hope<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> physics

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
naturally and I hope that's a physics

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
naturally and I hope that's a physics
thing<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.700> hope<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:38.939> implemented<00:01:39.570> some<00:01:39.750> more

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
thing I hope they implemented some more

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
thing I hope they implemented some more
physics<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.880> players<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.060> now<00:01:42.180> able<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
physics to that players are now able to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 
physics to that players are now able to
use<00:01:42.630> tag<00:01:43.140> team<00:01:43.409> finishes<00:01:43.920> properly<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
use tag team finishes properly with a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.679 
use tag team finishes properly with a
custom<00:01:45.570> created<00:01:45.930> tag<00:01:46.290> team<00:01:47.270> comebacks<00:01:48.270> should

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
custom created tag team comebacks should

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
custom created tag team comebacks should
now<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:49.020> easier<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.500> perform<00:01:49.680> yeah<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.790> were

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
now be easier to perform yeah they were

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370 
now be easier to perform yeah they were
I<00:01:51.210> almost<00:01:51.509> didn't<00:01:51.780> even<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> any

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I almost didn't even want to do any

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
I almost didn't even want to do any
comebacks<00:01:52.829> cuz<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:53.640> don't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
