 long lance just for cuadrado changes 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.890
 step cuadrado finds the bottom line 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.269
 manages to keep this word in the field 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.220
 he does not pull back instead for pepito 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.900
 reds that cold so cock every day 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.930
 better better 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.690
 I learn so much every day and I still think 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.600
 two three months I can give 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.030
 an interview an interview in Italian 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.290
 very well that we see a little tried 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.700
 from the game it was a match 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.480
 intense it was absolutely not 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.160
 maybe a friendly one 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.530
 if it's only 45 minutes for all the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.100
 mister said we had to go 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.299
 we all have to show what we have 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:54.010
 made workouts 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:56.140
 I think we have seen that we have 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.700
 need time again but also that 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.890
 something works works 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.180
 already work I've seen that you have 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.890
 also tried the movements you have 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.469
 tested this morning together with 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.629
 mister 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.519
 what moves the start with the ball 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.370
 from behind with the two central phases 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:22.120
 offensive tactics offensive phase 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:24.699
 I think we don't change so much the year 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.500
 last but I think after six weeks 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:35.560
 rest break we need time 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:39.030
 to take the strength to get out again 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.970
 you also get to know new players 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.410
 see we'll see in the coming weeks 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.000
 which can reach up to this 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.560
 Florentine 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.860
 if they work it works and we work 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.669
 as a team we can do much worse 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.030
 we can do great things but it depends on 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.030
 all 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.160
 if we must we must work 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.440
 we must never give up working e 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.880
 to grow if we all think so 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.710
 we can do beautiful things 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.139
 feel the president's arrival has you 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.699

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:25.470
