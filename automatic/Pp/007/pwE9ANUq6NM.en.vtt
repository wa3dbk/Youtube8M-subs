Lebanon that type of area is your
ancestral<00:00:43.819> origins<00:00:44.300> now<00:00:45.079> this<00:00:45.229> group<00:00:45.559> then

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
ancestral origins now this group then

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.090 
ancestral origins now this group then
migrated<00:00:46.339> across<00:00:47.329> Europe<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:47.960> that's<00:00:48.920> why

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
migrated across Europe and that's why

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.270 
migrated across Europe and that's why
you've<00:00:49.249> ended<00:00:49.489> up<00:00:49.609> here<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.059> UK<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.620> my<00:00:51.859> DNA

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
you've ended up here in the UK so my DNA

you've ended up here in the UK so my DNA
suggests<00:00:52.969> i<00:00:53.149> have<00:00:53.420> Jewish<00:00:53.780> ancestors<00:00:54.170> and
