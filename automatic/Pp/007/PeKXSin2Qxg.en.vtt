never<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.590> seen<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> rock<00:01:38.100> polisher<00:01:38.430> one

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
never really seen a rock polisher one

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.569 
never really seen a rock polisher one
and<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.210> turns<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.780> physical<00:01:40.579> or

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and it turns out to be a physical or

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
and it turns out to be a physical or
regice<00:01:42.030> which<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.360> thought<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.930> actually

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
regice which I thought was actually

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.340 
regice which I thought was actually
pretty<00:01:43.350> cool<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.759> since<00:01:45.180> red<00:01:45.960> eyes<00:01:46.140> don't

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
pretty cool but since red eyes don't

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
pretty cool but since red eyes don't
have<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> best<00:01:46.770> physical<00:01:47.700> attack<00:01:47.909> around

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
have the best physical attack around

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
have the best physical attack around
that<00:01:48.540> does<00:01:48.750> practically<00:01:49.259> nothing<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.799> me<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that does practically nothing to me and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
that does practically nothing to me and
I<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.420> through<00:01:51.659> toxic<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.380> luckily<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.740> does

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I go through toxic and luckily it does

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
I go through toxic and luckily it does
hit<00:01:53.130> cuz<00:01:53.700> um<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.540> actually<00:01:54.720> come<00:01:54.990> in

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
hit cuz um that would actually come in

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
hit cuz um that would actually come in
handy<00:01:55.290> later<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.700> just

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:29.029 
i can easily set up on it but he

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.540 
i can easily set up on it but he
actually<00:04:29.180> has<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.479> Avalanche<00:04:29.990> which<00:04:30.620> um<00:04:30.889> he

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
actually has the Avalanche which um he

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.610 
actually has the Avalanche which um he
actually<00:04:31.699> did<00:04:32.060> not<00:04:32.090> know<00:04:32.479> regice<00:04:33.169> could<00:04:33.439> learn

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
actually did not know regice could learn

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.350 
actually did not know regice could learn
a<00:04:33.650> nice<00:04:33.800> punch<00:04:34.069> that's<00:04:34.400> why<00:04:34.580> he<00:04:34.759> has<00:04:34.879> avalanche

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
a nice punch that's why he has avalanche

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.809 
a nice punch that's why he has avalanche
on<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.659> so<00:04:36.529> it's<00:04:36.680> kind<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:36.949> like<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.159> Miss<00:04:37.550> sad

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819

on it so it's kind of like a Miss sad
right<00:04:38.060> there<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.240> guess<00:04:38.449> you<00:04:38.539> could<00:04:38.689> say<00:04:38.810> but

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
right there I guess you could say but

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.959 
right there I guess you could say but

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
anyways this actually works out for me

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.600 
anyways this actually works out for me
better<00:04:41.300> since<00:04:42.259> considering<00:04:43.099> how<00:04:43.189> much<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.430> did

I can easily set up my second letter
toxic<00:04:45.469> spikes<00:04:45.740> then<00:04:46.639> as<00:04:46.939> soon<00:04:47.060> as<00:04:47.210> he<00:04:47.270> goes<00:04:47.419> for

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
toxic spikes then as soon as he goes for

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.300 
toxic spikes then as soon as he goes for
this<00:04:47.629> Avalanche<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.199> can<00:04:48.349> set<00:04:48.590> up<00:04:48.710> myself<00:04:48.919> rocks

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
this Avalanche I can set up myself rocks

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.550 
this Avalanche I can set up myself rocks
next<00:04:49.610> turn<00:04:49.879> so<00:04:50.509> I<00:04:50.539> can<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.870> my<00:04:50.990> complete<00:04:51.259> set

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.010 
next turn so I can have my complete set
up<00:04:51.759> so<00:04:52.759> everything<00:04:53.180> go<00:04:53.389> according<00:04:53.509> to<00:04:53.779> plan

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
him out this will actually make killing

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.059 
him out this will actually make killing
the<00:04:57.860> Pokemon<00:04:58.219> a<00:04:58.430> lot<00:04:58.849> easier<00:04:59.740> so<00:05:00.740> yeah<00:05:00.860> there<00:05:01.039> I

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
the Pokemon a lot easier so yeah there I

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.350 
the Pokemon a lot easier so yeah there I
went<00:05:01.219> for<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.490> stop<00:05:01.669> Rock<00:05:01.849> said<00:05:02.060> he<00:05:02.180> just

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
went for the stop Rock said he just

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.420 
went for the stop Rock said he just
keeps<00:05:03.020> going<00:05:03.169> for<00:05:03.409> avalanche<00:05:03.800> because<00:05:04.129> he<00:05:04.250> has

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
keeps going for avalanche because he has

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.219 
keeps going for avalanche because he has
nothing<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:04.939> hit<00:05:05.150> me<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.539> guess<00:05:05.900> he<00:05:06.020> was<00:05:06.199> just

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
nothing to hit me I guess he was just

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.579 
nothing to hit me I guess he was just
hoping<00:05:06.590> for<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.860> quick<00:05:07.069> and<00:05:07.960> since<00:05:08.960> toxic<00:05:09.469> is

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:09.589 
hoping for a quick and since toxic is

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:11.740 
hoping for a quick and since toxic is
racking<00:05:09.919> up<00:05:10.009> damage<00:05:10.339> on<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.639> I<00:05:10.759> can<00:05:11.240> easily

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
racking up damage on it I can easily

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.600 
racking up damage on it I can easily
kill<00:05:12.229> this<00:05:12.319> off<00:05:12.529> with<00:05:12.860> our<00:05:12.889> earthquake<00:05:13.219> if

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
kill this off with our earthquake if

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.420 
kill this off with our earthquake if
toxic<00:05:14.120> does<00:05:14.300> not<00:05:14.479> which<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:15.229> doesn't<00:05:15.469> saw<00:05:15.830> so

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
toxic does not which it doesn't saw so

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.459 
toxic does not which it doesn't saw so
like<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.669> said<00:05:16.729> I<00:05:16.849> cover<00:05:17.150> off<00:05:17.330> with<00:05:18.259> the

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
like I said I cover off with the

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.269 
like I said I cover off with the
earthquake<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:20.120> yeah<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.330> think<00:05:20.979> I'm<00:05:21.979> actually

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
and here I was so close to kicking bulk

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.629 
and here I was so close to kicking bulk
up<00:06:14.719> just<00:06:15.439> so<00:06:15.620> my<00:06:15.800> mock<00:06:16.099> punch<00:06:16.339> could<00:06:16.490> do<00:06:16.580> a

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
up just so my mock punch could do a

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.240 
up just so my mock punch could do a
little<00:06:16.879> bit<00:06:17.029> more<00:06:17.180> damage<00:06:17.629> but<00:06:18.529> again<00:06:18.949> I<00:06:18.979> just

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
little bit more damage but again I just

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.589 
little bit more damage but again I just
took<00:06:19.370> a<00:06:19.460> chance<00:06:19.699> I<00:06:19.819> just<00:06:20.000> wanted<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.270> play<00:06:20.419> it

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
took a chance I just wanted to play it

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.719 
took a chance I just wanted to play it
safe<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.020> see<00:06:21.199> how<00:06:21.289> much<00:06:21.469> it<00:06:21.589> would<00:06:21.680> do<00:06:21.889> and<00:06:22.129> it

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
safe and see how much it would do and it

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.719 
safe and see how much it would do and it
really<00:06:23.149> does<00:06:23.509> not<00:06:23.899> even<00:06:24.620> do<00:06:24.860> half<00:06:25.129> which<00:06:25.519> I<00:06:25.610> was

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
really does not even do half which I was

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.279
