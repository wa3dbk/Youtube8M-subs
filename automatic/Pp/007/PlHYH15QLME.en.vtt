00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
when I was lice in them and yes where

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.280 
when I was lice in them and yes where
I'm<00:03:14.549> up<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.329> going<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.720> go<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.079> bit

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
I'm up to it's going to go a little bit

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.750 
I'm up to it's going to go a little bit
higher<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.829> then<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:18.030> done<00:03:19.700> probably<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
higher and then it's done probably the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.039 
higher and then it's done probably the
same<00:03:20.790> height<00:03:21.060> as<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.329> building<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.840> think

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
same height as that building I think

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.380 
same height as that building I think
we're<00:03:22.170> getting<00:03:22.530> there<00:03:22.799> or<00:03:23.459> vary<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.030> higher

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
we're getting there or vary a bit higher
