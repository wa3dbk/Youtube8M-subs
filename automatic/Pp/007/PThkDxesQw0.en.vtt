00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.799
 montage video of a mountain bike with 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.960
 disc brakes 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.490
 we will join us on the internet tomorrow 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.099
 disc brake and bought up on the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 cover brings you so it stands in front of him now 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.620
 I show you how to bike this 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 Reasonable to assemble 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.480
 schneider says first 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:27.199
 the cable tie lions with which the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 Parts are attached to the front wheel 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.320
 transport packaging we dispose of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 can do the same, too 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 plastic disc to protect the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.000
 Brake can it can be anything easy 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 disposed of 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.040
 now solve but quick release 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040
 the front wheel 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.870
 and put this purely open the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.570
 quickly after and put the side with 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.110
 the wing on the disc brake side 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.800
 and put on the other side of the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.800
 mother easily 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.150
 Now we are allowed to do the pedals 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.119
 from the saddle put this on the side now 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.780
 we recommend the transport lock 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.080
 the fork and the racing saddle and 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 put the front wheel and in the fork 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.200
 on 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.289
 then we pull the quick release 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.350
 far as that are when folding the 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.410
 on a noticeable resistance 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 felt 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.600
 then we'll see if the wheel is free 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.340
 if that is not the case we have to 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.710
 just set the brake quickly 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.710
 For this we always need in 5 mm 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 key the two screws 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 at the caliper 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.180
 so that it can move freely 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.560
 then we pull the brake hold the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.860
 Screw pulled fog love ten 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.860
 back to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.890
 After that , the free country will take care of us 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.989
 us around the pedals 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.209
 Please note that we have one 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.379
 left and one right pedal have the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.090
 left pedal is with a l 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.750
 marked just with a m 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.750
 start with the left pedals and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.670
 turn these on the left side against 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.670
 clockwise in the Kurverein 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.040
 then we need a 15 normal 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.230
 Wrench and pull these pedals 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.940
 right now we take the right one 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.040
 pedals 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.760
 turn clockwise in the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.760
 right ball 1 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.280
 and also this with the 15 of the key 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.280
 tighten again 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.939
 Now I have to take the wheel down 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.540
 so that I think the handlebar reasonable 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.540
 can adjust 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.129
 Now we need an allen key 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.900
 turn the stem straight pull the 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.900
 Clamp screws evenly 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.860
 Then we turn the handlebars 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.560
 stand brake then look suitable 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.660
 We think that the handlebar is even in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.280
 the clamp sits in the front and pull 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.280
 These screws also evenly 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.010
 then it is about driving fun with her new 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.010
 mountain bike in the way
