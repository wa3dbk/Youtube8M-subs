00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.959
 Hello here is pc games on tour 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.720
 Today our station Edmonton in Canada 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.699
 because there is not completely unknown 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 development studio called at him 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 Home working on dragon age 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.579
 Inclusion that we were able to rest 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.860
 play and have the opportunity 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.730
 we also with some creative im 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.730
 interview talked 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.020
 What we do in open world gameplay 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.060
 you want to achieve a goal be it 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.710
 a story task or something that one 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.970
 has set itself as something 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.530
 certain forces 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.440
 but then that's what you're trying to do 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.790
 that's about as much as I am going to distract 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 go about this mission 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.360
 complete 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.800
 wait a minute because I can do something for 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.690
 collect crafts and there is one 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.070
 treasure chest that throughout 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.590
 and what did I want right away 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.270
 many of the things we talk about jump over 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.830
 have learned the gameplay on the world 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.509
 is about this distraction 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.110
 we give these little opportunities 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.210
 offer you the feeling that you 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.570
 a larger force at the moment than 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.610
 only your party therefore there are spies 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.550
 or ambassadors are these characters 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.810
 part of your support network 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.729
 after you make a new one in the wilderness 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.500
 camps have settled there 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.390
 soldiers to protect it 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.740
 an enlightener does not bring one with him 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.600
 information about the region and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.789
 mission or other things 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.770
 which of the inquisition has an advantage 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.090
 then you can even see 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.830
 Soldiers along the street 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.390
 patrols that help you when you're in 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.550
 your closeness in a fight low 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.590
 one of my favorite events ever 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.119
 the more stock you have in a region the more 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.830
 higher is the probability that 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.209
 sometimes soldiers with a treasure chest 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.429
 appear and tell you good ones 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.840
 news we are out of the public 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.990
 found some resources 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.119
 if you guys they belong to you volt 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.580
 i feel like wow thanks guys you 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.170
 Be really helpful the end result 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.640
 that your inquisition not only 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 like an organization on paper 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.770
 she has a presence in the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.870
 physical is definitely so far 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.489
 biggest dragon age plays the most 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.280
 his theaters are fairer in the 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.680
 or a euro store we visit because 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.870
 young and go out to the west great 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.060
 where once the second corruption from the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.040
 there was a deep laying in ferelden 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.170
 moor but also ideological areas 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.510
 through the mountains it goes into the days of 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.130
 Elves what a flatland he is 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.270
 visit a lot of different region 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.069
 and environment like them 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.220
 that makes us very distinctive visual 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.320
 have experiences 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.090
 if you like a scorching desert 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.920
 snowy mountains then change 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.960
 It looks completely different from feeling completely different 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.970
 different to the noise changes 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.710
 if you have enough of one area 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.660
 time again to your home base 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.430
 return to cairo to recover 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.290
 with your people should chat 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.210
 such things stop if you then something 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.060
 you can change yourself 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.770
 Whether your headquarters wedge 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.900
 picks up a similar role as the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.790
 standards the mass effect and still works 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.890
 a little further it is a place of 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.350
 the progress of changes in 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.520
 The action here but affect 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.740
 you also meet very specific 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.480
 Decisions itself it is a place of 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.459
 now customize you can add your stamp 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.500
 you can put on the tapestries 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.060
 change or replace the banner you 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.380
 Can collect carvings and here 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.050
 build a wall 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.209
 I'm currently playing an eleven character 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.950
 and the ovens are all English 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.959
 I have the facility fully danish 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.910
 the people styled that for me 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:52.940
 disturbing work only pitch I had 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:54.590
 on the frostbite engine meant for 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.940
 a lot of work the best for us 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.160
 description that I have heard so far 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.989
 It's like a Formula One racing car 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.190
 if you just try to go with him like that 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.560
 to drive then you probably get 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.060
 in a lamppost but only too 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.430
 amazing things in a position 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.930
 and so it is in the principle also with 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.120
 the frostbite engine you have to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.190
 Be aware that the performance 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.769
 strong but dangerous is really for that 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.900
 very powerful in the creation 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.340
 try this great mirror 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.650
 We use the story as a heart of the story 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.150
 dragon age experience to preserve it 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.190
 should always be for you as an inquisitor 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.380
 that feels like you because of these places 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.060
 certain goals you visit 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.860
 example, the moor on sus then not 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.390
 just white just stops there and you 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.280
 go there because some of your men 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.020
 Missing there so it feels so 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.940
 always so that you as inquisitor 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.040
 your area of ​​action expanded and 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:50.240
 opportunity after you go to 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:52.220
 one of the big areas definitely has 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.910
 the most complex craft system we have 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.410
 ever done 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.420
 the production of potions is increased 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.220
 Recipes are improved you are looking for 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.350
 new cure or regeneration 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.100
 drink and collect the ingredients around these 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.630
 to master 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.060
 the manufacture of weapons and 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.590
 armor parts runs a little differently so 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.720
 For example, consider the construction plan for one 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.490
 sword at the seven metal parts for 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.530
 the blade and 3 or pieces for the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.240
 handle will need which special 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.550
 metal and what special leather but 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.430
 Use determines the values ​​of it 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.600
 resulting sword the blueprint gives 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.550
 Molds and patterns before 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 but the exact values ​​result 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.660
 the materials chosen by you 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:35.670
 you can also dye it 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:37.320
 so that it looks exactly like one 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.660
 fighting system is my personal style 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.610
 often a mixture of near and far fight 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.080
 if i want to play the tank games i will crash 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.550
 happy with a storm attack into 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.610
 done because that feels very much 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.230
 Satisfactory if it's just a two-opponent 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.970
 or they are below my level 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.380
 then I play in real time 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.730
 Archer can through the talents 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.910
 to deal bonus damage 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.650
 if he is positioned high I use 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.270
 on the tactical camera around him on one 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.130
 send and can raise me 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.830
 be sure he finds out and 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.540
 from there shoots after such 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.310
 positioning commands have given 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.510
 I'll do it in real time 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.340
 spend much more time with the 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.290
 tactical camera at hard opponents like 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.220
 kite or if I'm on a higher level 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.220
 difficulty game
