00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.060
 Y 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.010
 Hi, I'm again today, make them up 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.719
 super simple and basic for when 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.099
 you are beginning to put on makeup you are the 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.950
 girl who are just having 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.320
 make up I consider it that way of law 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.340
 classic that you have to know this 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.050
 way of machine and with this makeup 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.550
 what we are looking for is to take care of you 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.160
 skin right now you do not want to look 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.190
 problems or anything like that because your skin 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.660
 is the young woman who will have about 11 12 13 14 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.190
 or the typical baixa de consolas de play 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.070
 because they already tell you they can make up and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.510
 you are going to make up here, I do not think 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.860
 be ideal because the only thing you're going to 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.460
 do is find your problems for your 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.890
 skin you 're going to bring acne with that and there's 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.390
 many things that I stop for you 4 and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.460
 because I tell you because it's what me 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.140
 it happened to me and they told me that you can 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.630
 make up and I ran as well as I 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 they removed the gate and I ran to buy 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.000
 how much 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.700
 and the only thing I did was provoke 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.700
 problems in the skin that had dark circles and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.110
 here was another color 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.940
 thing that I'm struggling with for years and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.820
 until now that my skin is more or less 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.520
 grew calmed down they called how it's going to be 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.650
 and that problem is over but if 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 it's a program I brought it I did not occupy 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 nothing base and what I did was to see what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.280
 it feels to base yourself and I based myself on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.640
 miami afterwards and things that I already told you 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 well with this look we are going to make you 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.860
 You see how arranged but not noticed 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.900
 so much that you custard because I tell you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.869
 because the girls start to put on makeup 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.729
 like in high school and I remember that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
 my high school when I get to the perfect 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 friend you painted and not in the end paint and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.110
 arrives punts and so with paper here look 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.060
 so you painted yourself go clean the bathroom and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.520
 feet and with which I would report I do not know what 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.440
 so lukewarm and like not to hate me not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.240
 I want that for myself for that reason seeing 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.460
 I painted myself and I began to paint until 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.320
 well already stuffed I started to understand 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.600
 how you are entering high school as usual 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.040
 the 15 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.020
 14 15 well then already without so much roll 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.760
 I'll talk now what makeup 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.540
 that we occupy we are going to occupy one that already 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.950
 that mine this is powder I consider 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.800
 which is the finest thing you can put on 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.750
 right now on your face why because of 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.850
 by itself is already very tender and here your face 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.100
 and you do not want to put it so many layers 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.110
 above but simply cover the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.690
 suggested slight ones that have to have and the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 shine if you suffer from acne or something 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.670
 already on its own it looks for a base that 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.010
 go according to your needs is 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.630
 for example there is the vein of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.730
 maybelline that we had still the band 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.380
 It helped me a lot, it's a platform 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.630
 it has chamomile and it does not do that as 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.700
 call to lay the fourth to not be 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.070
 call I'm going to put it out there but that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.350
 base is very good light capable agreement 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.660
 your acne needs and what do you 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.950
 cover the basics you're not going to look for each 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.930
 a 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.100
 a base that is not your age by large 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.950
 I say it's going to be this part of the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.860
 pores and bring you problems if we do that 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.970
 there are several phases that are for young people 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.990
 just like you or me like me and they're going to 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.210
 help a lot when 'the lady' 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.490
 considered very good if you know how to choose your 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.800
 color is going pretty well is the mine already what 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.200
 I said in a mineral power is pretty 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.610
 good to occupy a many brush 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.440
 Sometimes the brush comes with the mining company 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.880
 power and with that same brush you can 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.440
 put the blog also not really 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.780
 we occupy the great thing because for this 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.840
 occupies look no big deal and is are 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.450
 basic things 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.840
 the brush 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.760
 the blog these nights that are rosita that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.060
 barely if you see the beautiful organ to me 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 they love the best 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.310
 a balm for a color over in china 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.860
 that is also the law that you already have 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.220
 what to have if you are going to start a 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.220
 makeup collection 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.520
 a mascara a mascara 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.579
 we consider it good because then as 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.590
 you do not look for dark circles either, I suppose 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.389
 It is good to wait for tours for people 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.580
 that in the eyelashes so do not do 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.840
 the sprinkler down here that also for 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.430
 we're going to see it for ore 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.009
 put it here under your eyes and you do not know 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.479
 water you nothing let's start this 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.270
 makeup that is so simple so 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.250
 fast and ideal almost almost for how you 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.199
 you start to make up to start a 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.060
 gradual way no or you will not get there 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.560
 a day without makeup the next day all the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.139
 russia is going to look like I want 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.330
 that's what we're looking good 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.940
 let's start by applying the powder 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.270
 mineral care first is to get off and 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.550
 then you open it you take the dust of the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.240
 because it is a powder as I said very 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.400
 fine thin enough you take the brush and what 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.820
 irrigated by everything will touch including 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.620
 circles to cover this part of the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.479
 look and that after you're watered 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.479
 mascara 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.150
 the next thing is to curl your lashes let's go 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.000
 to start at the root after 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.860
 we press again we go to means to 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.550
 finish at the tips by raising towards 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.620
 above 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.800
 we do not want your tabs to look like 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.350
 a squad without form but you see 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.710
 with a natural inclined right away 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.140
 let's apply the mascara and 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.450
 I told you to put a guard of 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.370
 products around here like I got stirred up and 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.370
 then use the natural yemen 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.470
 well as you see the mascara 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.450
 always applied in the middle of a zigzag 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.950
 they go from the root to the tip what will 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.950
 that do not form so many lumps 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.419
 well as you come, I finished with the two 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.119
 eyes and it looks quite different the 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.279
 look now let's go with the blog I'm going to 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.830
 apply in quick movements in the 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:10.069
 top of my cheeks as you see 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.569
 it does not look that stressed so I'm going to apply 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.720
 also on the nose and on the chin 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:17.360
 to make it look more natural 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.850
 at once and finally the balm goes 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.390
 for lips this to have lips 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.980
 hydrated and not go unnoticed 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.380
 ingenuity to dry and as you see then it is not the 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.720
 great makeup thing I say they look 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.550
 if they are my eyelashes and if your case 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.100
 is the same as the one they put you 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.900
 replenish the report you make up or so and 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.060
 thought that instead of getting edward 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.650
 product put a simple one simple 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.600
 transparent eyelash mask is that 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.030
 are for the dry so that your lashes 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.920
 stay that way and I think that 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.420
 It is best suited for that right now 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.580
 who are you starting to make up is 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.530
 as the basis of all this makeup is 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:58.970
 the basis of everything and take great care of your skin 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.680
 I noticed you as it is said do not speed up 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.960
 buy so many things or have more 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.720
 simply what is necessary right now for your 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.690
 skin and so you can see or be pretty without 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.150
 have to overload so much that is is the 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.810
 makeup key do a lot with 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.430
 little bit 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.200
 always I thought so and I guess 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.410
 many people also think so and 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.090
 agreement with that ideology and then here 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.740
 I hope you liked the look 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.360
 any doubt you know 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.550
 or any other you have in mind 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.180
 tell me here is in the comments and 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.180
 until next time
