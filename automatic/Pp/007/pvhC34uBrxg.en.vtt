00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.889
 for a new unpacking video and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.839
 of presentation and I will be interested 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.970
 a little bit to the cooler master mouse 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.980
 cm storm is art who is the little sister 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
 from the storm havok cm that I had you 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 already presented in video 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.480
 then as usual we will start 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 to be interested in information that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.260
 are present on the packaging then 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 you have the opportunity to adjust to the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.140
 the-fly dpi mouse you have 7 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 programmable buttons via software and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.950
 anti-slip pad that on each side of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 the mouse that will allow a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 better grip 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 we have a laser sensor that does not prevent 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.320
 8200 countries is the same as on the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.969
 havok 1 to bago 9800 in the back you 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 have a focus on the different 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.780
 functions was mouse but I'm there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.510
 will come back a little bit to the contest of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.800
 videos then also one to the packaging that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.120
 is as usual very well done 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 with a little door that will be able 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.180
 open but that does not give us 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 much more information 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 extra so we'll be able to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 now look at what is present at 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 the inside of the box and the bundle has 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.070
 really been reduced to guts and strict 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.270
 minimum with just a small manual 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.030
 who will take back the information 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.220
 techniques and you give yourself one the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.270
 information in case of problem with the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.850
 mouse to see direct towards 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.650
 assistance and then down it's all 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 you do not have to give it away or neil dvd 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.659
 with the pilots you simply have the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 mouse that is provided so it will take that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.530
 you were going to download 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.630
 pilots on cooler master website 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.220
 so precisely to come back on this 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.200
 cable it's a totally 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.960
 classic usb gold plated 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.640
 but who is however gainer so it's going 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.509
 to make good enough that's fine 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.369
 return to your desk 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.020
 otherwise at the level of the mouse we are facing 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.430
 to a mouse that is smaller and more 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.850
 light that the lawyer she does only 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.470
 121 g so it's really very light me 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 I like light mice so that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.049
 it's going to depend on what you 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.820
 prefer 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.009
 we do not have a finish except maybe 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.540
 this time but except touchpoint it is 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 to say that it is rather a plastic 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.750
 smooth but who will still have a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.200
 touched lightly rescue so that's 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.910
 a little bit different salary a little 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.800
 little more low-end but the quality of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.819
 manufacturing remains excellent especially on 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.810
 this mouse 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.659
 I found the grip very 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 nice just with his two skates 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.269
 anti-slip on each side so no 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.709
 problem at this level there you can a 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.909
 little better to see them there is a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.769
 texture that is nice enough you 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.749
 touch you also see a little bit 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.840
 better the top where there is simply one 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:30.090
 just see the 6th logo 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.980
 storm like on the boc in the front you 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.599
 are going to have most of your pimples 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.730
 that will be grouped together and we can see 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.189
 also that it's a design that stays very 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.359
 sober and very classic that has no 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.669
 extravagant things 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.549
 you have the left click and the click 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.439
 right which are very it takes a click 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.849
 which is very nice to hear 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.980
 the wheel is quite precise and it has 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.189
 one on a surface that will allow a 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.810
 a good grip and buttons 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.159
 you wanted those two little buttons there 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.709
 that will allow switching between 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.090
 different profiles and each profile is going 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.340
 allow will change the color of the logo 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.500
 like that you can assign a 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.269
 color to each of your profiles and a 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.280
 profile corresponds to a level of spite 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.889
 that I show you with the software you 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.259
 have the taste of pimples so that basic 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.609
 will go back next next to the back 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:21.180
 you can revisit a little bit the 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.129
 avago 9800 sensor that's here and four 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.299
 little skates that are in my opinion 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.879
 just a bit too small 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.909
 unlike the huge skate that 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.620
 had on the voc but good if not the 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.079
 mouse tri slides very very much of course the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.069
 desktop at the software level to finish 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.540
 we will now watch what we want 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.639
 do so of course you can 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.319
 assign each key a function 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.760
 different from the one who signed by 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.959
 defect and 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.470
 I configure is independently 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.760
 independently the four profiles 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.470
 so that's pretty well done you 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.750
 can adjust the dpi is full of 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.680
 little things define macros then 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.230
 even if there are not many buttons 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.209
 you can set bench macros for 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.530
 the middle click of the mouse you 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.599
 will be able to make game profiles 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.860
 you are going to have a library 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.069
 to import and export 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 different settings that you have 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.239
 realized and a link back to 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.370
 the audience so here I think we have 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.319
 pretty much walked around this mouse 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.000
 cm storm weird thank you 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.530
 have watched this video and feel free to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.530
 not to subscribe to the chain
