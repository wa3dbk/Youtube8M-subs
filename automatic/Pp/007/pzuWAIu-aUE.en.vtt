00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
to be doing an iphone 4 on the left and

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.990 
to be doing an iphone 4 on the left and
4s<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.200> right<00:00:07.350> geekbench<00:00:08.099> test<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:08.730> we're

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
4s on the right geekbench test but we're

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.299 
4s on the right geekbench test but we're
also<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> be<00:00:09.480> doing<00:00:09.599> ipad<00:00:10.110> 1<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.590> ipad<00:00:11.160> 2

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
also going to be doing ipad 1 and ipad 2

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.610 
also going to be doing ipad 1 and ipad 2
a<00:00:11.340> little<00:00:11.670> later<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.540> plenty<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> geekbench

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
a little later on so plenty of geekbench

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
a little later on so plenty of geekbench

benchmark<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:13.040> I'm<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.369> them

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
benchmark and I'm going to do them

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
benchmark and I'm going to do them
without<00:01:15.000> skipping<00:01:15.630> ahead<00:01:15.810> because<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
without skipping ahead because I want to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
without skipping ahead because I want to
see<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.920> want<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.369> guys<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> span<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
see I want you guys to see the span of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.560 
see I want you guys to see the span of
time<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.780> both<00:01:18.960> take<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.619> run<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> test<00:01:20.280> as

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
time they both take to run the test as

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
time they both take to run the test as
you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.080> iphone<00:01:22.380> 4<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.009> about

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you can see the iphone 4 is about

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.940 
you can see the iphone 4 is about
halfway<00:01:23.820> done<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.380> four<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
halfway done right now and the four is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.200 
halfway done right now and the four is
you<00:01:26.909> know<00:01:27.000> slightly<00:01:27.299> behind<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> 4s<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you know slightly behind and the 4s is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
you know slightly behind and the 4s is
done<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> score<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> 6<00:01:31.470> 23<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
done with the score of 6 23 which is you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090

360 and this got a 640 so let's go ahead
and<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.320> ipad<00:02:19.650> test<00:02:20.510> alright<00:02:21.510> guys<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.050> as

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
and do that ipad test alright guys so as

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.810 
and do that ipad test alright guys so as
you<00:02:22.350> can<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> ipad<00:02:22.890> one<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.580> left

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you can see the ipad one is on the left

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.430 
you can see the ipad one is on the left
the<00:02:24.030> ipad<00:02:24.330> 2<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> right<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
the ipad 2 is on the right this is the

just<00:03:01.709> want<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> quickly<00:03:02.220> show<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.880> they

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
just want to quickly show you that they

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.310 
just want to quickly show you that they
both<00:03:03.209> have<00:03:03.510> nothing<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:03.989> on<00:03:04.170> in

both have nothing going on in

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.650 
both have nothing going on in
multitasking<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.180> obviously<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:06.360> just

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
multitasking and obviously that's just

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.790

the<00:03:07.400> control<00:03:08.400> bar<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.230> let's<00:03:10.530> run<00:03:10.709> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
the control bar and so let's run the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.740 
the control bar and so let's run the
test<00:03:11.010> at<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.190> same<00:03:11.370> time<00:03:13.550> so<00:03:14.550> here<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.880> go<00:03:14.910> I'm

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
test at the same time so here we go I'm

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.060 
test at the same time so here we go I'm
just<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.380> talk<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.830> while<00:03:16.950> this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
just going to talk to you while this

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.759 
just going to talk to you while this
happens<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:18.330> don't<00:03:19.019> want<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> miss

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the speeds that they are running them so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.590 
the speeds that they are running them so
