yeah<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> moment<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.330> uh<00:01:10.310> turning

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
yeah at the moment I'm just uh turning

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
yeah at the moment I'm just uh turning
off<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> autopilot<00:01:11.900> putting<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
off the autopilot putting down the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.020 
off the autopilot putting down the
landing<00:01:13.619> gear<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> come<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> nice

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
landing gear to come in for a nice

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.280 
landing gear to come in for a nice
landing<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.270> reason<00:01:18.570> why<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.840> always<00:01:19.020> on

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
landing and the reason why I'm always on

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.710 
landing and the reason why I'm always on
outside<00:01:19.799> lock<00:01:20.100> spot<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
outside lock spot it's because this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
outside lock spot it's because this
model<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> a330<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.939> doesn't<00:01:24.180> show

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
model the a330 right here doesn't show

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
model the a330 right here doesn't show
virtual<00:01:24.990> cockpit<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.430> preferred

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
virtual cockpit and that's my preferred

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.200 
virtual cockpit and that's my preferred
um<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.080> land<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> most

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
um you to land because I get the most

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
um you to land because I get the most

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.029 
actually quite bad with this and as you
can<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:09.810> even<00:02:10.229> hit<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> fresh<00:02:10.770> hold

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
can see I don't even hit the fresh hold

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.590 
can see I don't even hit the fresh hold
of<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> room<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:11.849> am<00:02:12.500> stall

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
of the room I actually am stall

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.230 
of the room I actually am stall
before<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.080> get<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> water<00:02:14.770> now<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.970> you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
before I get to the water now if you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.500 
before I get to the water now if you
notice<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.370> engine<00:02:18.820> edge<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
notice just on the engine edge of the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.420 
notice just on the engine edge of the
winglets<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:20.230> are<00:02:20.410> some<00:02:20.650> white<00:02:20.860> streams

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
winglets there are some white streams

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.560 
winglets there are some white streams
they're<00:02:21.730> gone<00:02:22.030> now

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
they're gone now

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.170 
they're gone now
but<00:02:23.440> basically<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.250> looking<00:02:24.610> for<00:02:24.820> them<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
but basically I was looking for them and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.910 
but basically I was looking for them and
if<00:02:25.270> they<00:02:25.450> weren't<00:02:25.660> there<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.260> knew<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.680> was

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
if they weren't there I was I knew I was

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
if they weren't there I was I knew I was
going<00:02:27.100> too<00:02:27.280> slow<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:27.990> basically<00:02:28.990> at<00:02:29.170> this

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
going too slow so basically at this

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.580 
going too slow so basically at this
point<00:02:29.380> on<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.980> knew<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> was<00:02:30.580> screwed<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.230> went

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
point on I knew I was screwed so I went

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.200 
point on I knew I was screwed so I went
and<00:02:33.450> tried<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.750> stop<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:36.210> quickly

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
and tried to stop it so I just quickly

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.130 
and tried to stop it so I just quickly
turned<00:02:38.020> off<00:02:38.200> all<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> thrust<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:43.110> actually<00:02:44.110> I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
turned off all the thrust and actually I

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020 
turned off all the thrust and actually I
didn't<00:02:44.530> turn<00:02:44.680> off<00:02:44.740> all<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.190> thrust<00:02:45.460> put<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.940> to

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
didn't turn off all the thrust put it to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.570 
didn't turn off all the thrust put it to
171<00:02:46.660> knots

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
171 knots

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.770 
171 knots
unfortunately<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.760> could<00:02:49.000> not<00:02:49.180> cut<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.600> and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
unfortunately that could not cut it and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.870 
unfortunately that could not cut it and
keep<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.350> mind<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.650> was<00:02:50.830> my<00:02:51.040> first<00:02:51.280> landing

with a 330 that um my first try to land
with<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.100> 330<00:02:58.950> yeah<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.130> didn't<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:00.730> work

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
with a 330 yeah it didn't really work

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.000

something so go back to copy it change
the<00:03:11.380> speed<00:03:11.740> down<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.310> very<00:03:12.550> low<00:03:13.980> speed<00:03:14.980> as

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the speed down to a very low speed as

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.130 
the speed down to a very low speed as
you<00:03:15.460> can<00:03:15.640> see<00:03:15.790> I'll<00:03:15.940> just<00:03:16.090> change<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.510> down<00:03:16.810> I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
changed it to 130 which was a bad idea

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
too fast I tried to flare the aircraft

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.370 
too fast I tried to flare the aircraft
before<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.380> runway<00:03:29.590> like<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.100> crj700<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:32.260> as

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
before the runway like the crj700 but as

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.340 
before the runway like the crj700 but as

okay I'm just gonna check something
quickly<00:04:29.600> all<00:04:30.290> right<00:04:30.440> cool<00:04:30.680> it's<00:04:30.860> been

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
quickly all right cool it's been

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.220 
quickly all right cool it's been
recording<00:04:31.490> my<00:04:31.640> voice<00:04:31.850> so<00:04:32.210> we<00:04:32.390> can<00:04:32.570> continue

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
recording my voice so we can continue

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.450 
recording my voice so we can continue
all<00:04:34.190> right<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.490> it's<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.640> hundred<00:04:34.880> percent<00:04:35.270> now

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
all right so it's a hundred percent now

all right so it's a hundred percent now
as<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.640> can<00:04:37.790> see<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.090> aircraft<00:04:38.450> is<00:04:38.600> aquinas

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
as you can see the aircraft is aquinas

yeah<00:04:43.690> what<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.720> did<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.200> make<00:04:45.380> sure<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:45.770> good<00:04:46.540> I

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.310 

can<00:04:50.780> play<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.290> am<00:04:51.370> turn<00:04:52.370> on<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.990> fire<00:04:53.990> thing

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
can play I am turn on the fire thing

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.080 
can play I am turn on the fire thing
again<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:54.860> I<00:04:54.890> don't<00:04:54.950> have<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.280> burning<00:04:55.730> engine

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
again so I don't have a burning engine

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.770 
again so I don't have a burning engine
when<00:04:56.480> I<00:04:56.600> land<00:04:57.970> then<00:04:59.170> put<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:01.600> things<00:05:02.600> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
when I land then put the things the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.330 
when I land then put the things the
armed<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:03.350> spoilers<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.340> armed<00:05:04.700> so<00:05:06.340> right

there yep and go outside to lock spot

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.760 
there yep and go outside to lock spot
because<00:05:11.300> normal<00:05:11.750> child<00:05:11.990> doesn't<00:05:12.230> work<00:05:12.500> so

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
so and then I change the speed to a

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.410 
so and then I change the speed to a
higher<00:05:17.810> speed<00:05:18.260> maybe<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.890> try<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.700> avoid

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
higher speed maybe to try and avoid

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.330 
higher speed maybe to try and avoid
getting<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.380> so<00:05:21.590> there's<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.890> aircraft

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
getting that so there's the aircraft

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
like to give it a little bit more lift

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.760 
like to give it a little bit more lift
to<00:05:55.250> get<00:05:55.460> rid<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.700> its<00:05:55.880> speed<00:05:56.180> I<00:05:56.620> push<00:05:57.620> the

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
to get rid of its speed I push the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.560 
to get rid of its speed I push the
aircraft's<00:05:58.310> nose<00:05:58.340> down<00:05:58.790> pull<00:05:59.060> it<00:05:59.180> back<00:05:59.360> up

just for a quick just to put it back up
in<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.370> air

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
in the air

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.070 
in the air
remember<00:06:05.000> this<00:06:05.120> isn't<00:06:05.330> on<00:06:05.570> autopilot<00:06:07.900> so<00:06:08.900> now

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
remember this isn't on autopilot so now

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.870 
remember this isn't on autopilot so now
I'm<00:06:09.200> just<00:06:09.380> pushing<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.860> nose<00:06:10.070> down<00:06:10.370> of<00:06:10.670> the

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
I'm just pushing the nose down of the

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.810 
I'm just pushing the nose down of the
aircraft<00:06:11.270> and<00:06:12.050> I<00:06:12.110> pull<00:06:12.380> it<00:06:12.530> up<00:06:12.620> now<00:06:12.860> just<00:06:13.130> it's

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
aircraft and I pull it up now just it's

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.080 
aircraft and I pull it up now just it's
a<00:06:13.880> pretty<00:06:14.480> bad<00:06:14.950> descent<00:06:15.950> I<00:06:16.190> reckon<00:06:16.970> the

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
a pretty bad descent I reckon the

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.860 
a pretty bad descent I reckon the
landing<00:06:17.510> it's<00:06:17.660> the<00:06:17.750> best<00:06:17.990> part<00:06:18.260> so<00:06:19.390> now<00:06:20.390> by<00:06:20.660> now

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
landing it's the best part so now by now

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.480 
landing it's the best part so now by now
I<00:06:20.900> know<00:06:21.080> I<00:06:21.200> this<00:06:21.410> is<00:06:21.770> going<00:06:21.920> to<00:06:22.070> be<00:06:22.190> a<00:06:22.220> pretty

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
I know I this is going to be a pretty

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.490 
I know I this is going to be a pretty

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
not to stall the threshold of the runway

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.100 
not to stall the threshold of the runway

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.730 
and yeah I'm pulling the nose up trying
to<00:06:34.790> keep<00:06:35.060> it<00:06:35.270> stable

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
to keep it stable

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
far my best landing so right here I turn

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.420 
far my best landing so right here I turn
off<00:07:11.039> auto<00:07:11.310> thrust<00:07:11.759> and<00:07:12.800> pulled<00:07:13.800> the<00:07:14.039> engines

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
off auto thrust and pulled the engines

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.430 
off auto thrust and pulled the engines
back<00:07:14.639> to<00:07:14.789> reverse<00:07:15.150> put<00:07:15.599> the<00:07:15.720> spoilers<00:07:16.169> down

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
I am tarmac of Princess Juliana I guess

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.700

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.260 
it's my best landing of the a330 200 as
you<00:07:25.830> can<00:07:26.009> see<00:07:26.250> I'm<00:07:26.400> just<00:07:26.610> straightening<00:07:26.940> up

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
you can see I'm just straightening up

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.890 
you can see I'm just straightening up
the<00:07:27.300> aircraft<00:07:27.840> as<00:07:28.139> we<00:07:28.349> finish<00:07:29.009> up<00:07:29.159> and<00:07:29.900> yeah

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
the aircraft as we finish up and yeah

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.719 
the aircraft as we finish up and yeah
that's<00:07:31.110> pretty<00:07:31.169> much<00:07:31.380> it<00:07:31.830> and<00:07:31.979> I<00:07:32.280> forgot<00:07:32.610> to

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729 
that's pretty much it and I forgot to

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.460 
that's pretty much it and I forgot to
turn<00:07:32.909> the<00:07:32.970> thrust<00:07:33.449> reversers<00:07:33.539> off<00:07:34.199> I<00:07:34.319> think

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
turn the thrust reversers off I think

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.230 
turn the thrust reversers off I think
that<00:07:34.680> was<00:07:34.830> the<00:07:34.979> only<00:07:35.039> problem<00:07:35.370> but<00:07:35.970> otherwise

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
that was the only problem but otherwise

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.059 
that was the only problem but otherwise
I'm<00:07:36.539> happy<00:07:36.780> with<00:07:36.900> the<00:07:37.050> landing<00:07:37.409> I<00:07:37.620> was<00:07:37.800> happy
