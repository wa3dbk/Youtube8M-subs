it does roll around a little bit more
but<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.840> still<00:00:49.020> dynamic<00:00:49.860> smooth<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
but it's still dynamic smooth and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hatchback and the cheapest model that's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.229 
hatchback and the cheapest model that's
a<00:01:00.059> 1.2<00:01:00.600> TSI<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.160> actually<00:01:02.309> 2<00:01:02.760> grand

less than the cheapest Golf Estate ok so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
less than the cheapest Golf Estate ok so
this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> obviously<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.409> business<00:01:07.860> end<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
this is obviously the business end of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.620 
this is obviously the business end of
the<00:01:08.430> lane<00:01:08.580> st<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.659> open<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
the lane st we open it up here there's a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.969 
the lane st we open it up here there's a
587<00:01:12.630> litre<00:01:12.930> boot<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:13.740> slightly

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
587 litre boot here now that's slightly

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
587 litre boot here now that's slightly
smaller<00:01:14.189> than<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> Golf<00:01:14.909> Estate<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
smaller than the Golf Estate and the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.870 
smaller than the Golf Estate and the
Octavia<00:01:16.229> estate<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> price<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
Octavia estate but that's the price you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630 
Octavia estate but that's the price you
pay<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.240> afraid<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.350> svelte<00:01:19.590> looks

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
pay I'm afraid for the more svelte looks

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
pay I'm afraid for the more svelte looks
there's<00:01:21.420> plenty<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.689> tricks<00:01:22.080> though<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
there's plenty more tricks though if you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.520 
there's plenty more tricks though if you
pull<00:01:22.799> these<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.159> handles<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:24.409> you'll<00:01:25.409> see

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
pull these two handles here you'll see

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
pull these two handles here you'll see
the<00:01:25.650> seats<00:01:25.890> flop<00:01:26.159> down<00:01:26.420> automatically<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the seats flop down automatically and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
the seats flop down automatically and
that<00:01:27.780> frees<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.259> fourteen<00:01:29.100> hundred<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.549> 70

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that frees up fourteen hundred and 70

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
that frees up fourteen hundred and 70
litres<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> space<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.229> even<00:01:31.500> fold<00:01:31.710> down

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
litres of space you can even fold down

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
litres of space you can even fold down
the<00:01:31.920> front<00:01:32.189> passenger<00:01:32.579> seat<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.299> lets<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the front passenger seat now lets you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.960 
the front passenger seat now lets you
put<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.259> long<00:01:34.439> objects<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
put in really long objects up to two and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
put in really long objects up to two and
a<00:01:36.000> half<00:01:36.180> metres<00:01:36.869> long<00:01:37.079> there's<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.310> well

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a half metres long there's more as well

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
a half metres long there's more as well
these<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.299> boot<00:01:39.509> floor<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
these this boot floor down here this is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
these this boot floor down here this is
at<00:01:40.860> its<00:01:41.009> lowest<00:01:41.220> setting<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> moment<00:01:42.689> but

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
at its lowest setting at the moment but

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.980 
at its lowest setting at the moment but
if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> pull<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> back<00:01:45.780> up

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
if you pull it out and put it back up

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.710 
if you pull it out and put it back up
there<00:01:46.020> well<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> creates<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.700> perfectly<00:01:48.450> flat

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
there well that creates a perfectly flat
