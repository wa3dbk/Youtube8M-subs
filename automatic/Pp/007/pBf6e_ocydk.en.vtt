00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.769
 for 

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:26.460
 I would be in good condition without getting involved 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.649
 Today we are off the 40gb product on Find Live 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.180
 070gb products are sake pcb 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 Unlike those products that receive the existing satellite 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 When there are many teams 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 Fairly fast at least 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.580
 Election law 250 trillion 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.180
 To avoid features, etc., 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.700
 . 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.600
 vos Park Jiheon 750gb products 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.489
 The dmb antenna is actually doing finegpx 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.920
 The function is not working. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.299
 What is the difference between the number of products and the rate at which they receive the satellite 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.299
 I will tell you whether or not 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.490
 Notice that the bill of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.210
 # 009900 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.370
 Regulatory, and so on. 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.080
 I'm receiving a gps date from now on. 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 Contribution confirmation is becoming 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 i 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 As you can see, 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.930
 We can confirm that there is no big difference in the number of satellites in terms of speed. 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 Will 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.540
 Again, I can stop the march. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.560
 It gives you the opportunity to create and edit 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 Not working 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.650
 As a strategy 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.650
 We will test finegpx functionality. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 I have now attached two 70s of love 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.859
 One product is like dmb assist for one gps function. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.710
 I would like to 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 One gps function by removing the dmb antenna 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:09.969
 Not working yet 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.379
 More than 10 beef 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.379
 Let's try initialization as informed 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.369
 Did you go to Jia Elementary School? 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.850
 As you can see, 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.060
 I already have a product that works with new features 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.869
 Daily game schedule 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.379
 Pixworks Works homework 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.659
 For the Brazilian national team 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.049
 Products that are not working 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.189
 I have not set a standard and can not speak. 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:54.619
 All products with high pass capability will have five pixels 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:55.139
 Receive 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.139
 It shows a fairly fast reception speed. 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:04.529
 It takes about 10 seconds to get at least five satellites 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:05.849
 With 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.679
 It is a foil. 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.730
 Most of the navigation devices available today are dmb 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.409
 A dense place called real-time traffic information service 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.229
 There is a lot. 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.859
 g market, etc. in order of bbk stock price manipulation 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.199
 Reporter Lee Jung-Yeon, who has experienced drivers 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.769
 One of the reasons for this is to start the car 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.549
 until western europe and 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.449
 Through mobile carriers 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.449
 I can judge it and do it to practice it. 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.109
 There is no existing dmb network. 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.259
 Pro Football Federation 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.259
 Using stems such as 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.309
 10 49 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.309
 wr 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.899
 it / federation 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.179
 Can we investigate new concept bbk
