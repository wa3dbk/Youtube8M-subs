00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
machine handles very well I like this

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.620 
machine handles very well I like this
because<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.009> has<00:00:14.160> reverse<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.450> makes

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
because it has reverse so it makes

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.880 
because it has reverse so it makes
docking<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.260> things<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
docking and things like that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.510 
docking and things like that
pretty<00:00:17.609> easy<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:19.590> acceleration<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.340> over

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
pretty easy the acceleration is over

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
pretty easy the acceleration is over
here<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> right<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.330> back<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.900> kind<00:00:22.590> of

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
going and then you break it will

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
going and then you break it will
actually<00:00:26.910> break<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.599> then<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.720> hold<00:00:27.960> down

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
push on the throttle and then it kind of

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.639 
push on the throttle and then it kind of
your<00:00:32.160> reverse<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> look<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.290> front
