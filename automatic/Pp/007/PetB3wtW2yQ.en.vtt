00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.520
 hello we are symphony that is not a 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.199
 gone and that's bente varlemann and us 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.600
 are here with the German-speaking 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.689
 championships in poetry slam in 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.670
 Bielefeld in Bielefeld 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.300
 side by side each other was them going 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.720
 anything like different materials not 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.720
 so 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 we just write good texts and we 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.140
 are also good on the stage so well 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.840
 we are both women that's alright 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.730
 Something out because there are also many 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 male teams year in singles 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.119
 So we both live approximately 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 of equal length 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.869
 I would say about eight years and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 the team has been around for three years now 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 and that's exactly what we were looking for 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 and found and almost have a lot 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.450
 a lot of individual experience because actually 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.250
 is a team text no team tags if it is 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.080
 a person from the team has written 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.300
 and then you carry this in front of three 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.009
 that should not be a team tags but 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.130
 team always means a common one 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.710
 creative work distance decrease 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 hours was the most important thing 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.530
 like you and me and only a millimeter 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.050
 much will I have will seem to animals 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 we on top of audio video and data 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.069
 cockpit and then I wanted to go back 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 we actually combine many elements 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.130
 I would say the most important thing about us 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.599
 but that's really it to us 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.610
 It is important that we also have a statement 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.410
 So we always want something to do 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.240
 say because we find that 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.190
 really important is on slam stage 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.190
 especially if you have teams, for example 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.410
 which is just funny text writing 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.429
 It also matters to us, too 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.590
 be funny but write the text 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.030
 but what has to say team is the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.120
 Royal class in poetry slam 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 Well, you can write that together 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.400
 yes, a thing 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.120
 Of course you have to do that too 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.250
 by discussing it mostly 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.540
 not always constructive sometimes 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.800
 a little mad at each other but it 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.030
 we'll be back in about fifteen minutes 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.980
 Of course, everything is on the stage 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 become a motto we rock the shit 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.640
 Fed yes there we always bring before 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.050
 that's exactly what we're gonna do tonight 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 also do we have and by all 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.370
 to take apart brothers 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.090
 colleague to sit 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.090
 Yes exactly 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.110
 Now two boys are coming to this 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.710
 jacking up you will hear on the names 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.710
 came 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.950
 a 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:25.970
 also at the beginning as our breath and the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.430
 Beat the street we touched up with and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.980
 wide pants and neon-colored ones have that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.440
 Gloomy city ​​is brought by and 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.540
 our feet spray cans graffiti on 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.540
 pavements stiff left 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:51.800
 For example , the water was the water 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.400
 Can be slow on the water 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400
 to stand water 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.630
 we can do the worst diseases 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.190
 but treat as much myself a 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.490
