00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.209
 Crowns hirers 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.999
 a new EU legislation 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.029
 they make tire pressure monitoring system 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.109
 McCourts Libya from 2012 for new vehicles duty 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.970
 The background is the discussion about the reduction of co2 emissions and emissions 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.550
 in particular the reduction of traffic accidents due to faulty 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 Tires and wrong tire pressure 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.020
 Johnson Controls has a new generation of its direct first 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.020
 wm-title developed it 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.700
 The trust that the animals nest the patented trademark for 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.750
 an author Don algorithm 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.830
 identifies the position of each tire sensor with the help of the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.730
 Information of the ARD it first the control unit and read it automatically 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.670
 and that with only one receiver 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.960
 Not only the right quote test systems will work in every bike 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.250
 Sensor installed 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 serve conventional low-cost systems 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.660
 in require the manual adoption of the statute 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.010
 after every case of child abduction 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 this process with expert assistance 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.470
 that's from the speed 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.180
 It comes with a single directly invested control unit 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.260
 integrated antenna 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.910
 It automatically detects the position of the sensors on the vehicle 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.490
 and is also capable of new sensors automatically 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 learn the language 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.550
 unlike similar systems with automatic sensors detection 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.040
 eliminates additional cabling effort quickly effort here 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.620
 the system costs can be significantly reduced 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.990
 every place will be so on a frequency of 433 megahertz pressure sensor 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.990
 and a distinctive identification identifier 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.110
 the transfer process provides an individualized, specific end 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.799
 benefits 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.979
 the recipient uses this profile to check that of the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.599
 defensive sensors behind the scenes 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.959
 and also for the sensors in the right kind of position back 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.400
 a new tire or set of tires is located in less than three minutes 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.499
 In addition, four others may be permanently stored 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.640
 this allows the assignment of another known Council sentence for 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.449
 Example when changing the summer and winter tires 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.799
 he knows the system will be supplemented with those already saved 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.039
 Sensors locate faster even when the tires are swapped and positions 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.119
 to be assembled 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.509
 The system is very reliable and recognizes one 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.369
 Tire pressure raffles in just one tire as well as even 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.369
 Pressure loss in all four tires 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.399
 at constant tire pressure over there it gets to the receiver once a minute 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.039
 Posted 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:07.079
 He sums up the system's conspicuous change of heart into a faster one 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.289
 Since increased sampling rate, the sensor measures several times per minute 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:17.329
 If a pressure difference occurs at the end of the once so promptly one is the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.339
 Train for 1 to the radio receiver 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.769
 while driving a pressure loss can be displayed within ten seconds 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 become 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.689
 the tires lose through natural discussion for a long time 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.659
 when the vehicle is parked, tire pressure would be lower, saving energy 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.349
 Frequency second measured 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.289
 Compared to the indirect system, the direct measuring cite develops 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.339
 is by Johnson Controls casting pressure loss after the start of the 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.139
 Vehicle within about 5 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.999
 The high-performance tire pressure sensors are already recognizing 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.999
 a hand penalty in the lead of 70 meters 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.829
 Indirect measuring systems need up to 1 for this purpose 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.919
 regular monitoring of tire pressure on ecological and 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.499
 economic benefits 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.870
 Optimum tire pressure increases driving safety and comfort 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.609
 If I look at the fuel consumption and thus spares the environment are unnecessary 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.609
 Tire wear traded 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.509
 the security on it 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:24.659
 Consumption down 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.400
 With the innovative therapies, Johnson Controls set new standards 

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.300
 Standards in research 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.620
 at the same time opened 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.240
 EU more equitable road safety and less CO2 emissions
