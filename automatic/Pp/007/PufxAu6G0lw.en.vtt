 Now I put cucumbers here. I always 

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:56.600
 I stack it like this it stands like this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.450
 more convenient gave a jar then they come out 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.079

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.299

 put them so fold cucumber 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:13.130
 pour boiling water over cucumbers and let stand 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.740
 15 minutes we lay on top in such a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.080
 a lid through which you can drain the water 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.260
 and we will wait for cucumbers 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.500
 stood for 15-20 minutes we should hug 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.240
 jar hands and the bank should be 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.100
 warm so you can keep on her 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.110
 hand because what is there so that you 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.910
 you ca n't do it then 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.460
 really warm enough to be able to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.130
 hold the water you need to drain now 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.560
 need to remove the cover so stuck 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.720
 buns and pour new boiling water if u 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.570
 You do not have such a cover to merge and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.900
 ready you can take the usual cover just 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.690
 hold it cover we wait still 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.360
 15-20 minutes now prepare the pickle 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.090
 the water that we merged our cucumbers 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.800
 the very first time we are not sure about her and here 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.800
 Now here we are going to do from her 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.890
 simple chic pour salt here how much 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.350
 By effect, I pointed out of sugar and set 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.750
 on fire so she started to boil like 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.290
 only she will boil we pour vinegar into it and 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.990
 fill the jar with boiling water should be boiling 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.320
 water began to boil pour into it 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.230
 vinegar and wait for it to completely 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.260
 boiling and boiling should be poured into jars 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.709
 bath the second time completely cooled and and 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.410
 It must be drained which is now boiling water 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.459
 already turned out with us 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:44.090
 Our fat we pour our cucumbers 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:50.090
 I will cover and roll 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:54.320
 turn over to not flow with us 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:59.840
 the waters we put on a rag you can even 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.970
 around down twist like this so that the water 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.530
 do not flow spot covers ensure that 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.320
 tightly closed everything here is confusing and 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.540
 wrap such cucumbers unnecessary they 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.030
 should just stand on the kitchen floor and 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.830
 here is from the last you cloth completely 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.549
 I will change 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.470
 you color and become such a protective color 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.600
 they don't explode they are well worth it 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.660
 the main thing is that every time before 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.510
 you poured the bank water was already cold 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.790
 so that the sheep warmed well here
