shown<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> board<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.359> have

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
shown on the board so we have

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.750

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.590 
ation so let's begin with the process of
phosphorylation<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> phosphorylation<00:01:17.600> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
phosphorylation so phosphorylation is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.620 
phosphorylation so phosphorylation is
the<00:01:19.080> addition<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.070> phosphate<00:01:20.340> group<00:01:20.820> onto

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the addition of a phosphate group onto

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
polypeptide chain and the enzyme that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
polypeptide chain and the enzyme that
basically<00:01:31.970> catalyzes<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> addition<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750

phosphate group is known as protein

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.580 
phosphate group is known as protein
kinases<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.159> by<00:01:38.579> adding<00:01:39.299> our<00:01:39.450> phosphate<00:01:40.259> group

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
kinases so by adding our phosphate group

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370 
kinases so by adding our phosphate group
on<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.159> our<00:01:41.400> polypeptide<00:01:42.390> chain<00:01:42.840> we're

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
transduction now the second type of post

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.359 
transduction now the second type of post
translational<00:02:05.759> modification<00:02:06.719> is

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
translational modification is

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.880 
translational modification is
methylation<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> meth

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
methylation and meth

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.220 
methylation and meth
is<00:02:09.429> basically<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.300> addition<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.200> methyl

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
is basically the addition of a methyl

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.360 
is basically the addition of a methyl
group<00:02:11.950> onto<00:02:12.480> certain<00:02:13.480> amino<00:02:13.840> acids<00:02:14.560> via<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
group onto certain amino acids via the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.620 
group onto certain amino acids via the
enzyme<00:02:15.850> known<00:02:16.270> as<00:02:16.540> methyl<00:02:16.890> transferase<00:02:17.890> so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
enzyme known as methyl transferase so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.830 
enzyme known as methyl transferase so
methylation<00:02:19.630> usually<00:02:20.170> increases<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
methylation usually increases the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.480 
methylation usually increases the
hydrophobic<00:02:22.840> character<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.740> enzyme<00:02:24.220> and

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
hydrophobic character of the enzyme and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.750 
hydrophobic character of the enzyme and
so<00:02:24.940> those<00:02:25.740> polypeptides<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:27.459> are

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
so those polypeptides that are

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.920 
so those polypeptides that are
methylated<00:02:28.650> basically<00:02:29.650> increase<00:02:30.160> their

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
methylated basically increase their

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.620 
methylated basically increase their
hydrophobic<00:02:31.930> character<00:02:32.500> as<00:02:32.620> well<00:02:32.950> now

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
hydrophobic character as well now

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.600 
hydrophobic character as well now
methylation<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.810> utilized<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.980> process

and<00:05:20.520> acetylation<00:05:21.520> plays<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.420> crucial<00:05:22.810> role<00:05:23.140> in

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
and acetylation plays a crucial role in

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.420 
and acetylation plays a crucial role in
gene<00:05:24.340> expression<00:05:24.900> histones<00:05:25.900> those<00:05:26.650> proteins

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
gene expression histones those proteins

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.870 
gene expression histones those proteins
that<00:05:27.760> are<00:05:28.060> involved<00:05:28.780> in<00:05:28.930> condensing<00:05:29.920> our<00:05:30.100> DNA

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
that are involved in condensing our DNA

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.410 
that are involved in condensing our DNA
into<00:05:31.720> chromatids<00:05:32.590> can<00:05:33.280> be<00:05:33.460> met<00:05:33.730> or<00:05:33.970> can<00:05:34.270> be

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
into chromatids can be met or can be

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.070 
into chromatids can be met or can be
acid<00:05:34.980> acetylated<00:05:35.980> which<00:05:36.700> reduces<00:05:37.540> their

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
acid acetylated which reduces their

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.120 
acid acetylated which reduces their
ability<00:05:38.140> to<00:05:38.770> fold<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.700> opens<00:05:40.270> up<00:05:40.480> our<00:05:40.750> DNA<00:05:41.500> so

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
ability to fold and opens up our DNA so

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.380 
ability to fold and opens up our DNA so
that<00:05:42.370> that<00:05:42.760> DNA<00:05:43.300> section<00:05:43.960> can<00:05:44.170> undergo<00:05:44.500> the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
that that DNA section can undergo the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.960 
that that DNA section can undergo the
transcriptional<00:05:46.390> process<00:05:47.020> now<00:05:47.770> finally<00:05:48.580> the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
transcriptional process now finally the

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.850 
transcriptional process now finally the
final<00:05:49.240> process<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:50.260> we're<00:05:50.500> going<00:05:50.680> to

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
final process that we're going to

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.060 
final process that we're going to
discuss<00:05:51.340> is<00:05:51.610> lipid<00:05:52.390> ation<00:05:52.900> so<00:05:53.140> lipid<00:05:53.530> ation<00:05:53.950> is

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
discuss is lipid ation so lipid ation is

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.000 
discuss is lipid ation so lipid ation is
the<00:05:54.190> process<00:05:54.730> by<00:05:54.970> which<00:05:55.000> we<00:05:55.540> add<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:56.170> lipid

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
the process by which we add a lipid

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.380 
the process by which we add a lipid
component<00:05:57.760> onto<00:05:58.510> our<00:05:58.950> polypeptide<00:05:59.950> chain<00:06:00.400> now

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
component onto our polypeptide chain now

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.020 
component onto our polypeptide chain now
why<00:06:02.080> would<00:06:02.470> we<00:06:02.500> want<00:06:02.920> to<00:06:03.130> add<00:06:03.280> a<00:06:03.610> lipid

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
why would we want to add a lipid

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.140 
why would we want to add a lipid
component<00:06:04.630> onto<00:06:04.810> a<00:06:05.260> polypeptide<00:06:06.190> chain

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
component onto a polypeptide chain

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.780 
component onto a polypeptide chain
well<00:06:07.540> basically<00:06:08.320> those<00:06:08.650> proteins<00:06:09.490> that

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
well basically those proteins that

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.330 
well basically those proteins that
ultimately<00:06:10.630> end<00:06:10.960> up<00:06:11.290> in<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:11.650> membrane

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
ultimately end up in a membrane

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.400 
ultimately end up in a membrane
for<00:06:12.640> example<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.360> mitochondrial<00:06:14.230> membrane

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
for example the mitochondrial membrane

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.030 
for example the mitochondrial membrane
the<00:06:15.220> endoplasmic<00:06:15.780> reticulum<00:06:16.780> membrane<00:06:17.040> or

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.790 
the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or
the<00:06:18.070> plasma<00:06:18.460> membrane<00:06:19.210> these<00:06:19.720> proteins<00:06:20.530> that

the plasma membrane these proteins that

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
the plasma membrane these proteins that

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
end up on a membrane need to actually

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.760 
end up on a membrane need to actually
incorporate<00:06:24.820> themselves<00:06:25.090> into<00:06:26.080> those

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
incorporate themselves into those

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.730 
incorporate themselves into those
membranes<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:27.970> because<00:06:28.450> lipids<00:06:29.080> can<00:06:29.260> sit<00:06:29.590> or

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
membranes and because lipids can sit or

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.610 
membranes and because lipids can sit or
because<00:06:30.100> membranes<00:06:30.730> consist<00:06:31.360> of<00:06:31.570> lipids<00:06:32.110> by

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
because membranes consist of lipids by

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.220 
because membranes consist of lipids by
adding<00:06:33.190> a<00:06:33.340> lipid<00:06:33.910> component<00:06:34.630> onto<00:06:34.810> our

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
adding a lipid component onto our

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.970 
adding a lipid component onto our
protein

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
protein

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.840 
protein
we're<00:06:36.660> increasing<00:06:37.660> that<00:06:38.230> proteins<00:06:39.010> affinity

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
we're increasing that proteins affinity

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.170 
we're increasing that proteins affinity
to<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.720> membrane<00:06:41.290> so<00:06:41.650> this<00:06:41.890> process<00:06:42.580> is<00:06:42.850> known

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
to the membrane so this process is known

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.090 
to the membrane so this process is known
as<00:06:43.380> lipid<00:06:44.380> ation<00:06:44.950> so<00:06:45.850> we<00:06:46.540> saw<00:06:46.840> that

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
as lipid ation so we saw that

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.260 
as lipid ation so we saw that
phosphorylation<00:06:48.270> methylation

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
phosphorylation methylation

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.110 
phosphorylation methylation
glycosylation<00:06:50.340> proteolysis<00:06:51.340> and

acetylation<00:06:53.080> and<00:06:53.470> lipid<00:06:53.890> ation<00:06:54.370> are<00:06:54.520> six

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
acetylation and lipid ation are six

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.900 
acetylation and lipid ation are six
different<00:06:55.210> processes<00:06:56.110> that<00:06:56.560> are<00:06:57.280> known<00:06:57.580> as

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
different processes that are known as

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.380 
different processes that are known as
post<00:06:58.650> translational<00:06:59.650> modification<00:07:00.640> so<00:07:00.910> these

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
post translational modification so these

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.590 
post translational modification so these
are<00:07:01.780> the<00:07:02.080> ways<00:07:02.350> by<00:07:02.710> which<00:07:02.740> our<00:07:03.600> polypeptides

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
are the ways by which our polypeptides

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.010 
are the ways by which our polypeptides
are<00:07:04.900> modified<00:07:05.680> following<00:07:06.580> the<00:07:07.120> process<00:07:07.810> of
