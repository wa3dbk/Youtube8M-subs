00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.919 

okay<00:00:02.220> just<00:00:02.610> wanted<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.879> show<00:00:03.210> off<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.389> combo

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay just wanted to show off my combo

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay just wanted to show off my combo
point<00:00:04.140> generator<00:00:04.560> which<00:00:05.779> regenerated<00:00:06.779> but<00:00:06.870> it

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
point generator which regenerated but it

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.470 
point generator which regenerated but it
shows<00:00:07.140> how<00:00:07.550> many<00:00:08.550> combo<00:00:08.940> points<00:00:09.210> you've<00:00:09.300> got

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
shows how many combo points you've got

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.820 
shows how many combo points you've got
on<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> series<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.080> LEDs<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:12.710> demonstrate<00:00:13.710> it

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
on a series of LEDs and demonstrate it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.200 
on a series of LEDs and demonstrate it
here<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.370> I'm<00:00:14.549> using<00:00:14.580> pearl

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
here you can see I'm using pearl

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.090 
here you can see I'm using pearl
so<00:00:15.719> those<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.230> combo<00:00:16.590> points<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:16.980> my

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
so those are my combo points on my

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.880 
so those are my combo points on my
target<00:00:17.449> and<00:00:18.449> if<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.050> mangle<00:00:20.090> close<00:00:21.090> enough

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
target and if I mangle close enough

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.920 
target and if I mangle close enough
shred<00:00:22.890> accidentally<00:00:23.580> you'll<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.269> want<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
shred accidentally you'll see I want to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
shred accidentally you'll see I want to
put<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.199> combo<00:00:25.529> point<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.789> LED<00:00:27.150> came<00:00:27.330> on

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
put one combo point and one LED came on

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.700 
put one combo point and one LED came on
and<00:00:28.320> hit<00:00:28.859> again<00:00:29.599> crit<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> got<00:00:31.080> three<00:00:31.349> combo

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and hit again crit so I got three combo

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
and hit again crit so I got three combo
points<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.660> three<00:00:34.200> LEDs<00:00:36.020> hit<00:00:37.020> them

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
points and I got three LEDs hit them

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.600 
points and I got three LEDs hit them
again<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.820> up<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> four<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> final

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
again and up to four and on the final

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.209 
again and up to four and on the final
the<00:00:41.610> last<00:00:41.820> level<00:00:42.059> come<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.270> four<00:00:42.770> side<00:00:43.770> points

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the last level come on four side points

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.910 
the last level come on four side points
and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.000> five<00:00:45.629> LEDs<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:47.610> when<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.770> use<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and then five LEDs then when I use the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.880 
and then five LEDs then when I use the
finishing<00:00:50.280> move<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:50.940> clear<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> zero

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
finishing move it will clear it to zero

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.180 
finishing move it will clear it to zero
and<00:00:52.890> turn<00:00:53.610> all<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> lights<00:00:53.879> off<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.070> can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and turn all the lights off and I can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.869 
and turn all the lights off and I can
just<00:00:56.340> keep<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:58.460> bill<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> come<00:00:59.699> up

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
just keep going with it bill to come up

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
just keep going with it bill to come up
and<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.719> constantly<00:01:01.140> stay<00:01:01.469> up

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and it will it will constantly stay up

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.939 
and it will it will constantly stay up
with<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> time<00:01:03.350> no<00:01:04.350> matter<00:01:04.379> how<00:01:04.650> many

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
with it all the time no matter how many

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:16.649 
with it all the time no matter how many
I<00:01:05.070> use

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.580 

so<00:01:17.170> yeah<00:01:17.259> that's<00:01:17.380> said<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.950> Arduino<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
so yeah that's said that the Arduino is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.660 
so yeah that's said that the Arduino is
the<00:01:20.740> standard<00:01:21.130> Arduino<00:01:21.549> Uno<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.369> couple

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
the standard Arduino Uno with a couple

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.679 
the standard Arduino Uno with a couple
LEDs<00:01:28.000> running<00:01:28.630> with<00:01:28.720> some<00:01:28.810> 580<00:01:29.229> ohm<00:01:29.380> resistors

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
LEDs running with some 580 ohm resistors

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.270 
LEDs running with some 580 ohm resistors
focus<00:01:31.689> OOP<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.939> then<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.979> software<00:01:35.979> that's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
focus OOP and then the software that's

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.080 
focus OOP and then the software that's
reading<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.049> essentially<00:01:38.049> just<00:01:38.200> using<00:01:39.090> power

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
reading it essentially just using power

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.309 
reading it essentially just using power
R<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.630> classic<00:01:41.229> put<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.770> white<00:01:42.039> dot<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.840> colored

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
R is classic put a white dot or colored

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.450 
R is classic put a white dot or colored
that<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.530> should<00:01:44.799> say<00:01:44.920> based<00:01:45.189> on<00:01:45.310> how<00:01:45.399> many

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
that I should say based on how many

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.330 
that I should say based on how many
combo<00:01:45.909> points<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.299> like<00:01:46.420> I'm<00:01:46.539> at<00:01:46.659> zero<00:01:46.929> now<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
combo points so like I'm at zero now and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.630 
combo points so like I'm at zero now and
then<00:01:48.670> green<00:01:49.270> for<00:01:49.569> 1<00:01:50.009> yellow<00:01:51.009> green<00:01:51.220> for<00:01:51.459> two

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
then green for 1 yellow green for two

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.699 
then green for 1 yellow green for two
yellow<00:01:52.509> for<00:01:52.780> three<00:01:54.330> orange<00:01:55.330> for<00:01:55.539> four<00:01:56.439> and

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
yellow for three orange for four and

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.199 
yellow for three orange for four and
then<00:01:56.830> red<00:01:57.069> for<00:01:58.030> five<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:59.409> I've<00:01:59.560> got<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:01.119> a

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
then red for five and I've got just a

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.339 
then red for five and I've got just a
little<00:02:03.390> Arduino<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.450> reading<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:05.020> color<00:02:05.319> and

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
little Arduino is reading that color and

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.270 
little Arduino is reading that color and
just<00:02:08.349> in<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.619> combo<00:02:08.950> points<00:02:09.280> based<00:02:09.489> on<00:02:09.670> that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
just in the combo points based on that

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.089 
just in the combo points based on that
how<00:02:12.280> many<00:02:12.489> I've<00:02:12.610> got

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.290 

so<00:02:19.099> that's<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.430> took<00:02:19.640> all<00:02:19.790> about<00:02:20.030> probably

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
so that's that took all about probably

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.580 
so that's that took all about probably
over<00:02:21.050> 23<00:02:21.410> hours<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:21.980> set<00:02:22.250> up<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:23.590> was

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
over 23 hours to get all set up I was

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.720 
over 23 hours to get all set up I was
trying<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.830> figure<00:02:25.040> out<00:02:25.099> how<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.340> actually

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
trying to figure out how to actually

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.920 
trying to figure out how to actually
read<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.900> color<00:02:27.260> off<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.650> screen
