00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
robot reacts accordingly now if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
robot reacts accordingly now if
avoidance<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.200> approach

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
avoidance is on and we approach

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
avoidance is on and we approach
something<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> should<00:01:11.580> avoid<00:01:11.820> such<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
something that it should avoid such as a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.039 
something that it should avoid such as a
cliff<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.880> avoid<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> cliff<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
cliff it will avoid the cliff and as you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
cliff it will avoid the cliff and as you
can<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> screen<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.490> say<00:01:17.700> cliff

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
can see on the screen it will say cliff

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.630 
can see on the screen it will say cliff
instead<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.619> direction<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.310> let's<00:01:20.520> try

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
instead of the direction so let's try

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.990 
instead of the direction so let's try
that<00:01:20.790> again<00:01:20.900> one<00:01:21.900> more<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:23.060> clip<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that again one more time clip and if the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.679 
that again one more time clip and if the
robot<00:01:27.479> encounters<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.590> obstacle<00:01:28.820> like<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.119> wall

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.510 

it<00:01:33.689> will<00:01:33.869> avoid<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> wall<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> screen

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it will avoid the wall and on the screen

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.539 
it will avoid the wall and on the screen
you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> says<00:01:36.119> obstruction<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> turn

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you can see it says obstruction so turn

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:49.520 
you can see it says obstruction so turn
it<00:01:38.579> around<00:01:38.759> try<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.570> more<00:01:39.659> time

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.679 

you<00:01:50.530> see<00:01:50.710> obstruction<00:01:51.189> again<00:01:51.400> now<00:01:52.330> if<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.479> want

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
you see obstruction again now if we want

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.060 
you see obstruction again now if we want
to<00:01:52.720> change<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.140> motor<00:01:53.290> speed<00:01:53.649> if<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.860> make<00:01:54.040> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
to change the motor speed if we make it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.830 
to change the motor speed if we make it
want<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.369> make<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.610> faster<00:01:54.970> slower<00:01:55.299> we<00:01:55.659> hit

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
want to make it faster slower we hit

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.570 
want to make it faster slower we hit
both<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.200> these<00:01:56.380> buttons<00:01:56.649> simultaneously<00:01:56.890> to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
both of these buttons simultaneously to

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.270 
both of these buttons simultaneously to
go<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.909> main<00:01:58.060> menu<00:01:58.590> select<00:01:59.590> slip<00:02:00.039> motor

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
go to the main menu select slip motor

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.969 
go to the main menu select slip motor
speed<00:02:00.780> we'll<00:02:01.780> set<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.619> maximum

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
speed we'll set it to the maximum

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.649 
speed we'll set it to the maximum
possible<00:02:03.310> speed<00:02:03.729> which<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.450> limit

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
possible speed which is going to limit

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.540 
possible speed which is going to limit
avoidance<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:05.350> we'll<00:02:05.470> try<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.710> anyways<00:02:06.039> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.919 

now<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.789> see<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> motor<00:02:10.300> speed<00:02:10.630> is<00:02:10.780> set

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
now you can see the motor speed is set

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.559 
now you can see the motor speed is set
to<00:02:11.050> 900<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.489> can<00:02:12.640> see<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
to 900 and you can see that on the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.890 
to 900 and you can see that on the
remote<00:02:13.989> device<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.459> also<00:02:16.260> 900<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> here<00:02:19.840> we

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
remote device it is also 900 so here we

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.840 
remote device it is also 900 so here we
go<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.200> quite<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.440> bit

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
go as you can see it is quite a bit

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.750 
go as you can see it is quite a bit
quicker<00:02:27.569> now<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.870> node<00:02:29.610> avoidance<00:02:30.610> is

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
quicker now in this node avoidance is

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
quicker now in this node avoidance is
not<00:02:30.970> quite<00:02:31.600> as<00:02:31.720> responsive<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.470> still<00:02:32.650> avoids

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
not quite as responsive it still avoids

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.340 
not quite as responsive it still avoids
obstacles<00:02:33.480> pretty<00:02:34.480> little<00:02:34.720> bit<00:02:34.810> cliffs<00:02:35.110> are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
obstacles pretty little bit cliffs are

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.400 
obstacles pretty little bit cliffs are
limited<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:37.709> that's<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:40.330> can<00:02:40.510> also<00:02:40.660> i'll

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
limited so that's that you can also i'll

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.979 
limited so that's that you can also i'll
try<00:02:41.709> making<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> speed<00:02:43.030> slower<00:02:43.720> than<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
try making the speed slower than the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.070 
try making the speed slower than the
default<00:02:44.530> which<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.010> 200<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.480> we'll<00:02:46.690> change<00:02:46.870> it

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
default which is 200 so we'll change it

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:58.349 
default which is 200 so we'll change it
to<00:02:47.260> let's<00:02:47.530> say<00:02:50.790> jinto<00:02:53.670> 120<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.340> speed<00:02:58.239> is

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
to let's say jinto 120 and the speed is

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.970 
to let's say jinto 120 and the speed is
changed<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.690> 120<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.500> can<00:02:59.650> see<00:02:59.799> another

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
changed to 120 you can see another

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.580 
changed to 120 you can see another
remote<00:03:00.250> device<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.760> has<00:03:00.790> changed<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.299> 120<00:03:07.590> you

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
remote device it has changed to 120 you

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.710 
remote device it has changed to 120 you
can<00:03:08.739> see<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.299> slower<00:03:10.299> than<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.510> was

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
can see that it is slower than it was

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.260 
can see that it is slower than it was
before

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.220 

you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.450> also<00:03:15.569> change<00:03:16.100> avoidance<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.580> off<00:03:18.500> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
you can also change avoidance to off to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.140 
you can also change avoidance to off to
turn<00:03:22.230> off<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.650> collision<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.880> cliff

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
turn off the collision and cliff

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.949 
turn off the collision and cliff
detection<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.330> we<00:03:27.390> run<00:03:27.660> into<00:03:27.780> an

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
detection so now if we run into an

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.130 
detection so now if we run into an
obstacle<00:03:29.000> nothing<00:03:30.000> happens<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.570> still<00:03:30.870> says

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
obstacle nothing happens it still says

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.500 
obstacle nothing happens it still says
forward<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.709> screen<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:35.000> remote<00:03:36.000> NXT

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
forward on the screen and the remote NXT

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.570 
forward on the screen and the remote NXT
just<00:03:36.810> spins<00:03:37.380> instead<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.100> avoiding<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
just spins instead of avoiding the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.350 
just spins instead of avoiding the
object<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:43.950> was<00:03:44.220> my<00:03:44.250> demonstration<00:03:45.150> of

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
object so that was my demonstration of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.040 
object so that was my demonstration of
Bluetooth<00:03:45.810> NXT<00:03:46.320> control<00:03:47.360> we<00:03:48.360> will<00:03:48.480> now<00:03:48.630> shut

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
Bluetooth NXT control we will now shut

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.800 
Bluetooth NXT control we will now shut
down<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> program<00:03:49.560> by<00:03:50.130> exiting<00:03:50.730> out<00:03:50.910> it's

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
down the program by exiting out it's

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.430 
down the program by exiting out it's
going<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.050> disconnect<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:53.780> remote<00:03:54.780> NXT<00:03:55.290> is

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
going to disconnect the remote NXT is

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.710 
going to disconnect the remote NXT is
going<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.330> go<00:03:57.330> back<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.720> main<00:03:57.870> menu<00:03:57.900> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
going to go back to the main menu and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.410 
going to go back to the main menu and
that<00:04:00.720> concludes<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.260> demonstration
