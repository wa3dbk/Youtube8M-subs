00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 but before the start of this video clip 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.879
 I want to advise you channel and viano so 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.680
 on its channel you can find different 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.440
 videos on the game minecraft poket 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.700
 edishn terrarii much different also here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.440
 there is a hungry and cretin tyrant and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.970
 many other things mod reviews 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.070
 and so on so we go 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.029
 I subscribe to a reference to write I personally 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.029
 already subscribed 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.690
 hello friends with you simple and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.540
 Today, we channel new section on 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.190
 minecraft engine breathes on 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.040
 version 010 40 10 5 and everything seems to be 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.920
 because this mod doesn't seem to be 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.239
 Added exactly such a tmart from 8 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.089
 bit did not seem to add edishn fact 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:03.320
 this mod on minecraft redstone game 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.170
 pocket edition and today I have 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.759
 such a mechanism to this fashion 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.410
 the mechanism is called automatically 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.039
 steps as we know what's under it 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.869
 mod 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.090
 not yet added sticky pistons because 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.550
 how the mechanism will not really do then 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.320
 but I made this mechanism in order to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.270
 just check the activity will either 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.390
 caretakers will not be husky or not 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.680
 there will be varnishes but i hope there will be huskies 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.570
 I'll show you how this mechanism works later. 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.479
 because i'm chatting already almost kissing 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.119
 minutes, look, we press the block and we 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.740
 here pops up such here 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.380
 stairs and we can climb now 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.530
 back that is up here in this 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.600
 perimeter of the room 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.060
 but if we want to close something but nothing 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.960
 because itâ€™s not added yet 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.110
 sticky pistons 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.450
 But I think it will be easier to just take something. 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.549
 where to block it is not part of 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.130
 such work we will show how 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.650
 This mechanism works see for 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.140
 our lever and here 12 then three 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.810
 chuck there redstone three blocks 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.929
 redstone 3 motes then move aside 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.940
 2 put 3 here right here we put 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.880
 the piston then build this 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.970
 construct three blocks here like this so 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.310
 here we put the piston again then here 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.549
 so it makes stone and we lead again 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.470
 signal to three blocks here in this direction and 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.030
 again we put the piston here is such a mechanism 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.040
 who liked put like write 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.100
 I hope you liked the comment 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.590
 I hope this mechanism is simple 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.590
 good luck to all and all bye bye
