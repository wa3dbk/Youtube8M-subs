00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.580
 series of a real constant blazer then 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.460
 I'm very indicative and I'll do the review 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.520
 what now for you about this incarnate 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.909
 here as the first part of the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.530
 story is practically the whole narrative 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.530
 because it is all told through 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.079
 reminders and begins with a gift 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.720
 He drinks coffee and reflects on the 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.090
 thinking about life and the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.820
 events after the discovery of its 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 disease and the stages in which people 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.799
 are in this situation that he or she 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 and has few dialogues but no 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.610
 leaves boring history is a resource for 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.590
 approaching the reader should be the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.780
 It's up to you to understand the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.840
 If you discover that you are 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 cancer and from the second part to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.549
 history already gains more movement with 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.329
 johnny first looking for an old 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.629
 friend also a magician with the intention of 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.970

 johnson to save your soul 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.730
 the devil who goes to pick him up personally 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.560
 huh 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.700
 the way they acted like john he 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.319
 The drowsy is the captain there. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.230
 of the best moments of this 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.810
 so clever a character that he 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.480
 is nobody in the following stories of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.420
 saga is johnny and says goodbye to his 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.840
 until an idea comes up. 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.390
 unused his mind and that is him 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.150
 sell the soul to three demons and in 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.579
 then he attempts to commit suicide and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.470
 This may help you beat cancer. 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.780
 I will not say it's best left to you. 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.239
 read it for me it's one of the most 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.849
 geniuses I've seen in stories of 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.609
 terror and still a space for a drama 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.099
 in the form of a new friend that one makes a 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.930
 hospitalized in the hospital who also 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.989
 Are you cancer free? 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.910
 in terminal phase called met and is very 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.310
 good the way they put you 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.349
 accompanies in the main story 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.239
 but today he is always on the visit to 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.819
 this friend of yours and for you have a 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.620
 the garfe enix when he took over the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.810
 real player control 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.079
 he was only 21 years old and that's what 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.690
 It freaks if we analyze an ar4 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.090
 dangerous because it seems to be a 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.849
 very mature and he puts the constantin 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.519
 in a unique situation that the magician does not 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.250
 can solve things the way 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.280
 he is accustomed but not only by this 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.250
 This is impressive because 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.400
 pages are filled with reflections on 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.160
 life friendship love and that's what 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.280
 It really freaks out at this work times. 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.799
 for long pages we do not even see 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.750
 a constantine smile just his 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.479
 face closed in process 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.300
 introspection that only those who have seen 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.419
 a situation have already lived a situation 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.900
 where there is no way out, they can 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.840
 That's why I say jealousy if you want. 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.660
 begin to read the constantin begin because 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.699
 This guy incarnate here can look 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.949
 this incarnate that I believe that if you 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.159
 looking for you can still find beyond 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.200
 It is also here that he served as 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:51.110
 inspiration for the character movie 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.350
 in 5 but if you saw this movie was the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.100
 It causes you to forget anything. 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.920
 stay there again 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.470
 although it is not true that the fact defense 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.470
 he has cancer, he served as a 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.120
 basis of the script as well as a 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.880
 participation of the angel gabriel that he 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.120
 Also, Johnny does not appear here. 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.980
 ask for help to play role but he only 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.320
 appears in the film on bad that the movie does not 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.780
 forget to refine that it is not there. 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.930
 constant and will never be military constant 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.440
 and I do not doubt anything if this saga is here 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.630
 be inspired or involved 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.540

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.950
