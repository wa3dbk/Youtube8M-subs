little things around you know like in in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.460 
little things around you know like in in
Skyrim<00:01:11.570> for<00:01:11.750> instance<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.110> can<00:01:12.229> go<00:01:12.380> around

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
Skyrim for instance you can go around

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.560 
Skyrim for instance you can go around
like<00:01:12.830> picking<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:13.220> baskets<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:13.939> buckets<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
like picking up baskets and buckets and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.320 
like picking up baskets and buckets and
pies<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.260> cheeses<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.890> stuff<00:01:16.189> I<00:01:16.640> didn't<00:01:17.210> see

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
pies and cheeses and stuff I didn't see

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.090 
pies and cheeses and stuff I didn't see
so<00:01:17.479> many<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.780> those<00:01:17.900> lying<00:01:18.409> around<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:18.950> was

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
so many of those lying around but I was

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.710 
so many of those lying around but I was
also<00:01:19.220> in<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> very<00:01:19.850> early<00:01:19.909> parts<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.570> game

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
also in the very early parts of the game

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.359 
also in the very early parts of the game
that's<00:01:20.930> that's<00:01:21.380> kind<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.710> stupid<00:01:21.860> nitpick

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
that's that's kind of a stupid nitpick

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.340 
that's that's kind of a stupid nitpick
but<00:01:22.400> again<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.780> conceits<00:01:24.110> of<00:01:24.229> this

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
but again one of the conceits of this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.740 
but again one of the conceits of this
being<00:01:24.590> an<00:01:24.710> online<00:01:24.890> game<00:01:25.340> obviously<00:01:25.970> combat<00:01:26.600> is

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
being an online game obviously combat is

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.300 
being an online game obviously combat is
a<00:01:26.780> huge<00:01:26.990> part<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.650> Elder<00:01:27.830> Scrolls<00:01:27.860> games

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
a huge part of the Elder Scrolls games

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.270 
a huge part of the Elder Scrolls games
and<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.790> guess<00:01:29.030> games<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.780> general

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
and I guess games in general

now<00:03:06.270> coming<00:03:06.600> back<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.750> classes<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:08.160> are

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
now coming back to classes there are

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.740 
now coming back to classes there are
three<00:03:08.580> classes<00:03:09.030> they<00:03:09.150> announce<00:03:09.450> there's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
three classes they announce there's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.540 
three classes they announce there's
templer<00:03:10.140> sorcerer<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.650> dragon<00:03:11.160> knight<00:03:11.310> and

templer sorcerer or dragon knight and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.550 
templer sorcerer or dragon knight and
then<00:03:11.670> i<00:03:11.850> think<00:03:12.180> during<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.690> Q&amp;A<00:03:12.900> session<00:03:13.050> they

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
then i think during a Q&amp;A session they

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
then i think during a Q&amp;A session they
accidentally<00:03:14.070> leaked<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.460> night<00:03:14.700> blade<00:03:14.940> was

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
accidentally leaked that night blade was

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.670 
accidentally leaked that night blade was
would<00:03:15.360> be<00:03:15.510> one<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:15.900> yeah<00:03:16.050> there<00:03:16.290> are<00:03:16.410> classes

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
would be one so yeah there are classes

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.350 
would be one so yeah there are classes

in the older Scrolls online but they're

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.960 
in the older Scrolls online but they're
they're<00:03:18.630> not<00:03:18.780> really<00:03:19.020> limiting<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.970> you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
painted in a one corner it defines what

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.730 
painted in a one corner it defines what
abilities<00:03:24.900> your<00:03:25.020> character<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> get

abilities your character is going to get

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.470

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
the game really however the hell you

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.400 
the game really however the hell you
want<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> think<00:03:30.960> people<00:03:31.140> are<00:03:31.200> probably

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
want and I think people are probably

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.900 
want and I think people are probably
gonna<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:31.830> creative<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.580> but

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
gonna get really creative with that but

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.340 
gonna get really creative with that but
if<00:03:33.090> they've<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> little<00:03:34.020> bit<00:03:34.200> more

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
if they've like a little bit more

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.500 
if they've like a little bit more

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
and I think a lot of people felt that

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.350 
and I think a lot of people felt that
way<00:05:43.110> too<00:05:43.520> after<00:05:44.520> getting<00:05:44.610> some<00:05:44.850> hands-on<00:05:45.210> time

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
way too after getting some hands-on time

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.210 
way too after getting some hands-on time
with<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:45.990> gotta<00:05:46.200> say<00:05:46.440> I<00:05:46.680> don't<00:05:46.860> feel<00:05:47.190> that

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
with it I gotta say I don't feel that

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.950 
with it I gotta say I don't feel that
way<00:05:47.460> anymore<00:05:47.540> obviously<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.630> experience

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
way anymore obviously the experience

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.050
