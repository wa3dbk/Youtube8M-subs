00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.490 
what
I<00:01:01.940> did<00:01:02.360> not<00:01:02.450> do<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.690> bench<00:01:02.840> that<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.350> did

it at the combine again you know I
thought<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.300> was<00:01:05.360> more<00:01:05.540> important<00:01:05.930> for<00:01:05.960> me<00:01:06.140> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
thought it was more important for me to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
think that 21 is a respectful number it

and<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.240> mean<00:02:02.470> yeah<00:02:03.640> fat<00:02:04.640> times<00:02:04.940> but<00:02:05.330> they<00:02:05.990> got

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
and I mean yeah fat times but they got

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.020 
and I mean yeah fat times but they got
to<00:02:06.200> evaluate<00:02:06.770> all<00:02:06.980> these<00:02:07.130> players<00:02:07.340> somehow<00:02:07.790> I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
to evaluate all these players somehow I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.140 
to evaluate all these players somehow I
mean<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.540> about<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.960> way<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:10.000> he's<00:02:11.000> got

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
mean think about it that way so he's got

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.850 
mean think about it that way so he's got

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
step up to the plate and do what's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.210
