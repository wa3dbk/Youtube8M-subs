00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.000
 of the complete trilogy of hunters of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.099
 shadows the origins written by 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.840
 cassandra clare so the days I read 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.329
 the complete trilogy and now I want 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 talk about her because my mother 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.310
 the trilogy begins with mechanical angel 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.380
 continue with the mechanical prince and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.449
 ends with the unique and heartbreaking 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.830
 mechanical princess so I 'm going to 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.809
 tell a little bit the pretext with which 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 mechanical angel starts the novel is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.129
 located at the end of the year 1800 in the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.809
 Victorian England and that is that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 a young American woman who arrives in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.530
 boat to the city of london in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.330
 looks for his brother nate in the port and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.339
 pick up a good rather kidnapped 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.110
 for the dark sisters are these the 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.119
 the darkest they will do is torture him and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.339
 trainable so that you can be free 

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:58.290
 kind of hidden power that has because 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.479
 has aroused the interest of a person 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.519
 very very bad of the city that wants 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.559
 get the talent of that thanks to 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.570
 angel and never better said undo 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.979
 rescued by a group of hunters from 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.320
 shadows among those who are 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.580
 james and wil this trilogy of the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.500
 Shadowhunters will not have to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.939
 dealing with underground beings is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.600
 say although vampires are going to appear 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.670
 Wolfman 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.380
 the enemies of this trilogy as well 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 indicate the titles of the novel 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.369
 they are mechanical beings who have taken 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.049
 to the institute of london where they live 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.520
 these hunters of shadows not only 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.380
 will have to defend against the attacks of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.360
 these mechanical beings go up and hide 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.159
 of that evil being who wants to be 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.930
 with her but also have the great 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.270
 dilemma of who is she really and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.649
 Especially to whoever I want, I am going to talk to you 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.360
 first of the argument of the 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.950
 novel something that has surprised me and that 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.750
 at the same time I was very happy about that 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.009
 trilogy of origins is that the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.020
 Shadowhunters are already 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.340
 focused exclusively on the eternal 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.170
 fight between the nefilim and the 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.479
 underground since if there is not a 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.920
 new villain with his own army that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.390
 it goes out of the ordinary and that at the same 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.860
 time has made me last a long time 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.630
 era in which this is inspired 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 history has had me enough that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.659
 mix in the theme of the time 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.649
 Victorian with technological advances 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.179
 and scientists 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.159
 I found a great surprise 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.090
 combination and especially something very 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.830
 different from what we had 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.269
 accustomed casandra considered 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.160
 essential that for this casandra trilogy 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.299
 will completely change the record in 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.130
 as to the story because if not 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.780
 we would have more of the same and we always 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.100
 we can get bored I will teach you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.799
 how the princess theme ended 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.239
 mechanics was like that you already know that I do not 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.080
 point the books but princess 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.670
 mechanics 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 the penalty that was pointed this is 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.490
 possible is referred to two things 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.260
 first of all they are passages and 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.240
 Memorable comments from some of the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.610
 protagonists and curiously they are all 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.200
 the scenes in which I have cried I go to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 count the post-it one two three four 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.860
 five six seven moments of all the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.020
 novel of those who cry I have to 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.550
 confess that this novel was a non-stop 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.900
 to cry without any doubt at the end of 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.510
 mechanical princess at the end that trilogy 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.430
 It is absolutely epic gives many turns to 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.990
 the original saga has been one of the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.220
 best pilots I've seen in terms of 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.500
 youthful novel has surprised me 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.970
 quite honestly and then the part 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.580
 of the epilogue believe me I kept crying 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.290
 it's beautiful it's a perfect circle that 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.490
 Cassandra closed something that I admire 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.290
 enough of the way of writing of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.000
 Cassandra believe is the great intensity with 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.980
 the one that tells their stories that they keep 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.720
 tension in vilo during the 400 pages 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.190
 history makes it impossible for 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.959
 leave it and that's something pretty 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.610
 complicated to get though I 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.900
 I would like to highlight this trilogy is that 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.790
 there has been a big difference between the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.110
 content of the first volume and the second 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.790
 I take the first one we have focused 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.320
 enough to establish the bases of what 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.240
 was going to be the main argument of the 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.100
 trilogy in developing a little the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.360
 this plot to get into the mystery this 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.250
 however, I got the feeling that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.470
 the second shot distanced slightly 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.330
 of what the original plot would be 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.650
 in developing a bit of the context 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.270
 emotional of the characters 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.130
 I think maybe I do not consider it as something 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.230
 vital if after in mechanical princess 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.420
 I wanted to get that big cluster of 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.770
 emotions that dramatism this does not want 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.090
 say that the second novel focuses 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.830
 exclusively in the development 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.600
 emotional of the characters if there 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.950
 a continuity of the original plot of 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.840
 Roquetas is positioned in a second 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.610
 flat to try to get that great 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.140
 advance of the characters once you 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.120
 the basis of those they feel are the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.500
 protagonists of this new trilogy you 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.300
 realize that there is a great similarity 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.640
 between the three main protagonists 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.320
 of shadow hunters origins and 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.750
 the main saga of hunters of 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.250
 shadows because texas is still a 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.930
 clearly and totally helpless that 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.970
 you need protection but at the same time 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.550
 has a great hidden talent will follow 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.070
 being that haughty haughty james very 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.650
 cool and arrogant and james that 's the 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.930
 salmon this typical eternal friend very 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.609
 good person and with a noble heart that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.260
 would be sacrificed by anyone maybe 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.180
 that I saw these characters I said 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.860
 we are again with the same thing is going to be 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.960
 the same triangle I already know how it's going to 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.870
 work, I'm bored, hello 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.340
 the wave the wave the my surprise as soon as 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.169
 I began to read in depth the first 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.580
 I take in this trilogy I realized 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.470
 that I was quite wrong in that 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.940
 to the theme of the characters when I started 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.380
 to read shadow hunters the saga 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.880
 original the character of james me 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.740
 it called a lot of attention because it was 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.509
 the typical arrogant one who calls you the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.160
 attention and that hooks you however 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.660
 the character of will in the origins what 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.819
 I hated from the first page to 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.800
 practically the last pages of 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.539
 book and this is basically because I carry 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.360
 the third protagonist in discord of 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.190
 this triangle has been perfect if there was 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.990
 law of the trilogy of the origins you know 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.030
 that james has a future a little bit 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.530
 uncertain and it is precisely because of that 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.780
 weakness so it establishes a 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.490
 very deep connection with him and everything 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.110
 that he feels believe me that I have 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.120
 sense with him no I'm not going to 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.770
 highlight several characters in the first 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.000
 place I will talk about test what I 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.710
 like them that during all the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.509
 novels will try to discover who 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.460
 she really that is there is a 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.620
 sort of great girlfriend around her 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.240
 past of its history and especially of its 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.190
 future does not know who he is or where 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.599
 goes and I think that precisely 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.729
 confusion is what makes it a 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.500
 such an incredible character and especially the 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.360
 great turn that this character has 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.860
 during the last volume of the novel is 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.659
 absolutely incredible 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.400
 I'm going to applaud Cassandra Clare for the 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.960
 last chapters of mechanical princess 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.699
 twist temple that has three to during 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.520
 these last chapters belive that no 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.319
 you just wait and it's absolutely unique 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.449
 I think that during all the books of 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:52.300
 house where I read there was never 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.000
 found a character so well done 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.000
 like the dt or at least one character with 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.439
 who could feel so many things 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.259
 because during the three volumes of this 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.319
 trilogy thank you yesterday I laughed and cried 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.270
 to evils please and above all I have 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.139
 in love my heart has broken and I 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.699
 I fell in love again 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.729
 He is the typical friend that we would all like 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.199
 to have is noble is loyal is sincere is 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.449
 authentic and above all is so 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.310
 sacrificed so adorable so good 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.750
 person another reason for the 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.300
 which the characters of cassandra clare 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.129
 are so unique is that the author is capable 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.259
 to create secondary characters give them 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.060
 life such future and an outcome although 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.319
 sense emotional connections with will 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.430
 because they also happen enough 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.830
 interesting things throughout the 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.509
 novel it well character so extremely 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.550
 identical to James of the original saga 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.379
 This is why I joined the camp more 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.000
 james to the wild side by ending is 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.529
 teaches the only thing I want to tell you is 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.280
 that the trilogy of shadow hunters 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.740
 The origins 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.600
 under my point of view it is very much 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.250
 better than the original saga of hunters 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.020
 of shadows with a pretty argument 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.790
 original and with great script twists 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.169
 something of the three volumes with the 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.790
 very well thought characters with 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.100
 development and with big script twists 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.990
 and without any doubt with a shipment 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.240
 emotionally a thousand times greater than 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.740
 has the original ssa catán tyler have 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.389
 the curious ability to create novels 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.400
 tremendously addictive you will not be able to 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.500
 let them read mel on the three 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.660
 tomes in three days in fact he takes one 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.889
 and volume two I read it on the same day because 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.960
 it was absolutely impossible that 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.160
 will stop reading really they are very 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.810
 good big stories 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.490
