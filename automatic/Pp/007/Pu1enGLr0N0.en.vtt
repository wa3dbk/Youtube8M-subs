00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hello everyone today decided to do this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.370
 video Super makeshift cooling 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.700
 I have a processor installed here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.440
 intel core 2 processor up to 6 550 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:21.859
 overclocked to 4 gigahertz with voltage 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:25.170
 1.49 is under load test 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.990
 temperatures as seen at 43 44 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 degrees is here two core temperature 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 room around 30 degrees and grayson 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.719
 basically decent enough from what 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 same ways have it cool on 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.280
 compliance is clear what to lower 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.170
 for example the temperature in the room should 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 system and if there is no 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.820
 conditioner here so he shaves it yet 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 in an open test bench 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.590
 can increase the flow rate i.e. 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.890
 change cooler or add like this 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 here 2 color I took such a 90 millimeter 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.809
 About the speed of this cooler 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.280
 will be like this it rotates now on 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.070
 speeds of 2636 rpm is a cat 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 I put just like that on top of the cooler and oh 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 of course you can prisobachit for example 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.850
 ties so connect 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 three pin connector and so here it is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.259
 install and now we will 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.970
 look until how much is reduced now 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.310
 temperature as seen with the second 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.880
 fan temperature pavlov average 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.009
 somewhere to 64 and 65 degrees that is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 The result is at installation 2 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.170
 fan of course noise while doing too 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.210
 it is added but I did not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.320
 set because I have to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 a crazy idea but it did not put 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.079
 Here is such a fan that barely barely 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.759
 rotates by the way the sensor here is something 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.990
 lying like 2636 was and stayed on 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.340
 in fact, that's the speed of this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.040
 the fan should have increased 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.990
 because here this fan should 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.659
 disperse this air stream 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 a fan that stands below well yes not 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.259
 the essence is important and what did I decide to do for 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.040
 such a collective farm super where to put it 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.440
 here is such 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.470
 high-speed glacialtech fan 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.560
 here so on top of him prisobachit but for 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.930
 more efficiency I will put more 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.989
 one fan is like that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.900
 in general, such a multicultural madness 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.030
 and what will I do? 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.450
 fix I fix it like this 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.459
 Ties and take the usual nylon 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 screeds and here in this hole here where 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.239
 screws are inserted stretched these here 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.400
 screeds but now I'll show you installed 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.650
 I have all this too much talent madness 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.100
 four fans are working now 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.870
 the temperature dropped by one visible core 58 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.580
 degrees by 2 jumps 5253 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.040
 There is a result when installing all these 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.620
 fans but be honest 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.690
 the results are not very big already 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.760
 noise while completely unacceptable I 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.130
 dropped just a couple of degrees you can 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.019
 state that more than two 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.799
 fans here already have a special meaning 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.170
 no 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.350
 I think the problem is in the radiator since it 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.900
 aluminum and does not have time just from 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.700
 quickly give heat know that 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.530
 aluminum does not possess such a good 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.900
 thermal conductivity as you can see i think that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.870
 if there was a copper radiator then 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.510
 the result would be better well by the way yes 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.100
 shut i fastened here here nylon 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.400
 ties that is it is even possible 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.870
 put in the case and it will hold 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.420
 I hope it was useful to someone like that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.530
 temporary solution when urgently needed 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.049
 Led summer heat your hot tsipka 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.470
 well thank you all for watching everyone 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.470
 until
