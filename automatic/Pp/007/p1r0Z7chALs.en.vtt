so<00:00:01.350> here's<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> MacBook<00:00:02.040> Air<00:00:02.280> with<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> busted

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
so here's a MacBook Air with a busted

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.780 
so here's a MacBook Air with a busted
hinge<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.419> it<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:04.009> just<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.160> little<00:00:05.430> kind

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hinge here it is just this little kind

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.500 
hinge here it is just this little kind
of<00:00:05.879> metal<00:00:06.210> clip<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.200> here's<00:00:07.589> what<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.950> new

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
of metal clip and here's what the new

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.030 
of metal clip and here's what the new
ones<00:00:09.510> look<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.719> they're<00:00:10.050> not<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.349> identical

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
ones look like they're not an identical

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.600 
ones look like they're not an identical
match<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.580> then<00:00:11.880> again<00:00:13.460> doesn't<00:00:14.460> really

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
match but then again doesn't really

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.990 
match but then again doesn't really
matter<00:00:14.880> because<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:16.020> original<00:00:17.000> equipment

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
matter because the original equipment

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.450 
matter because the original equipment
was<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> piece<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.600> junk<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.080> maybe<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
was a piece of junk so maybe this is a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.300 
was a piece of junk so maybe this is a
little<00:00:20.670> better<00:00:20.820> couldn't<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.390> much<00:00:21.539> worse

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
little better couldn't be much worse

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.500 
little better couldn't be much worse
anyway<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.670> they<00:00:23.760> look<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
anyway that's what they look like you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
anyway that's what they look like you
can<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> pair<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> them<00:00:25.680> online<00:00:25.859> pretty

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
can get a pair of them online pretty

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.570 
can get a pair of them online pretty
cheap<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:28.109> take<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:29.130> panel<00:00:29.460> off

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
cheap so you take the back panel off

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.160 
cheap so you take the back panel off
this<00:00:29.760> isn't<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.179> whole<00:00:30.330> tutorial<00:00:30.720> I'm<00:00:30.960> just

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
this isn't a whole tutorial I'm just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.069 
this isn't a whole tutorial I'm just
giving<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:32.090> pointers<00:00:33.090> take<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> back

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
giving you some pointers take the back

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.500 
giving you some pointers take the back
panel<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.340> Phillips<00:00:35.820> screws<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
panel off with the Phillips screws and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
panel off with the Phillips screws and
then<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.520> disconnect<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.170> wire<00:00:40.469> here

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
then you can disconnect this wire here

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.490 
then you can disconnect this wire here
it's<00:00:40.890> pinned<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> screw<00:00:42.110> this<00:00:43.110> wire

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's pinned down with a screw this wire

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's pinned down with a screw this wire
here<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.950> pinned<00:00:44.190> down<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> screw<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
here it's pinned down with a screw and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.729 
here it's pinned down with a screw and
it<00:00:46.590> gives<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.309> room<00:00:47.719> then<00:00:48.739> under

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it gives you some more room then under

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.229 
it gives you some more room then under
this<00:00:49.920> piece<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.340> plastic<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.049 
this piece of plastic you're going to
see<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:51.960> screws<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:53.059> take

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
see all these little screws here take

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
see all these little screws here take
these<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.750> take<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.260> first

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
these are the hinge screws they are big

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
these are the hinge screws they are big
the<00:01:00.449> bigger<00:01:00.660> black<00:01:00.930> ones<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.170> see

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
the bigger black ones and you can see
it's<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> star<00:01:05.040> shape<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.850> use<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's like a star shape I just use a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
it's like a star shape I just use a
flathead<00:01:06.420> driver<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> still<00:01:07.560> works<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
flathead driver on that it still works I

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
flathead driver on that it still works I
can<00:01:08.040> buy<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> special<00:01:08.850> tool<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:10.409> used

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
can buy a special tool I just used

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.450 
can buy a special tool I just used
Phillips<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> flat<00:01:11.640> heads<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> these

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
Phillips and flat heads for all of these

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
Phillips and flat heads for all of these
anyway<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.520> here's<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.390> hinge<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> I'm

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
anyway so here's the hinge that I'm

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.100 
anyway so here's the hinge that I'm
slipping<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.540> get<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> fit<00:01:19.229> over<00:01:20.030> this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
slipping on and get it to fit over this

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.450 
slipping on and get it to fit over this
metal<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.259> sticking<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> little

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
metal that's sticking out it's a little

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.130 
metal that's sticking out it's a little
difficult<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.509> filed<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:26.689> this<00:01:27.689> edge<00:01:29.060> here

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
difficult so I filed down this edge here

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
difficult so I filed down this edge here
just<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.130> opening<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.000> bit

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
just to make the opening a little bit

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
just to make the opening a little bit
bigger<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.189> four<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.310> slip<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.939> can

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
bigger for the four to slip on you can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
bigger for the four to slip on you can
see<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> shape<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.790> it's

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
see the shape that's not just like it's

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.810 
see the shape that's not just like it's
a<00:01:39.150> circle<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:43.820> little

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a circle it's you know like a little

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.109 
a circle it's you know like a little
fishy<00:01:45.299> crackers<00:01:45.540> shape<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:47.180> or<00:01:48.180> pot

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
fishy crackers shape see that or pot

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.289 
fishy crackers shape see that or pot
anyway

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
anyway

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.969 
anyway
so<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.750> pushing<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:53.869> like<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.170> just

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so I'm pushing it on like this just

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
so I'm pushing it on like this just
putting<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> part<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.630> screwdriver<00:01:59.630> in

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
putting this part of the screwdriver in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.350 
putting this part of the screwdriver in
that<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.740> hole<00:02:02.659> there's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.810> push<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:05.360> wiggle

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that little hole there's a push I wiggle

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.649 
that little hole there's a push I wiggle
it<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
it like that

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.490 
it like that
and<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.380> helps<00:02:08.890> push<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.000> on<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:12.130> rod<00:02:12.370> there

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and it helps push it on to the rod there

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.800 
and it helps push it on to the rod there
anyway<00:02:14.500> that's<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.250> I'm<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.810> put

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
anyway that's it so I'm going to put

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.250 
anyway that's it so I'm going to put
this<00:02:16.930> back<00:02:17.110> together<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.940> let's<00:02:18.940> see<00:02:19.330> how<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
this back together and let's see how it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:54.830 
this back together and let's see how it
works
