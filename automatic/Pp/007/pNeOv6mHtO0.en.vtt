00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.070 

we<00:02:01.470> will<00:02:01.560> metal<00:02:02.390> stand<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.690> kind<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
we will metal stand this kind of

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.969 
we will metal stand this kind of
vibration<00:02:04.770> had<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> engineers<00:02:06.590> realized<00:02:07.590> how

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
vibration had the engineers realized how

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
vibration had the engineers realized how
this<00:02:08.190> thing<00:02:08.429> shakes<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> shakes<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this thing shakes because it shakes and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
this thing shakes because it shakes and
vibrates<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:11.940> than<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.540> ever

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
vibrates so much more than I ever

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:36.320 
vibrates so much more than I ever
imagined<00:02:29.330> sound<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:35.010> shakes<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.880> whole<00:02:36.000> body

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
imagined sound it shakes the whole body

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
imagined sound it shakes the whole body
of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.570> reverberations<00:02:37.410> from<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:37.950> very

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
of the reverberations from it it's very

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.690 
of the reverberations from it it's very
emotional<00:02:41.090> you're<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.450> riding<00:02:42.690> along<00:02:42.959> a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
emotional you're not just riding along a

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.040 
emotional you're not just riding along a
lot<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.820> people<00:02:45.120> think<00:02:45.390> you're<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.570> lying<00:02:45.959> on

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
lot of people think you're just lying on

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.780 
lot of people think you're just lying on
your<00:02:46.110> back<00:02:46.380> waiting<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> happen<00:02:47.430> but

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
your back waiting for it to happen but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.960 
your back waiting for it to happen but
not<00:02:48.480> really<00:02:48.870> because<00:02:49.410> every<00:02:50.040> second<00:02:50.519> is

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
not really because every second is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.180 
not really because every second is
something<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.019> significance<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:55.010> found<00:02:56.010> out

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
something of significance I found out

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.250 
something of significance I found out
from<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.489> flight<00:02:56.730> surgeon<00:02:57.239> later<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:58.080> my

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
from the flight surgeon later on that my

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.000 
from the flight surgeon later on that my
heartbeat<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> hundred<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.730> forty-four

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
heartbeat was a hundred and forty-four

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.490 
heartbeat was a hundred and forty-four
at<00:03:02.010> liftoff<00:03:03.860> John

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.920 

yeah<00:03:07.650> well<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.550> told<00:03:08.940> him<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.180> said<00:03:09.360> mine<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:09.750> too

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
yeah well I told him I said mine is too

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.200 
yeah well I told him I said mine is too
old<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.350> any<00:03:10.500> faster<00:03:11.070> yeah<00:03:13.730> why<00:03:14.730> did<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.030> do

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
old to go any faster yeah why did we do

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.080 
old to go any faster yeah why did we do
all<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.630> launch<00:03:15.990> simulation<00:03:16.920> if<00:03:17.490> I<00:03:17.760> had<00:03:17.910> had

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
all the launch simulation if I had had

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.610 
all the launch simulation if I had had
to<00:03:18.240> reach<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.570> switch<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:19.140> all<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
to reach a switch with all of that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.380 
to reach a switch with all of that
vibration<00:03:19.800> going<00:03:20.400> on<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.640> wouldn't<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.150> quite

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
vibration going on I wouldn't have quite

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.720 
vibration going on I wouldn't have quite
been<00:03:21.690> sure<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.290> where<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.590> was<00:03:22.860> putting<00:03:23.190> my<00:03:23.340> hand

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.750 

we<00:03:30.300> were<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:30.930> our<00:03:31.260> way<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:34.040> had<00:03:35.040> control<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.670> that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
we were on our way I had control of that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.229 
we were on our way I had control of that
vehicle<00:03:36.090> right<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.750> palm<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.170> my<00:03:37.290> hand<00:03:38.239> but

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
vehicle right in the palm of my hand but

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.759 
vehicle right in the palm of my hand but
the<00:03:39.390> guidance<00:03:39.780> failed<00:03:40.110> our<00:03:40.349> starting<00:03:40.709> to

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
the guidance failed our starting to

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.619 
the guidance failed our starting to
destroy<00:03:40.950> or<00:03:41.370> went<00:03:41.580> somewhere<00:03:41.970> we<00:03:42.180> didn't<00:03:42.450> like

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
destroy or went somewhere we didn't like

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.540 
destroy or went somewhere we didn't like
her<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.870> ground<00:03:43.110> in<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.769> could<00:03:44.250> flip<00:03:44.489> a

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
her to ground in like I could flip a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.960 
her to ground in like I could flip a
switch<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.690> could<00:03:45.930> control<00:03:46.349> seven<00:03:46.970> over

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
switch and I could control seven over

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.400 
switch and I could control seven over
seven<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> half<00:03:48.420> million<00:03:48.870> pounds<00:03:49.080> of

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
the thing that the moon myself and I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.360 
the thing that the moon myself and I
guarantee<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.709> practiced<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.099> trained

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
guarantee it I practiced it and trained

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.960 
guarantee it I practiced it and trained
for<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.030> many<00:03:57.180> times<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.840> almost<00:03:58.739> dared<00:03:59.549> I

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
for it so many times I almost dared I

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.080 
for it so many times I almost dared I
almost<00:04:00.540> dared<00:04:00.930> her<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.200> quit<00:04:01.500> on<00:04:01.680> me<00:04:05.090> every

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
almost dared her to quit on me every

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.270 
almost dared her to quit on me every
breath<00:04:06.390> she<00:04:06.540> breathed<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.560> breathed<00:04:07.890> with<00:04:08.130> her

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
breath she breathed I breathed with her

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.789 
breath she breathed I breathed with her
she<00:04:08.670> was<00:04:08.880> she<00:04:09.599> was<00:04:09.720> uniquely<00:04:10.319> something

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
she was she was uniquely something

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.670 
she was she was uniquely something
special<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.610> what<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:11.970> hell<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.510> ride<00:04:12.720> she

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
special and what a hell of a ride she

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:41.100 
special and what a hell of a ride she
gave

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.559 

we<00:04:41.680> had<00:04:41.830> been<00:04:42.009> warned<00:04:42.520> about<00:04:42.669> shutdown<00:04:43.300> with

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
we had been warned about shutdown with

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.210 
we had been warned about shutdown with
the<00:04:43.689> Saturn<00:04:44.139> because<00:04:44.409> you<00:04:44.560> go<00:04:44.680> from<00:04:44.919> four<00:04:45.099> and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
the Saturn because you go from four and

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.249 

this<00:04:50.520> big<00:04:50.819> fireball<00:04:52.219> comes<00:04:53.219> roaring<00:04:54.259> the

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
this big fireball comes roaring the

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.389 
this big fireball comes roaring the
length<00:04:55.499> of<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.830> booster<00:04:57.919> and<00:04:58.919> just<00:04:59.159> out

00:04:59.389 --> 00:04:59.399 
length of that booster and just out

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.279 
length of that booster and just out
front<00:04:59.879> you<00:04:59.999> then<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> second<00:05:00.689> stage<00:05:00.869> fires

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
front you then the second stage fires

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:55.540 
front you then the second stage fires
and<00:05:01.949> you<00:05:02.219> fly<00:05:02.430> right<00:05:02.610> through<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:03.089> fireball

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.880 

you<00:05:56.550> go<00:05:56.760> up<00:05:56.850> in<00:05:57.000> Earth<00:05:57.150> orbit<00:05:57.450> and<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.710> go

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
you go up in Earth orbit and you go

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.910 
you go up in Earth orbit and you go
around<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.400> earth<00:05:59.520> once<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:01.320> again<00:06:01.440> that's<00:06:01.770> a

around the earth once and again that's a

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.430 
around the earth once and again that's a
busy<00:06:02.250> time<00:06:02.490> because<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.660> want<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.020> make<00:06:04.170> sure
