00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi how are you today we are going to see one of 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.390
 the favorite scales of viking in this 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.340
 class among the notes that usually play 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.950
 on this scale today we're going to see a couple of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 ideas to get this classic sound 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.200
 we are going to touch the third position of the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.200
 minor penta 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.300
 and we are going to add the fifth flat 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.770
 first rope sixth rope 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.840
 and the ninth major 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.770
 sixth major and third major all this 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.770
 together sounds like this 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.620
 sounds very viking let's see a couple of 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 ideas to get a good sound 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.180
 first one sector that I like a lot is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.770
 this group of three notes formed by the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.260
 sixth and the tonic 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.400
 the ninth major because many melodies 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.400
 can leave from there 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.390
 i 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 until they saw that stretched a lot is the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 ninth greater than when stretching it approaches 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.280
 somewhere near the third largest 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.090
 and as we said before it is very 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.090
 important 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.470
 Y 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.030
 something that is quite viking is jumping 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.500
 from the fifth in this case is my and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.390
 is on the 12th fret of the first 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.390
 direct cord towards the tonic 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.750
 and to solve sentences two notes that I 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.850
 They like the tonic and the ninth 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.310
 greater than actually we are going to stretch 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.750
 to get to the third way and solve 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.750
 in the sound of the third motion 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 i 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.329
 let's see how all this sounds about a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.329
 blues 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.769
 Y 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.769
 Y 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.850
 if you like class do not forget 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.290
 subscribe any doubt I can 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.770
 leave on facebook and see you next 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.770
 class 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.970
 all right 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.050
 i
