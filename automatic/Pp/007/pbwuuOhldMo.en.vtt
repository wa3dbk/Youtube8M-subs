00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.170
 hello my little malicious intruder 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.500
 traffic regulations 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.439
 today I will show you something about what you even 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.630
 didn't guess i'll show you how 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 way you need to move on all of us 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.480
 famous viaducts in los santos 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.770
 so first of all let's consider leaving 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 los santos on the track to las venturas 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 usually you are my little friend 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.620
 turn left and drive out 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 oncoming traffic 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.690
 you don't even care what's possible from there 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.109
 rushing some will be on huge 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.929
 speed and chance of collision will be 90 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.839
 percent damage the car in both 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.329
 what is the maximum you can save 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.969
 three four seconds think whether it is worth 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 for the sake of four seconds to arrange a head-on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.360
 clash i think not now 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 it's time to change your worldview 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 and the correct system is open to you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 movements on this viaducts we go on our own 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.439
 strip and rebuild a little bit 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.649
 to the right 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.130
 the road leads us to the arc which 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.100
 will lead you to the very road that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.299
 lead to las venturas you see how it all 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.759
 just if you don't believe me, come on 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.119
 look at the single san andreas 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.140
 see how cars are moving so should 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.390
 move and you and your friends are sure 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 pass this video so they never 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.320
 got into an accident 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.200
 now let's imagine that you 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 come back from 20 venturas but you 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.280
 need not to center object 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 accordingly you need to turn 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 to the left and here you are again doing a maneuver with 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.179
 violation of departure into the oncoming lane as 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.060
 I have already said it is fraught with consequences 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.750
 let's see how to properly 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 turn on 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.530
 and again you observe how simple it is and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.440
 safe and most importantly losing all the same 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.470
 four seconds for today 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.569
 my young offender next issue we 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.550
 Consider traffic near the City Hall 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.170
 be sure to subscribe not to 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.110
 skip new lesson 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.110
 it is very important for you good luck
