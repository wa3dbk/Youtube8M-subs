00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.660
 so hello to everyone themselves fake 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.599
 and today I would like to 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.309
 tell how to create server cs 1 6 so 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.369
 go to a website called science and 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.599
 erased point ru so go to home 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:26.439
 and as we see, here are six such as otherwise 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.970
 here it is written hosting servers ks16 here 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.080
 counter strike source 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.210
 here resource all there 16 assemblies there 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.250
 finely and here in this case we will 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.350
 order counter strike 1 6 our series 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.500
 so here we see here you can read 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.200
 that's how we see on the gray servers will be 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.250
 protected as units free features 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.329
 paid here so the features here are the muscles 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.420
 read the information so here it is 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.500
 let's go to the order form as 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.770
 see our order number from 39200 391 we 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.810
 copy it somewhere I remember there 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.130
 can silently water the code document into the computer 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.729
 and somewhere either phone so this one it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.630
 need to be kept here on the number 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.570
 ordering a referral so location 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.210
 here we have one location every day 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.399
 We are updated and the location that is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.950
 closer mike from the location 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:34.060
 so we will have less ping so with 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 text north here is our server stage 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.009
 and here's a digital one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.250
 that's why you we can go to 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.500
 the service is easier with a slot in this 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.509
 the default case of us is 10 that is one 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.490
 a slot is one man i mean one jacks 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.710
 you can go north in this case 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.000
 there are 10 of us here that we can go to 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.090
 server we can also do 32 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 but as much as you like to see them 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.490
 below is the price of the slot 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.039
 expenses per day consumption per month of juice wave 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.009
 will want a month can also change 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.800
 check here for Belarus's how 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.060
 see here 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.410
 and the euro in rubles but that sort of thing well at 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.330
 creating this one there 15 apart at a time 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.030
 show series will spin up 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.520
 so much money is not a loss so 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.950
 privacy that is what 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.430
 privacy consolidated for all or photo 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.880
 password 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.610
 that is, when we go north 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.930
 we can either go in just like that 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.300
 above we go either only with a password here 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.120
 so thousand fps so we tick a photo 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.470
 by access we do not mark indicate our 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.360
 skype or secu 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:03.950
 I write my first skype on 98 and 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:05.300
 sometimes orders repeat so here we are 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.420
 came up with your order number 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.420
 That's fine and enter the code from the image 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.630
 that's the principle we all did all of us 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.290
 it was required we kept the code picture all 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.489
 We remember, and how this is how we see the price of the slot 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.630
 see all 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.950
 the host is so cheap principle ok 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.700
 so click order form 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.270
 but I will not I already had the server 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.310
 just created so now remember 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.800
 our order form 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.950
 here he is now i will walk 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.320
 the other one created as we see 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:55.580
 order number and specify your password 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:57.560
 which we have specified click log in here 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.770
 as we see the control panel 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:06.200
 we went to the control panel as 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:09.260
 see in the information here so here's NATO 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.830
 By ordering a rental day 1 one example 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.980
 ends here a month has passed and you are not there 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.310
 have time to pay and can be divided by 3 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.150
 of the day 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.120
 rent like this if u don't have time there 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.690
 something so order number here is our type 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.750
 order 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.540
 here's the balance of us until we push zero 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:37.070
 install server is installing gray 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:39.590
 wait a couple of minutes so let's go this way 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.360
 see set the styller everything is fine 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.750
 so now the balance will need to replenish 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.720
 balance 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.410
 so that we still worked here we press 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.990
 top up and what payment methods 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.600
 webmoney kevin here we enter the amount 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.650
 click to pay 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:04.910
 here everything is clear so go free 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.020
 not with the north so here we can start 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.240
 map select dust2 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.150
 that's how we see here we are offered 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:17.120
 so many cards we can specify your card 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.720
 as he sees the password as you can see 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.530
 we can remove our school password 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.160
 here that without code as it is the same 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.650
 slots that's how slots privacy 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.650
 so well there and all passed 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.970
 autorun here we can read it 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.930
 mow a booster sketch 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.560
 if it's off so here we are all 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.030
 it is clear so what is the admin server come 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.720
 for work will remain her must be 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:53.720
 then enabled series service and 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.870
 the vodka see us lack balance 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.210
 and photo balance 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.390
 but nothing principle I showed as 100 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.510
 I think the server will be all clear here 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.950
 if we can contact technical support 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.460
 here you want to write here 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.840
 their problem and technical support necessary 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.150
 help, in principle, I told everything how 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:21.919
 make server 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:24.470
