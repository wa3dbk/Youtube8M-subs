00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and honestly to me he looks a little

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.230 
and honestly to me he looks a little
bland<00:02:04.710> originally<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> even<00:02:05.939> thought<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
bland originally I even thought the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
bland originally I even thought the
Japanese<00:02:06.689> version<00:02:07.110> looked<00:02:07.380> very<00:02:07.770> bland<00:02:08.250> he's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
Japanese version looked very bland he's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940 
Japanese version looked very bland he's
just<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.090> grey<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:10.410> has<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> shark

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
just kind of this grey he has a shark

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.440 
just kind of this grey he has a shark
motif<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> guess<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.060> into<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
motif and I guess if you're into that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.240 
motif and I guess if you're into that
he'll<00:02:12.750> look<00:02:12.900> pretty<00:02:13.319> cool<00:02:13.770> but

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
he'll look pretty cool but

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300 
he'll look pretty cool but
me<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.180> boring<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:15.960> his<00:02:16.500> gimmick<00:02:16.890> here

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
me it's just boring now his gimmick here

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.810 
me it's just boring now his gimmick here
is<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:18.800> grip<00:02:19.800> back<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.460> you're<00:02:20.610> supposed

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
is this grip back here you're supposed

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.670 
is this grip back here you're supposed
to<00:02:20.850> be<00:02:20.970> able<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.180> hold<00:02:21.690> them<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:21.870> one<00:02:22.080> hand

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
to be able to hold them with one hand

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.330 
to be able to hold them with one hand
hence<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.880> side<00:02:24.330> core<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.740> if<00:02:26.040> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
hence the one side core but if you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.980 
hence the one side core but if you
remember<00:02:27.140> chrome<00:02:28.140> Zephyr<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:30.060> blast<00:02:30.510> arm

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
remember chrome Zephyr and the blast arm

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.170 
remember chrome Zephyr and the blast arm
