00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello and welcome to the giga 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.299
 trivia it is the following eur 51 and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.740
 I want to get started before it starts 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.450
 we are getting big 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.679
 Treviso are a bit rebuild 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.719
 We would like to have a look 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.460
 more on big things focus 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 but then take a bit longer 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.029
 the declared time comes from therefore 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.500
 so a little bit of this always ten facts 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.910
 systems changed a bit 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 but that does not do that for so long 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.820
 we still remain interesting and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.199
 I hope that is the case and now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 first have fun in our triforce 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.300
 We start today with a little something 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.529
 sad but at the same time 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.930
 entertaining story for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 action game no more heroes than that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 wanted title in 2007 appeared in japan 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 producer yasuhiro wada and game 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 designers or fifty one fans 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 make a small gift for it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 they marched unannounced in one 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.010
 Video game shop where we give there 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.480
 not only the game but also 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.969
 signed no more heroes 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.309
 toilet paper or wise like this 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.719
 whole action because of a workday and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.199
 According to that , nothing big in the book 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.239
 business 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.070
 broke after less than half an hour 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 this action then again but 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.680
 the video production at somehow during 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 the development of the ego-shooter 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 goldeneye 007 you experimented with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 with some ideas at least in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 Listen to the theory creatively 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 For example, it was thought that one to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 Reload your choice for the advice pack 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.750
 had to remove and insert again 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.520
 That should be so for the player 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 feel like he's ammunition 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 you are sure to change the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.250
 Disadvantage of this story recognizes because 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 at a shooter for new balls each 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.650
 time to fiddle with a controller 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.299
 It's not the best idea among you 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 he is sure one or the other 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.720
 zelda fan who claims to be 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.640
 to know a lot about the series 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890
 but you also know the name of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 villains like to actually village 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 This name appears only once 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.890
 on and in the manual to sms lager 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.939
 link to the past with pleasure on dirt maria 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.770
 that may not sound like that right now 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 sumptuous as expected we will tell you now 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 Also why the name is American 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.710
 translation team from nintendo too 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.060
 they are responsible for the game one more 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.950
 wanted to give own touch 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.600
 what has been thought of in Japan 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.820
 we can only guess but fakt 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.569
 since then no longer know a surname 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.670
 got in the development of the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.290
 Super Nintendo has a thing for Nintendo 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.300
 in front of these many owners of the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.270
 predecessor console nds would have been pleased 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 complete backward compatibility that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.690
 would have been just over 800 games 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.459
 which I as an additional 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.709
 Sale argument on paper damned 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.590
 Well, the flip side was the but 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.080
 additional costs you would have fun that it about 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.239
 $ 75 more expensive and that one 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.730
 interna then too sensitive but with 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.319
 sega and not competition was there 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.030
 an expensive sale price not so good 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.890
 just like with consoles 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.239
 Developments are the xbox one has it 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.280
 not so easy in the past year 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.849
 had it on microsoft, however, too 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.709
 blame yourself 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.060
 where do you see that you black box but 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.370
 not always as we are now 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.050
 know there were a variety of prototypes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.470
 which developed during the design phase 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.120
 were 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.250
 below that are found next to the usual 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.260
 box shape also very extravagant 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.209
 The amazingly creative copies 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.739
 what a shame that the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.739
 Most of these designs in any 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.269
 drawers disappear 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.910
 Here you can see the intro sequence of tomb 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.910
 raider legend for the playstation 2 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.910
 gives 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.860
 and now we turn to the xbox 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.860
 version 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.620
 no that is not a technical defect 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.270
 because on the microsoft console gets 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.980
 you just can not see this video 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.870
 Now we have technical background 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.940
 or even censorship thinks that lies wrong 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.560
 because in this case, the developers have 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.360
 in the final version of the game 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.650
 Just forget about the intro video 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.480
 to pack on the dvd 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.950
 Unfortunately this is only after the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.670
 certification by microsoft 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.410
 noticed 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.850
 if you play something after that 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.860
 would have wanted to change then you would have 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.300
 play again check that what must 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.940
 messed up the schedule 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.870
 So then I would prefer no video 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.790
 a story ran stupidly 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.890
 also with a final acceptance 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.800
 had to do is from this game 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.110
 The fm like game appeared in 1995 for the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.880
 3d and a mixture of doubt 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.860
 horror and puzzle adventure and it 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.140
 partly contained pretty hard scenes 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.790
 author and director akin gino had 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.620
 But that's why you think of something 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.570
 approaching publication in the usa 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.459
 he feared that the game would be strong 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.660
 would have to be censored at all 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.370
 to get clearance 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.110
 To prevent that, he decided 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.000
 to a pretty daring action 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.950
 he produced an extremely cut 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.690
 version that got along without violence and 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.370
 she submitted this to the exam 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.530
 then he personally went to the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.730
 usa on the final version at 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.500
 press shop 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.000
 because of the flight he exchanged the now 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.160
 cut version easily with the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.260
 uncut version and so on 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.360
 the uncut version makes its way to the shops 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.790
 how big the trouble can be there afterwards 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.200
 we only suspect 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.730
 Finally , we clarify you over 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.220
 the historical origin of the trifle 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.110
 from the zelda row on admitted that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.060
 sounds like an extensive task 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.650
 we still have a few minutes that 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.450
 Triforce is not just since 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.390
 first country game but already since 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.950
 more than 1000 years existed in Japan 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.020
 between the twelfth and thirteenth 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.610
 century the who clear to this 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.160
 time also the political superpower 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.210
 Created the sign of the highlands was 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.580
 that with sudoku 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.830
 each of the three corners stands for one 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.960
 deity from the shinto one in japan 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.790
 widespread religion the 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.230
 dreieck form was the legend that 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.060
 a dragon in the fulfillment of a 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.310
 Desired lost three golden scales 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.900
 So the coat of arms has one in Japan 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.910
 historical meaning and it 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.710
 correspondingly very widespread it 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.940
 There are even some films that symbolize her 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.590
 use as a logo 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.210
 but that does not explain why 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.190
 nintendo the sign four games 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.200
 used or 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.150
 Certainly Nintendo has the triforce 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.370
 with the cultural meaning behind the head 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.930
 However, it uses very offshoot of 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.850
 series not really in Japanese 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.830
 mythology settled but he plays 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.810
 in a classic middle age fantasy 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.000
 world and also link has a strong 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.500
 western influence the clothes like to 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.600
 example very close to Peter pan 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.520
 but as in any good adventure 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.350
 gets something to do in the 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.200
 soul series , it is just the collecting of 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.060
 strength in the end to defeat the evil or 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.310
 strikeforce summarizes this task 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.140
 wonderful together because only if it is 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.790
 completely no peace is at rest 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.960
 to rule 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.150
 So now have clarified where from 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.120
 mighty mighty triforce comes out there 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.560
 but even more, for example the successes 52 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.670
 you can find them down there or on the 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.180
 other side not at all certain new 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.700
 final battle 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.930
 It's all about total song I can always do it 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.400
 do not talk straight but that does not matter 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.870
 I do not need that coach yet 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.360
 you go yourself otherwise there is 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.400
 against it even gameplay to enemy front 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.800
 a shooter in the second world war 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.270
 is different then under then it still works 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.830
 to the gigaset also great and now 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.160
 Maybe that 's why it's increasing 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.160
 false
