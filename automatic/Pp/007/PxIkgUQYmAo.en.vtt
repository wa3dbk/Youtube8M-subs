my<00:01:41.610> own<00:01:41.909> deoxys<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.659> death<00:01:42.899> fodder<00:01:43.170> even<00:01:43.950> bring

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
my own deoxys as death fodder even bring

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.940 
my own deoxys as death fodder even bring
him<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.790> want<00:01:45.240> something<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.770> take

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
him in when I want something not to take

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
him in when I want something not to take
a<00:01:46.979> hit<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> I'll<00:01:47.729> let<00:01:47.880> him<00:01:48.000> take<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> hip

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
a hit and I'll let him take the hip

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
a hit and I'll let him take the hip
since<00:01:48.659> his<00:01:48.810> own<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.110> gonna<00:01:49.259> die<00:01:49.439> anyways<00:01:49.829> but

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
since his own was gonna die anyways but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.710 
since his own was gonna die anyways but
he<00:01:50.579> actually<00:01:50.729> sets<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> stealth<00:01:51.450> rocks

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
he actually sets up a stealth rocks

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109 
he actually sets up a stealth rocks
which<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.070> whatever<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.640> expected

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
which is you know whatever I expected

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.389 
which is you know whatever I expected
him<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> bring<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.130> gray

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
him to do that but I bring in my gray

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.219 
him to do that but I bring in my gray
bull<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.119> actually<00:01:57.390> faster<00:01:57.750> than<00:01:57.990> his

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
bull which is actually faster than his

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.630 
bull which is actually faster than his
deoxys<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> choice<00:01:59.310> scarf

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
deoxys because I have a choice scarf

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
deoxys because I have a choice scarf
which<00:02:00.020> multiplies<00:02:01.020> speed<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.409> fifty<00:02:01.590> percent

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
which multiplies speed by fifty percent

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.830 
which multiplies speed by fifty percent
and<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> excess<00:02:03.600> ER<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and I'm gonna go for the excess ER and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260 
and I'm gonna go for the excess ER and
take<00:02:04.079> him<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> great<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.119> me

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
take him out so that is great for me

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
take him out so that is great for me
he's<00:02:06.840> gonna<00:02:06.960> switch<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.439> his<00:02:07.560> ferrothorn

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
he's gonna switch that to his ferrothorn

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
he's gonna switch that to his ferrothorn
now<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.270> he<00:02:09.330> saw<00:02:09.599> my<00:02:09.750> team<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.289> I

now and I know that he saw my team and I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.650 
now and I know that he saw my team and I
that<00:02:10.709> he<00:02:10.800> knows<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.490> magnezone<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that he knows that I have a magnezone so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.699 
that he knows that I have a magnezone so
I<00:02:12.690> know<00:02:12.810> he's<00:02:12.990> going<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> predict<00:02:13.500> me<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
I know he's going to predict me to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.650 
I know he's going to predict me to
switch<00:02:13.860> into<00:02:14.069> my<00:02:14.340> magnezone<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.090> strapping

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
knowing what move he's gonna lock

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.240 
knowing what move he's gonna lock
himself<00:02:33.450> into<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.709> because<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.100> I'm

for<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> u-turn<00:02:42.080> knowing<00:02:43.080> full<00:02:43.410> well<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.560> i

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
for the u-turn knowing full well that i

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.840 
for the u-turn knowing full well that i
could<00:02:43.860> take<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> u-turn<00:02:44.250> i'm<00:02:44.519> actually<00:02:44.640> gonna

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
could take a u-turn i'm actually gonna

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.360 
could take a u-turn i'm actually gonna
go<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.239> fiery<00:02:45.450> punch<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.890> made<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> huge

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
go for the fiery punch and I made a huge

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
go for the fiery punch and I made a huge
mistake<00:02:47.489> here<00:02:47.910> because<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> predicted<00:02:48.720> him<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
mistake here because I predicted him to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
mistake here because I predicted him to
switch<00:02:49.470> into<00:02:49.590> his<00:02:49.800> ferrothorn<00:02:50.130> or<00:02:50.580> his

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
switch into his ferrothorn or his

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.490 
switch into his ferrothorn or his
reuniclus<00:02:52.040> because<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.870> thought<00:02:55.170> he<00:02:55.380> would

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
reuniclus because I I thought he would

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.710 
reuniclus because I I thought he would
think<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.860> would<00:02:55.950> go<00:02:56.069> for<00:02:56.100> super<00:02:56.489> power

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
think that I would go for super power

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.330 
think that I would go for super power
but<00:02:57.720> he<00:02:57.900> actually<00:02:58.110> brings<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.560> his<00:02:58.680> tyranitar

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
but he actually brings in his tyranitar

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.699 
but he actually brings in his tyranitar
so<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.790> full<00:03:00.690> effect<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.230> really<00:03:01.500> should

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
so in full effect that really should

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.949 
so in full effect that really should
have<00:03:01.800> went<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.250> super<00:03:02.459> power<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:03.480> now<00:03:03.930> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
have went for the super power but now I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
have went for the super power but now I
have<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.319> slip<00:03:04.500> because<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.830> fired<00:03:05.220> plants

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
have to slip because I fired plants

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.979 
have to slip because I fired plants
won't<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.760> doing<00:03:05.850> anything<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.360> his<00:03:06.450> tyranitar

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
won't be doing anything to his tyranitar

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.070 
won't be doing anything to his tyranitar
and<00:03:07.410> he<00:03:08.069> goes<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.610> crunch<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.690> really

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
and he goes for the crunch and I really

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.449 
and he goes for the crunch and I really
predict<00:03:10.350> our<00:03:10.470> predicted<00:03:11.130> him<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> look<00:03:11.430> for

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
predict our predicted him to look for

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.650 
predict our predicted him to look for
the<00:03:11.580> ice<00:03:11.670> beam<00:03:11.880> which<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.120> why<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.300> brought<00:03:12.480> in

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the ice beam which is why I brought in

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.680 
the ice beam which is why I brought in
my<00:03:13.489> terrakion<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.760> first<00:03:14.940> place<00:03:15.090> but

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
my terrakion in the first place but

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
drain like I intended to at first then I

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.150 
drain like I intended to at first then I
would<00:05:41.970> have<00:05:42.000> wasted<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:42.570> move<00:05:42.810> but<00:05:43.680> since<00:05:44.010> I
