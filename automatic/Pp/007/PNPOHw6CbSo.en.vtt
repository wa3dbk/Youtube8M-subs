00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 Oh 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.390
 hello welcome on calzaghe points 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.740
 as we are live from the show's 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.189
 francfort a stone desjardins us 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.869
 are in the booth bmw rather the lobby 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.949
 4 Frankfurt stand obviously for the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.780
 German builders enormously 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.790
 of importance here leaves so are 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.580
 Huge equivalent 2.2 whole hall 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.290
 especially at the Paris Salon then in 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.120
 testifies for example inside this 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.070
 high you have a road that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.510
 snakes inside even on which 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.550
 is actually turning the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.690
 bmw i3 when you are already introduced his 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 case the acts and pierrette will us 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.239
 present this time another one to 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.850
 other models the brand bmw i say 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.690
 it's the second coming is the bmw i8 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.370
 it is the hybrid sports bike of bmw it is 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.930
 just find in ecological cl that goes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.930
 show us of course am I going 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.060
 so here we are stone before this 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.690
 fabulous ecological sportsmanship in some 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.039
 so it's a bmw or it's a bmw here 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.740
 somehow new brand exactly 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.500
 it's a bmw i so here it's a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.599
 new family actually issues bmw the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.270
 May 1st was the i3 we started with 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.590
 a small compact and then the lady wa 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.390
 writes all his know-how to make 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.340
 what she knows to do well is 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.360
 to say a sports car the i8 we 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.250
 discover for the first time 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.800
 aesthetically to it really looks 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.940
 completely shaved at these exams there are 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.890
 aesthetic details 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.950
 it's interesting like those in 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.099
 impression that the cabinet not closed 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.569
 aerodynamics 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.940
 but especially what is very amazing 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.310
 it's mechanics so tell me this case 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.160
 under the hood under the hoods because 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.130
 in the back we find a 3 cylinder 1 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.070
 and 2 5 turbo 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 gasoline 231 horses novelty 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 it's at the front we have an engine 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.680
 electric so it's a hybrid and this 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.829
 electric motor develops 131 horses 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.569
 and comes in reinforcement of this engine 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.860
 thermal tramway this makes renault the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.910
 strategic choices to make so we did not 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.230
 no need to recharge this engine 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.849
 Electric is the abandonment of recharging 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.069
 but we can do it anyway because 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.660
 that we can ride also 35 km in all 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.950
 electric to go to work by 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.610
 example it's very convenient but as 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.810
 ian read 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.910
 there is no risk of breakdown 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.550
 important conspiracy not actually there it's 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.569
 really the engine the ethics that serves the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.090
 thermal engine and thermal engine 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.470
 this is the first motorization the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.970
 car we talked about engines it's a 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.530
 hybrid is with logic it consumes little 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.810
 certainly but is it a real 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.769
 sporty is that so if we do not have 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.209
 tried again by learning that 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.459
 thankfully hands but the numbers 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.040
 math performance is one one has a 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.500
 0 to 100 in 4 seconds 4 doubt limited to 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.900
 250 kilometers an hour is the numbers 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.480
 of a real sports car and then there's 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.849
 not that bikers technique there is 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.680
 also the use of materials 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.170
 as in the i3 it's a cell in 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 carbon and so that cells in 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.470
 carbon says a very contained weight 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.710
 we are under 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.660
 the 800 kg which is excellent on 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.180
 it's not a recipe 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.620
 no no no non natural cars 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.690
 to be marketed from the year 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.060
 next and we even have a price she will 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.240
 sold from 126 thousand euros thank you 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.240
