00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
lassitude we're going to try to get is

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
lassitude we're going to try to get is
rate<00:02:21.549> killer<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.090> that's<00:02:22.989> where<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.670> kill

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
rate killer and that's where you kill

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.600 
rate killer and that's where you kill
all<00:02:24.970> sixth<00:02:25.599> race<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.069> level<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.519> you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
all sixth race on this level so you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.750 
all sixth race on this level so you
don't<00:02:27.760> pass<00:02:27.940> any<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.299> them<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.160> make

waiting here for the second rate to come

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.890 
waiting here for the second rate to come
out<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:39.000> found<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.120> up<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.329> little<00:02:40.450> later<00:02:40.750> as

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
tripit to come out you have to drive

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.550 
tripit to come out you have to drive
through<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.940> guess<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.569> camping<00:02:47.019> area<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
destroyed the driver in the gunner but

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.790 
destroyed the driver in the gunner but
actually<00:04:06.160> destroy<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.240> brain<00:04:07.450> itself<00:04:08.200> then

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
actually destroy the brain itself then

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.240 
actually destroy the brain itself then
you'll<00:04:09.010> get<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.310> achievement<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:12.190> you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
you'll get the achievement so you

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.590 
you'll get the achievement so you
probably<00:04:12.459> saw<00:04:12.640> before<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:13.120> second<00:04:13.480> Wraith<00:04:13.570> is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
probably saw before the second Wraith is

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.349 
probably saw before the second Wraith is
out<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.320> come<00:04:14.620> over<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.190> right<00:04:15.359> get

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
out so come over here to the right get

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.820 
out so come over here to the right get
behind<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.660> leaves<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.200> shoot<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.650> right

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
behind the leaves and shoot the right

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.420 
behind the leaves and shoot the right
and<00:04:18.100> that's<00:04:18.700> four<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.299> six<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.919> there's<00:04:21.250> two

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
and that's four of six so there's two

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.030 
and that's four of six so there's two
race<00:04:21.669> in<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.940> first<00:04:22.150> area<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.990> raise<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.530> this

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
race in the first area to raise in this

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.469 
race in the first area to raise in this
area<00:04:24.400> which<00:04:24.930> probably<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.169> fourth<00:04:27.060> main<00:04:28.060> area

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
area which probably the fourth main area

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.980 
area which probably the fourth main area
that<00:04:28.510> you'll<00:04:28.780> come<00:04:28.930> across<00:04:30.630> next<00:04:31.630> area<00:04:31.840> we

easy to get pretty quickly especially on
Normal<00:05:39.860> difficulty<00:05:40.309> and<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.729> recommend

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:41.119 
Normal difficulty and I recommend

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:44.009 
Normal difficulty and I recommend
