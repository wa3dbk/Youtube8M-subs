you want to make sure the arms are
tucked<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.080> underneath<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:59.070> vehicle<00:03:59.250> just

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
tucked in underneath the vehicle just

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.660 
tucked in underneath the vehicle just
just<00:04:00.840> like<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:01.170> do<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.770> same<00:04:01.980> thing<00:04:02.220> on<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
just like that do the same thing on the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.650 
just like that do the same thing on the
other<00:04:02.730> side<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.150> one's<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.390> little<00:04:03.450> bit

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
other side this one's a little bit

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.480 
other side this one's a little bit
tricky<00:04:03.960> but<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.740> just<00:04:04.860> kind<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> work

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
tricky but you just kind of have to work

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.970 
tricky but you just kind of have to work
with<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> little<00:04:06.390> bit<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.260> then<00:04:07.380> just<00:04:07.620> cut

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
with a little bit and then just cut

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.400 
with a little bit and then just cut
tucks<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.430> underneath<00:04:11.570> just<00:04:12.570> like<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.930> and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
tucks in underneath just like that and

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.870 
tucks in underneath just like that and
then<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.770> can<00:04:13.920> kind<00:04:14.550> of<00:04:14.580> tie<00:04:14.730> everything

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
then you can kind of tie everything

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.530 
then you can kind of tie everything
together

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
together

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.880 
together
and<00:04:15.720> then<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.109> can<00:04:16.260> close<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> side

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
and then you can close in the side

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.910 
and then you can close in the side
windows<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.640> here<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.840> legends<00:04:19.260> strong

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920
