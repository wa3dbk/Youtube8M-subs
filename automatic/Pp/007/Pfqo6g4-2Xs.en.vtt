00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hello my name is Chauncey Smith and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.249 
hello my name is Chauncey Smith and
today<00:00:02.730> I'm<00:00:03.149> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.449> be<00:00:03.600> reviewing<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
today I'm going to be reviewing the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:20.270 
today I'm going to be reviewing the
flash<00:00:04.560> guy<00:00:04.890> FSG<00:00:05.870> t3c

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.050 

so<00:00:21.280> here<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.580> is

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
so here it is

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.220 
so here it is
the<00:00:22.240> floss<00:00:22.510> guy<00:00:22.840> FSG<00:00:23.520> t3c<00:00:24.550> I<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.900> turn<00:00:26.050> it<00:00:26.140> on

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
the floss guy FSG t3c I can turn it on

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.620 
the floss guy FSG t3c I can turn it on
here<00:00:26.560> you<00:00:26.860> have<00:00:27.070> this<00:00:27.220> really<00:00:27.490> nice<00:00:27.730> 4<00:00:28.420> inch

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
here you have this really nice 4 inch

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.610 
here you have this really nice 4 inch
LCD<00:00:29.279> backlit<00:00:30.279> screen<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:32.050> have<00:00:32.169> a<00:00:32.230> model

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 
LCD backlit screen you have a model

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.979 
LCD backlit screen you have a model
memory<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.309> you<00:00:33.700> also<00:00:33.879> have<00:00:34.270> a<00:00:34.570> voltage<00:00:36.989> now

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
memory and you also have a voltage now

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.420 
memory and you also have a voltage now
the<00:00:38.110> reason<00:00:38.350> why<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.500> have<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.860> voltage<00:00:39.040> is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
the reason why you have the voltage is

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.250 
the reason why you have the voltage is
actually<00:00:39.580> because<00:00:39.970> this<00:00:40.120> controller<00:00:40.900> comes

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
actually because this controller comes

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.280 
actually because this controller comes
with<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.559> lithium<00:00:41.739> ion<00:00:42.100> battery<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:44.020> is<00:00:44.080> just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
with a lithium ion battery this is just

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.550 
with a lithium ion battery this is just
a<00:00:44.350> little<00:00:44.620> 3<00:00:44.920> cell<00:00:45.160> lithium<00:00:45.400> ion<00:00:45.850> battery

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
a little 3 cell lithium ion battery

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.170 
a little 3 cell lithium ion battery
really<00:00:47.560> light<00:00:47.829> definitely<00:00:48.520> keeps<00:00:48.730> down<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
really light definitely keeps down the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.690 
really light definitely keeps down the
weight<00:00:49.360> of<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> controller<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.370> way

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
weight of the controller and it's way

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.260 
weight of the controller and it's way
better<00:00:52.000> than<00:00:52.180> having<00:00:52.450> double<00:00:52.899> e's<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.579> once

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
better than having double e's and once

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.170 
better than having double e's and once
this<00:00:55.390> battery<00:00:55.809> dies<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.520> voltage<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
this battery dies the voltage on the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.479 
this battery dies the voltage on the
screen<00:00:58.510> starts<00:00:58.989> blinking<00:00:59.320> and<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.190> starts

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
screen starts blinking and it starts

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.160 
screen starts blinking and it starts
beeping<00:01:02.520> after<00:01:03.520> that<00:01:03.910> you<00:01:04.540> can<00:01:04.690> charge<00:01:04.899> it

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
beeping after that you can charge it

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.850 
beeping after that you can charge it
with<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:06.070> USB<00:01:06.670> over<00:01:07.240> here<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:08.410> just<00:01:08.500> little

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
with this USB over here it's just little

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.780 
with this USB over here it's just little
micro<00:01:09.220> USB<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.899> does<00:01:11.350> come<00:01:11.710> with<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.310> USB

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
micro USB and it does come with a USB

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.620 
micro USB and it does come with a USB
cord

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630

you<00:01:14.500> don't<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.800> to<00:01:14.890> worry<00:01:15.070> about<00:01:15.160> that<00:01:17.550> so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
you don't have to worry about that so

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.640 
you don't have to worry about that so
let's<00:01:18.759> get<00:01:18.910> into<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.240> options<00:01:19.720> now<00:01:20.500> this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
let's get into the options now this

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.240 
let's get into the options now this
scroll<00:01:21.040> wheel<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.700> also<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.299> button<00:01:23.010> so<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.159> has

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
scroll wheel is also a button so it has

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
scroll wheel is also a button so it has

trims this controller actually has a 10
model<00:01:38.770> memory<00:01:39.119> that's<00:01:40.119> really<00:01:40.600> nice<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:41.049> you

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
model memory that's really nice if you

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.929 
model memory that's really nice if you
have<00:01:41.320> multiple<00:01:41.770> vehicles<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.549> don't<00:01:42.700> have<00:01:42.820> to

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
have multiple vehicles you don't have to

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.300 
have multiple vehicles you don't have to
go<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.299> change<00:01:43.840> all<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.140> your<00:01:44.229> settings<00:01:44.740> you

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
go and change all of your settings you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.910 
go and change all of your settings you
change<00:01:45.610> your<00:01:45.759> vehicle<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.650> can<00:01:47.830> also

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
change your vehicle and you can also

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.050 
change your vehicle and you can also
change<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:49.000> name<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.270> all<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.780> your<00:01:50.049> vehicles

change the name of all of your vehicles

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.660 
change the name of all of your vehicles
so<00:01:52.060> that's<00:01:52.210> really<00:01:52.420> nice<00:01:52.689> you<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.830> 2<00:01:53.890> Z<00:01:54.250> and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
so that's really nice you have a 2 Z and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.630

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
have for all three channels and abs I

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.060 
have for all three channels and abs I
can<00:02:09.880> get<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.179> it

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
can get to it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.210 
can get to it
ABS<00:02:12.070> in<00:02:12.280> my<00:02:12.430> opinion<00:02:12.850> is<00:02:13.030> pretty<00:02:13.450> useless<00:02:14.220> that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
ABS in my opinion is pretty useless that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.160 
ABS in my opinion is pretty useless that
might<00:02:15.459> be<00:02:15.579> more<00:02:15.760> useful<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.810> drifting

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
might be more useful with the drifting

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.350 
might be more useful with the drifting
car<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:17.650> something<00:02:18.070> but<00:02:18.489> all<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:18.970> really<00:02:19.000> does

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
car or something but all it really does

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.760 
car or something but all it really does
is<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:20.190> turns<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.670> reverse<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.329> it<00:02:22.570> all

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
is just turns the reverse on it all

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.370 
is just turns the reverse on it all
so<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.520> can't<00:02:24.850> really<00:02:24.940> use<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.200> guys

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
so I can't really use that but you guys

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.340 
so I can't really use that but you guys
might<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.680> able<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.750> that's<00:02:28.750> definitely<00:02:29.320> a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
might be able to that's definitely a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.190 
might be able to that's definitely a
really<00:02:29.980> nice<00:02:30.160> looking<00:02:30.520> controller<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.390> first

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
really nice looking controller I first

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.500 
really nice looking controller I first
opened<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.120> loved<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.420> look<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.930> so

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
opened it I just loved the look of it so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.360 
opened it I just loved the look of it so
on<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.600> side<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.320> have<00:02:38.500> your<00:02:38.890> channel

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
on the side here you have your channel

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.050 
on the side here you have your channel
three<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.450> easy<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.930> press<00:02:42.060> your

than<00:03:12.610> normal<00:03:12.730> controllers<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:14.350> little

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
than normal controllers just little

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.860 
than normal controllers just little
visual<00:03:15.010> thing<00:03:15.340> these<00:03:15.820> two<00:03:16.090> screws<00:03:16.690> are

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
visual thing these two screws are

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.430 
visual thing these two screws are
actually<00:03:17.230> hexes<00:03:17.710> they<00:03:18.100> are<00:03:18.250> real<00:03:18.550> screws<00:03:19.440> not

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
actually hexes they are real screws not

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.080 
actually hexes they are real screws not
sure<00:03:20.620> if<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.950> replace<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.940> your

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
sure if you can replace that to your

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.930 
sure if you can replace that to your
Neil<00:03:22.270> but<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.830> other<00:03:23.980> screws<00:03:24.370> are<00:03:24.730> just

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
Neil but all the other screws are just

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.020 
Neil but all the other screws are just
normal<00:03:25.330> Phillips<00:03:25.810> screws<00:03:26.550> not<00:03:27.550> sure<00:03:27.820> why<00:03:27.970> you

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
normal Phillips screws not sure why you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.770 
normal Phillips screws not sure why you
take<00:03:28.450> control<00:03:28.810> apart<00:03:29.230> anyways<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:30.780> little

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
take control apart anyways a little

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.660 
take control apart anyways a little
miscellaneous<00:03:32.170> thing<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.070> controller<00:03:33.400> can

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
miscellaneous thing the controller can

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.780 
miscellaneous thing the controller can
be<00:03:33.730> stood<00:03:34.240> upright<00:03:34.830> or<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.040> be<00:03:36.160> laid<00:03:36.430> down

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.130 

it's<00:03:39.790> nice<00:03:40.030> because<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.660> don't<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.990> to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
it's nice because you don't have to

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.720 
it's nice because you don't have to
scratch<00:03:41.710> your<00:03:41.950> controller<00:03:42.310> up<00:03:42.520> either

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
scratch your controller up either

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.780 
scratch your controller up either
because<00:03:43.210> it<00:03:43.300> has<00:03:43.480> all<00:03:44.470> these<00:03:44.860> little<00:03:44.920> tabs<00:03:45.460> on

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
because it has all these little tabs on

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.570 
because it has all these little tabs on
it<00:03:45.820> as<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:47.500> here<00:03:48.330> do<00:03:49.330> down<00:03:49.540> here<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:50.430> four<00:03:51.430> on

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580

the<00:03:51.610> bottom<00:03:53.460> now<00:03:54.460> moving<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.210> grip

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
the bottom now moving on to the grip

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.470 
the bottom now moving on to the grip
your<00:03:56.740> shoulder<00:03:56.980> actually<00:03:57.430> comes<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:57.880> two

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
your shoulder actually comes with two

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.300 
your shoulder actually comes with two
different<00:03:58.510> grip<00:03:59.230> sizes<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:02.140> small<00:04:02.800> one<00:04:03.040> as

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
different grip sizes I have small one as

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.920 
different grip sizes I have small one as
you<00:04:03.490> can<00:04:03.610> see<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.550> a<00:04:06.700> little<00:04:06.930> preference

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
you can see but just a little preference

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.170 
you can see but just a little preference
thing<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.980> have<00:04:09.130> bigger<00:04:09.400> hands<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.060> can

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
thing you have bigger hands you can

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.090 
thing you have bigger hands you can
change<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.600> out

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
change it out

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.430 
change it out
but<00:04:12.760> then<00:04:12.940> putting<00:04:13.300> back<00:04:13.510> on<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.080> just<00:04:14.140> slide

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
but then putting back on you just slide

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.620 
but then putting back on you just slide
it<00:04:14.590> over<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> pop<00:04:16.450> all<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.870> clips<00:04:17.410> on

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
it over and pop all the clips on

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.330 
it over and pop all the clips on
naturally<00:04:19.630> easy<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.959> get<00:04:20.110> on<00:04:20.260> off<00:04:20.590> if<00:04:20.980> you<00:04:21.100> want

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
naturally easy to get on off if you want

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.650 
naturally easy to get on off if you want
to<00:04:21.430> change<00:04:21.670> them<00:04:21.910> out<00:04:23.340> now<00:04:24.340> surprisingly<00:04:24.970> you

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
to change them out now surprisingly you

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.260 
to change them out now surprisingly you
think<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:27.070> scenes<00:04:27.430> would<00:04:27.730> be<00:04:27.880> kind<00:04:28.180> of

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
think that the scenes would be kind of

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.870 
think that the scenes would be kind of
uncomfortable<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:30.310> they're<00:04:30.490> actually<00:04:30.640> not

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
uncomfortable but they're actually not

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.420 
uncomfortable but they're actually not
they're<00:04:31.690> really<00:04:31.990> comfortable<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.710> don't

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
they're really comfortable you don't

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.540 
they're really comfortable you don't
really<00:04:33.670> feel<00:04:33.850> them<00:04:34.090> at<00:04:34.210> all<00:04:34.920> then<00:04:35.920> yeah<00:04:36.370> it's

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
really feel them at all then yeah it's

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.650 
really feel them at all then yeah it's
definitely<00:04:36.670> a<00:04:37.000> really<00:04:37.300> comfortable

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
definitely a really comfortable

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.190 
definitely a really comfortable
controller<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.560> one<00:04:38.800> thing<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:39.490> about<00:04:39.520> it

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
controller is one thing I like about it

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.990 
controller is one thing I like about it
but<00:04:41.200> even<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.620> spring<00:04:41.950> tension<00:04:42.190> on<00:04:42.790> the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
but even the spring tension on the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.190 
but even the spring tension on the
throttle<00:04:43.480> is<00:04:43.690> really<00:04:43.930> nice

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200 

rattling<00:04:47.200> is<00:04:47.650> actually<00:04:48.460> lighter<00:04:48.730> and

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
rattling is actually lighter and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.690 
rattling is actually lighter and
breaking<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.140> really<00:04:51.070> like<00:04:52.860> yeah<00:04:53.860> there<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.310> is

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
breaking I really like yeah there it is

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.990 
breaking I really like yeah there it is
