00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello I 'm simons made in this 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 video is a very interesting question 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.500
 namely, where is the difference if 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.360
 bench press maximum power and the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.699
 Bench press what you do for maximum 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 Achieve income for muscle development 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.369
 that's two of course 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.750
 different approaches two 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.640
 different techniques at 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.380
 Bench press you use because you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 course has different goals 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.429
 if maximalkraft wants to press 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.109
 to repeat a single whole 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.669
 move a lot of weight and of course that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.960
 at bridge competition accordingly 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.910
 win over his personal 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 maybe break or record too 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 Whatever it is about muscle building 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.129
 therefore as many muscle fibers as possible 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.540
 activate and the same 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.340
 corresponding growth to the right 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.170
 that means that you just get one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 the best possible breasts possible 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.030
 build muscular voluminous breast 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.559
 I would like to have two different ones 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.149
 Goals are superior therefore 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.680
 There are also different techniques 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.420
 Anyone who has ever had such a ball grid 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.590
 has seen competition wonders 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 probably like that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 Make bank press as noticeable 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 of course that's in the extreme high 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.339
 so make this extreme cross 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.460
 wonders do not know whether I himself 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.409
 can make really amazing how 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.299
 are flexible rather with their backs 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 how extreme their backs over 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.710
 can stretch what the bridge finds 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.210
 build it is called the whole namely the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.310
 Of course, it often looks unhealthy too 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.799
 but that has different advantages 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 build this extreme bridge where you can 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.340
 actually only with the shoulder blades 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 with the law the bank has touched the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 advantage that of course the angle 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.280
 shortens the way to work 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.930
 Shortened trade of motion 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.000
 of course, the corresponding heavy 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 dumbbell with the star weight less 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.040
 centimeters express one shortens the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.119
 way of work and the whole thing will be natural 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.340
 economical economic because one 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.229
 it has to move heavy weight less 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.899
 that's one advantage of the other 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.210
 advantage is that you go through this amrum 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.520
 angle downsized the arm detours 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 less than 90 degrees then you have 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 anatomically just the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 possibility to develop maximum power 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.450
 or more 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.909
 to unfold as if this very path 90 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.200
 the degree is about the vfl already has 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.970
 times collected that one obliquely 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.520
 bank press negative with negative 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.590
 tilt more weight can move or 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.209
 can also increase faster than 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 at the classical bank therefore press 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.020
 easy with the anatomy of the human being too 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 do that by turning your poor arm around 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.989
 less than 90 degrees better power 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.459
 can unfold 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.739
 Another advantage to this is the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.750
 third advantage of this maximalkraft 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.190
 bankers through this extreme technique 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.860
 it is that he and the back muscles 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.540
 with delta muscles can use the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.709
 can also push in nicely 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.959
 that means you use similar only the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.820
 Musculature of the muscles of the chest 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.800
 shoulder muscles but also too 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.380
 still the back to the extremely high 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.790
 weight to move one single time 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.620
 This technique should be in the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.930
 muscle-building areas little bit of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.819
 but do not look up too much 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.410
 it's not just when this one is extreme 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.790
 to build a bridge because we, for example 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.470
 the way to work here not at all 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.300
 want to shorten the concerns us mr a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.650
 to heat the increase arbeitsweg 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.810
 we do not have to be so economical 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.640
 train so save power train 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.739
 but quite the opposite, the technology 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.540
 can also be designed so that just 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.720
 beautiful stimulation on the muscles there 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.530
 that's because you're more likely to be 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.030
 uneconomically trained and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.250
 deals economically with his forces 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.690
 that too can be trick that's why 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.760
 Hollow Cross should not be so extreme 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.140
 fail as partially 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.820
 this maximalkraft bank reason 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.230
 to see that apart from that it 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.170
 few people can give us one 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.390
 a lot of exercise and also flexibility 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.010
 but that requires of course that otherwise 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.420
 As much as possible out of the chest 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.519
 of course that means pushing 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.980
 even that does not really work 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.359
 should contribute much it should be called 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.370
 should not necessarily try now 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.260
 to move them to necessarily purely 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.000
 to take on fight and forced that one 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.019
 trying out the back muscles with 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.820
 to develop power 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.739
 because of course it's important that you turn on 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.690
 all primarily the target muscle and 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.260
 Of course this is the breast meets and 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.599
 that 's what bank printing is all about 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.459
 if possible this powerful massive 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.140
 breast build and for that is the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.120
 Back muscles in the first place now 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.439
 not important that supports anyway 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.629
 but that does not have to be more 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.209
 That's why you have to be forced 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.590
 bridge not so extreme build yes that 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.970
 others, of course, with this way of working 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.390
 I have now addressed the bridge 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.370
 to build 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.829
 the third advantage is that the upper arm 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
 romswinkel is less than 90 degrees is 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.190
 not founding force for decision 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.120
 important to us but rather around the joints 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.739
 to protect 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.630
 It's very important to blame 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.850
 take back that by doing so of course 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.590
 also ensures that the bone 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.139
 or the head of 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.610
 Humerus not in the joints purely 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.039
 So do not push in the bands and 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.050
 Capsules of the shoulder puts us ruined 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.669
 you look at the shoulder muscles so 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.600
 It is very important that you just the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.010
 shoulders back 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.360
 You can see it here again very well 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.900
 So I see you when you press the bank 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.610
 now here 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.410
 Of course you see a bridge 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.870
 take care of that my 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.270
 Shoulder muscles are relieved 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.160
 also an upper arm hull left smaller 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.410
 than 90 degrees making it natural 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.580
 but it will be reasonably economical 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.830
 for me, of course, is in the foreground 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.720
 When I have my joints there it would be and 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.860
 not that I move maximum weight 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.060
 So you see you need you 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.020
 of course a small bridge though 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.449
 it's a bit hard now 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.820
 do not realize it as extreme as that 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.289
 knows banking oppressors give maximum strength and 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.120
 which is used to the whole 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.770
 looks only relatively humane and also 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.699
 not necessarily so dangerous from all over 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.650
 on the contrary, I already have it 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.300
 My bank is explained by technology 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.430
 just very gentle on the joints as I mean 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.050
 shoulder school and just prevent that 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.000
 The head of the humerus gives it to me 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.979
 to help directly in the capsule and ribbons 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840
 in the long run, blame me completely 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.400
 subscribes to another thing is it wants 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.020
 I'll show you a quick look 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.580
 but just how I press so 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.349
 I directly press a line 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.690
 between point a after point b but 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.190
 a semicircle around it, so to speak 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.650
 should be a bit exaggerated 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.599
 elliptical motion leadership man presses 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.070
 it does not directly crossed 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.050
 line but the dashed 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.420
 here you press the above, so to speak 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.220
 according to the human anatomy 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.480
 If you air that was out of there you have one 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.340
 especially beautiful realms on the 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.870
 complete chest muscles straight 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.430
 by simply giving the anatomy 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.810
 man also noticed and me 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.460
 inevitably try yourself in such a way 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.710
 go inside where you just go 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.850
 only from point a to point b must press 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.830
 that is of course the disadvantage 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.270
 Life happens when you turn on machines 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.040
 trained because these are precisely the 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.540
 direct movement leadership have the yes 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.920
 actually not the people so 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.510
 behind lives the pending for the 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.010
 People did not do that, they did 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.110
 said as I have just seen 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.760
 this slight diffraction easier 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.350
 semicircle around the times now exaggerated 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.300
 express such an elliptical shape 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.280
 maybe it's the closest 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.330
 actually what is best that was 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.770
 nothing a few tricks to 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.150
 I already have you 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.770
 I want to do a lot of videos 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.760
 now do not repeat the whole 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.840
 tricks that I told you ever 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.910
 I have to explain again 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.860
 there you look from myvideo description 1 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.270
 Since they still have a lot of videos on the subject 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.410
 Bench press there you can get that 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.940
 or look at others 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.530
 otherwise , of course, very important 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.000
 that you translate that yourself 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.350
 maybe also from the training partner 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.180
 lets you watch whether you really are 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.560
 doing everything right because you yourself 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.150
 Of course, it usually looks like it 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.770
 not if you're down there on the bench 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.390
 lies and a fault he drives 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.160
 Of course, not because of that 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.780
 see four eyes or two 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.790
 strangers then probably a bit 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.320
 more than your own all so much 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.450
 on the topic of bench press have there a few 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.400
 we can see differences 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.820
 in the next video many greetings yours 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.820
