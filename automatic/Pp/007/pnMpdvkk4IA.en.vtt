00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 that's years old belongs to the bio 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.390
 learn what an enzyme is 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.859
 but what im doing this little protein in 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 everyday life or how they should 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.599
 work of it had absolutely none 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 plan in this video we will him and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.710
 explain how important enzymes are for you 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.990
 our lives are and where we are them 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.990
 To meet daily so stay tuned 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.880
 before we deal with the enzymen in everyday life 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.010
 Let's start with that again 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.080
 why one is too defined at all 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.300
 an enzyme is nothing but an 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.730
 protein's biochemical reactions 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 So catalyze can accelerate the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 do in sum by minimizing the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.970
 activation energy of a reaction 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 so it can be easier 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.949
 not all enzymes are proteins 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 But there are very few exceptions 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.280
 That's why we can almost always of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 go out 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 enzymes are also recognizable because you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 name on haase ends as soon as you know what 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.650
 from lipase hydro la or something like that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 until you know it is now enzyme too 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
 the enzymes in everyday life 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.440
 jan just has to go to school today 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.930
 got up and pulled fresh 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 clothes on recovered clean t shirts 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.010
 stonewashed jeans and mid cap from the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 closet after getting dressed 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.240
 and his daily vitamins 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.060
 he goes under breakfast 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.490
 hmm delicious bread is beer because it is running 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 the water in the mouth together but moment 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 what does that have to do with the enzymes? 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.950
 a whole lot of the enzymes were up 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.970
 mentioned here already six times 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.540
 we'll take a look at it all again 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.460
 at the front 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.010
 already while washing jeans laundry 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.200
 Enzyme was involved in as well as 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.560
 All detergents contain the enzymes 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.780
 lipase denture and amylase help you 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.240
 when removing fat in white 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.620
 or stain marks on clothing and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.300
 that already at very low 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.390
 temperatures so you can tidy 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.970
 energy and also save on costs 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.920
 the jeans were zylberberg the stone 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.380
 washed effect was formerly with the help of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.480
 Pumice reached that was very 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 consuming and expensive it was namely 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.679
 a lot of water energy and machinery 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.370
 needed to get the look you want 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.170
 to reach 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.200
 It's much easier nowadays 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.420
 decomposes with the help of enzymes cellulosic 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.420
 for example, the outer colored layer 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.580
 the cotton fibers and la casa oxidized 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.739
 The typical service dye to and 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 then gently stands the stone 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.420
 washed effect without pollutants and only 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.700
 with half the cost in the area of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.620
 In medicine, enzymes are also used 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.499
 among other things in the production of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.860
 vitamin b2 and coincidentally, yes 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.420
 never 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.130
 take every morning so lu tablets 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.290
 earlier that was six vitamins 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.630
 chemical steps made with 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.490
 Enzymen's help is enough 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.100
 biological process of both 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.440
 ecologically as well as economically the old one 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.850
 procedure by lengths also strikes in 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.220
 In this case, you can with the help of 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.370
 Enzymen significantly cut costs and 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.950
 although by up to 40 percent , we come to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.660
 breakfast bread and beer for the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.790
 production of both foods 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.890
 enzymes are used in the bread 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 including amylase and proteases 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.420
 used so that the dough rises better 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.000
 and thus more elastic and less 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.520
 The beer becomes sticky on the lawn 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.040
 peptides and many other enzymes 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.170
 used with your help gets stronger 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.300
 easier to sugar and the sugar can 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.280
 then just in alcohol and carbonated 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.320
 be converted sugar if you like that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.540
 Water in the mouth is converging again 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.360
 into the team at work in our saliva 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.420
 For example, there are the enzymes amylase per 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.489
 oxidase and moore amylase amylase 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.820
 splits strength to double sugar 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.170
 combat maltose and the other two 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.330
 pathogens and bacteria and 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.320
 thus protect against serious infections 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.600
 and diseases 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.640
 So you see how important enzymen 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.650
 our everyday lives are already in the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.110
 first few minutes of the day we are 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.420
 encountered them too often though 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.440
 A life without them would be unthinkable 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.090
 most do not even like that 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.590
 exist write us in the times 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.209
 comments if we have more about the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.250
 enzymes in everyday life or want to know 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.900
 where they come from then we show you where 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.400
 Otherwise we'll be in seven rounds 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.350
 need without knowing that at all 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.060
 there are and before that ever ago 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.470
 if you are not for the rotz 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.430
 more interested then click on it 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.930
 this video here 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.729
 There we show you like a virus 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.500
 So it's essential to watch 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.010
 otherwise three people are doing well 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.010
 and ciao
