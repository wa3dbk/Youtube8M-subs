00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
terrible especially since they end up

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.700 
terrible especially since they end up
together<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:23.570> marabouts<00:05:24.080> almost<00:05:24.320> they<00:05:24.440> always

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
together in marabouts almost they always

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.600 
together in marabouts almost they always
end<00:05:24.890> up<00:05:24.950> together<00:05:25.130> so<00:05:25.960> that's<00:05:27.280> awful<00:05:28.280> that's

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
end up together so that's awful that's

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.360 
end up together so that's awful that's
so<00:05:29.030> awful<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.500> don't<00:05:30.770> know<00:05:30.890> why<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.100> ever

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
so awful and I don't know why I ever

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.310 
so awful and I don't know why I ever
thought<00:05:31.670> that<00:05:31.730> was<00:05:31.940> acceptable<00:05:32.180> but<00:05:32.900> that<00:05:33.200> is

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
thought that was acceptable but that is

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.410 
thought that was acceptable but that is
a<00:05:33.350> theme<00:05:33.590> that<00:05:33.620> came<00:05:33.890> up<00:05:33.950> a<00:05:34.190> few<00:05:34.220> times<00:05:34.520> not

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
a theme that came up a few times not

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.080 
a theme that came up a few times not
great<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.380> did<00:05:36.740> enjoy<00:05:36.920> quite<00:05:37.700> a<00:05:37.730> lot<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:37.970> her

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
great but I did enjoy quite a lot of her

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.130 
great but I did enjoy quite a lot of her

books for example perfect terrible title
just<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:42.950> really<00:05:43.190> enjoyed<00:05:43.430> this<00:05:43.580> book<00:05:43.640> in

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
just I really enjoyed this book in

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.430 
just I really enjoyed this book in
particular<00:05:43.940> because<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:45.110> female

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
particular because the female

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.800 
particular because the female
protagonist<00:05:45.590> was<00:05:46.130> very<00:05:46.550> very<00:05:46.790> strong<00:05:47.240> she

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
protagonist was very very strong she

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.870 
protagonist was very very strong she
wasn't<00:05:48.140> at<00:05:48.200> all<00:05:48.290> naive<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:48.770> week<00:05:49.100> she<00:05:49.490> was<00:05:49.610> just

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
wasn't at all naive a week she was just

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.490 
wasn't at all naive a week she was just
like<00:05:50.060> not<00:05:50.690> going<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:50.900> take<00:05:51.050> shit<00:05:51.260> from<00:05:51.290> anyone

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
like not going to take shit from anyone

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.070 
like not going to take shit from anyone
which<00:05:52.280> is<00:05:52.400> really<00:05:52.520> great<00:05:52.700> to<00:05:52.880> see<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:53.600> just

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
which is really great to see so just

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.140 
which is really great to see so just
from<00:05:54.140> the<00:05:54.290> point<00:05:54.470> of<00:05:54.650> sex<00:05:55.400> scenes<00:05:55.610> obviously

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
from the point of sex scenes obviously

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.220 
from the point of sex scenes obviously
there<00:05:56.330> are<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.420> lot<00:05:56.540> of<00:05:56.570> sex<00:05:56.810> scenes<00:05:56.990> in<00:05:57.140> these

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
there are a lot of sex scenes in these

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.440 
there are a lot of sex scenes in these
books<00:05:57.440> they're<00:05:58.040> not<00:05:58.160> very<00:05:58.340> realistic<00:05:58.730> if<00:05:59.240> you

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
books they're not very realistic if you

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.310 
books they're not very realistic if you
were<00:05:59.570> looking<00:05:59.840> for<00:05:59.990> something<00:06:00.200> in<00:06:00.260> the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
were looking for something in the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.050 
were looking for something in the
romance<00:06:00.680> genre<00:06:00.770> I'm<00:06:01.250> not<00:06:01.400> sure<00:06:01.670> if<00:06:01.880> I<00:06:02.000> would

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
romance genre I'm not sure if I would

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.950 
romance genre I'm not sure if I would
recommend<00:06:02.660> anything<00:06:04.060> just<00:06:05.060> because<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.600> don't

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
recommend anything just because I don't

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.840 
recommend anything just because I don't
think<00:06:06.050> obviously<00:06:06.440> they<00:06:07.400> don't<00:06:07.520> have<00:06:07.730> the

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
think obviously they don't have the

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.640 
think obviously they don't have the
greatest<00:06:08.150> literary<00:06:08.600> merit<00:06:09.140> I<00:06:09.320> don't<00:06:09.530> think

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
greatest literary merit I don't think

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.840 
greatest literary merit I don't think
there's<00:06:09.770> anything<00:06:09.950> wrong<00:06:10.130> with<00:06:10.310> reading<00:06:10.700> them

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
there's anything wrong with reading them

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.280 
there's anything wrong with reading them
I<00:06:11.030> think<00:06:11.240> there<00:06:11.360> are<00:06:11.390> a<00:06:11.450> guilty<00:06:11.750> pleasure<00:06:11.870> and

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
I think there are a guilty pleasure and

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.720 
I think there are a guilty pleasure and
if<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.710> enjoyed<00:06:12.950> them<00:06:13.130> then<00:06:13.430> there<00:06:13.610> is

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
if you enjoyed them then there is

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.220 
if you enjoyed them then there is
nothing<00:06:13.940> wrong<00:06:14.210> with<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.510> so<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.080> last

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
nothing wrong with that so the last

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.440 
nothing wrong with that so the last
question<00:06:15.350> is<00:06:15.860> you<00:06:16.160> stumble<00:06:16.610> across<00:06:16.640> a<00:06:16.940> portkey

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
question is you stumble across a portkey

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.240 
question is you stumble across a portkey
what<00:06:17.840> fictional<00:06:18.110> world<00:06:18.470> would<00:06:18.650> you<00:06:18.680> not<00:06:18.980> want

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
what fictional world would you not want

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.310 
what fictional world would you not want
to<00:06:19.310> be<00:06:19.430> transported<00:06:19.640> into<00:06:20.150> server<00:06:21.020> this<00:06:21.140> i'm

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
claustrophobic but also of course they

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.130 
claustrophobic but also of course they
are<00:06:34.370> mainly<00:06:34.760> boys<00:06:35.030> in<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.420> glade<00:06:35.600> and<00:06:35.900> what<00:06:36.110> a

are mainly boys in the glade and what a

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.360 
are mainly boys in the glade and what a
girl<00:06:36.410> has<00:06:36.560> put<00:06:36.710> in<00:06:36.800> there<00:06:36.980> they<00:06:37.100> don't<00:06:37.190> really

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
girl has put in there they don't really

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.470 
girl has put in there they don't really
treat<00:06:37.670> her<00:06:37.820> very<00:06:37.850> well

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
treat her very well

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.540 
treat her very well
we<00:06:38.630> wouldn't<00:06:38.900> really<00:06:39.200> want<00:06:39.530> to<00:06:39.680> be<00:06:39.770> a<00:06:39.800> girl<00:06:40.190> in

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.190 
we wouldn't really want to be a girl in
the<00:06:40.640> situation<00:06:40.850> I<00:06:41.510> don't<00:06:41.840> think<00:06:41.870> it<00:06:42.050> would<00:06:42.140> be

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
the situation I don't think it would be

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.170 
the situation I don't think it would be
very<00:06:42.230> fun<00:06:42.710> so<00:06:43.130> that<00:06:43.280> was<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:43.730> not<00:06:43.880> safe<00:06:44.030> for

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
very fun so that was the not safe for

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.480 
very fun so that was the not safe for
work<00:06:44.210> tag<00:06:44.570> I<00:06:44.840> really<00:06:45.800> enjoyed<00:06:46.040> filming<00:06:46.250> this
