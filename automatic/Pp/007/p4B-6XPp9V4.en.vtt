00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.230
 in this test, butter was offered, although the favorite treat was wild 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.230
 of those that you have inserted between two plastic cylinders 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.809
 You can only get the candy by disassembling the material exactly in 

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.419
 the reverse order to which it has been mounted 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.889
 thanks this would test the ingenuity of a bonus is even that of a child's 

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.889
 short age 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.090
 after that the trial and error system 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 has solved the puzzle 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.650
 while another to observe and learn from the movements and gear 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.730
 ap 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.440
 when it was the turn of the observer to copy the movements of the first 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 solving the problem to get your reward 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.480
 below a reduction test 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.500
 It is unlikely that a wild kia has seen a puzzle before 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 it still takes a few minutes to claim the prize 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 one step further 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.540
 this device invites the bird to create a simple mental map to discover from 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 what accounts should you throw 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.110
 most animals would use the trial and error system but 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 smart that still goes straight to the solution 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.570
 impressed the scientists would go an even more complex problem 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.779
 cold 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.619
 the book was about all the types and research centers have to 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.659
 ascend utility 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.290
 but it is difficult to prevent such sharp-minded creatures from ending up 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.290
 bored and frustrated in their cages 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.030
 if a puzzle is offered those in captivity confront him with 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.029
 enthusiasm 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.609
 efecom 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.129
 until he escaped 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.559
 in all the elements that we have seen so far the birds in solving the 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.559
 problem to get a reward 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.739
 but what happens if a test was designed that the bird can not solve alone 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.959
 the result now depends on teamwork 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:32.389
 tunnel and you need another strip of rope to be able to get the food 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 again and again those that you have shown that they can cooperate 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.129
 who are not impressed by our standards if there is a way to 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.129
 cheating is according to the press 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.189
 do not kiss it is not clear who tests the link here and 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.319
 Finally the device is proof of euros 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.520
 those who stop us from playing the fool and go to work to get the 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 peanuts 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:03.209
 those who were also smart are creatures with a social structure 

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:07.689
 complex always willing to use their mental capacity and help each other 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.689
 others 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.810
 cannon
