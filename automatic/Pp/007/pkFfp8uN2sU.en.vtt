00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
constrictors are carnivorous so because

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.200 
constrictors are carnivorous so because
these<00:00:19.320> guys<00:00:19.560> are<00:00:19.800> carnivorous<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.609> because

is fully nutritional for these guys and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
is fully nutritional for these guys and
they<00:00:32.130> eat<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> whole<00:00:32.669> Mouse<00:00:33.770> when<00:00:34.770> they're

they eat the whole Mouse when they're

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.560 
they eat the whole Mouse when they're
smaller<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.820> feed<00:00:36.090> what's<00:00:36.329> called

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
smaller you can feed what's called

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.280 
smaller you can feed what's called
pinkies<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:38.120> newborn<00:00:39.120> Mouse<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.020> the

pinkies which is a newborn Mouse and the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
pinkies which is a newborn Mouse and the
way<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> figure<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:40.920> how<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> feed

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
way you figure out how much is you feed

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
way you figure out how much is you feed
or<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.719> should<00:00:42.750> feed<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.340> depending<00:00:44.340> on

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
or what you should feed is depending on

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
or what you should feed is depending on
the<00:00:44.550> size<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> snake<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.989> should<00:00:46.020> never

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the size of the snake you should never

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
the size of the snake you should never
feed<00:00:46.710> anything<00:00:47.039> larger<00:00:47.610> than<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> largest

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
feed anything larger than the largest

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
feed anything larger than the largest
diameter<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> snake<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.739> rule

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
diameter of the snake that's a good rule

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970 
diameter of the snake that's a good rule
now<00:00:51.059> how<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.390> feed<00:00:51.719> them<00:00:51.930> most<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> time

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
now how do we feed them most of the time

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
now how do we feed them most of the time
these<00:00:53.489> guys<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.329> take<00:00:54.510> care<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.170> their

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
these guys will take care of it on their

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680 
these guys will take care of it on their
own<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.090> new<00:00:57.239> snake<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
own but when you get your new snake you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
own but when you get your new snake you
have<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.989> remember<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.500> he's<00:00:58.680> nervous<00:00:59.090> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
have to remember that he's nervous so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
have to remember that he's nervous so
let<00:01:00.989> him<00:01:01.140> enjoy<00:01:02.100> his<00:01:02.309> terrarium<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.030> get

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
let him enjoy his terrarium and get

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
let him enjoy his terrarium and get
comfortable<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:04.049> environment<00:01:04.260> for

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
comfortable in an environment for

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.789 
comfortable in an environment for
several<00:01:05.309> days<00:01:05.460> before<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> feed<00:01:06.630> him

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
several days before you try to feed him

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
several days before you try to feed him
be<00:01:07.799> very<00:01:08.070> conscious<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> where<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> feed<00:01:09.510> him

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
be very conscious of where you feed him

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.250 
be very conscious of where you feed him
because<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.189> sand<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> substrate

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
because if you have sand or a substrate

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.109 
because if you have sand or a substrate
woodchips<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.670> should<00:01:14.790> never

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
woodchips which you really should never

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539 
woodchips which you really should never
use<00:01:15.450> anything<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.530> stick<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> bait

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
use anything that can stick to the bait

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.800 
use anything that can stick to the bait
when<00:01:18.299> he<00:01:18.479> eats<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.110> he'll<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:20.009> eat<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
when he eats it he'll also eat that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.330 
when he eats it he'll also eat that
substrate<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.409> cause<00:01:22.590> obstructions

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
substrate and it can cause obstructions

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.820 
substrate and it can cause obstructions
and<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.659> serious<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and that is very very serious so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
and that is very very serious so
sometimes<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> substrate<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.750> your

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
sometimes if the substrate in your

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020 
sometimes if the substrate in your
terrarium<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.619> such<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> sticks<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.000> can

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
terrarium is such that it sticks you can

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
terrarium is such that it sticks you can
do<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> several<00:01:30.960> things<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:32.159> either

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
do one of several things you can either

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.410 
do one of several things you can either
put<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> bait<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.439> small<00:01:34.890> cup<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> bury<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
put the bait in a small cup and bury it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
put the bait in a small cup and bury it
down<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> level<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.100> terrarium<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
down to the level of the terrarium and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
down to the level of the terrarium and
the<00:01:39.000> snake<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.420> come<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.229> move

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the snake will come and get it or move

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
the snake will come and get it or move
the<00:01:41.130> snake<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.390> terrarium<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.079> feed

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the snake out of the terrarium and feed

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.010 
the snake out of the terrarium and feed
it<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.560> another<00:01:43.829> spot<00:01:44.240> sometimes<00:01:45.240> especially

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it in another spot sometimes especially

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719 
it in another spot sometimes especially
as<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.470> larger<00:01:46.920> that's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.280> good<00:01:47.460> thing

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
as they get larger that's a good thing

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.639 
as they get larger that's a good thing
because<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.509> snake<00:01:48.780> learns<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.500> going

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
because the snake learns when it's going

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.289 
because the snake learns when it's going
to<00:01:49.860> eat<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> sometimes<00:01:50.520> its<00:01:50.880> energy<00:01:51.270> level

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to eat and sometimes its energy level

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.480 
to eat and sometimes its energy level
can<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.200> when<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.829> reaching<00:01:53.040> into

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
can get up and when you're reaching into

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you may get nipped now how do we feed

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
you may get nipped now how do we feed

me my friend when it comes back into the
mouth<00:02:21.800> will<00:02:22.550> contact<00:02:23.150> what's<00:02:23.510> called<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
mouth will contact what's called the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.350 
mouth will contact what's called the
vomeronasal<00:02:24.550> apparatus<00:02:25.550> or<00:02:25.700> Jacobson's

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
vomeronasal apparatus or Jacobson's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.800 
vomeronasal apparatus or Jacobson's
organ<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:27.440> helps<00:02:27.950> them<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.880> sensation<00:02:29.660> of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
organ that helps them get a sensation of

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.290 
organ that helps them get a sensation of
or<00:02:30.260> olfaction<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.220> what's<00:02:31.670> out<00:02:31.850> there<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
or olfaction of what's out there and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.430 
or olfaction of what's out there and
then<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.830> these<00:02:34.069> small<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:34.850> pores

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
then they have these small little pores

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.520 
then they have these small little pores
called<00:02:36.440> pic<00:02:36.680> glands<00:02:37.160> around<00:02:37.459> their<00:02:37.819> lips<00:02:38.030> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
called pic glands around their lips and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.030 
called pic glands around their lips and
what<00:02:39.530> they<00:02:39.709> do<00:02:39.769> is<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.700> they<00:02:40.910> actually<00:02:41.180> sense

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
what they do is is they actually sense

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.030 
what they do is is they actually sense
infrared<00:02:43.040> heat<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.590> thermal

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
infrared heat so it's a thermal

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.190 
infrared heat so it's a thermal
regulatory<00:02:46.910> thing<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.360> where<00:02:47.540> they<00:02:47.959> actually

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
regulatory thing to where they actually

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.110 
regulatory thing to where they actually
can<00:02:48.470> see<00:02:48.890> heat<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.519> almost<00:02:49.760> like<00:02:49.970> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
can see heat it's almost like the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.640 
can see heat it's almost like the
predator<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.780> movies<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.350> know<00:02:51.440> where

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
predator in the movies you know where

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.320 
predator in the movies you know where
you<00:02:51.739> saw<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> little<00:02:52.340> red<00:02:52.519> thing<00:02:52.730> well<00:02:53.120> that's

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
you saw the little red thing well that's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.729 
you saw the little red thing well that's
exactly<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.959> they're<00:02:54.140> doing<00:02:54.530> they're

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
exactly what they're doing they're

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.699 
exactly what they're doing they're
picking<00:02:55.069> up<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.340> heat<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:56.170> they'll<00:02:57.170> strike

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
picking up the heat and they'll strike

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.550 
picking up the heat and they'll strike
at<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.130> now<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.030> never<00:02:59.630> want<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.019> hold<00:03:00.290> your

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
at it now you never want to hold your

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
at it now you never want to hold your
mouse

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
mouse

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.250 
mouse
sometimes<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.420> needs<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.780> move<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.110> little

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
sometimes that needs to move a little

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.350 
sometimes that needs to move a little
bit<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.830> what<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.130> do<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.459> get<00:03:04.610> longer<00:03:04.940> tongs

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
about 16 inches and you'll put the mouse

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.590
