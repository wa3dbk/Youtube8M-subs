bottom and when I started to do that I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
bottom and when I started to do that I
did<00:01:49.229> notice<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.790> cradle

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

started<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> lift<00:01:52.110> off<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> case<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.369> glued

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
started to lift off the case it is glued

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.240 
started to lift off the case it is glued
on<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.930> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.290> noticed<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> peeling

apart when I put a lot of pressure down

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.240 
apart when I put a lot of pressure down
there<00:01:57.960> because<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> little<00:01:59.100> bit

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
probably - at least in each one and then

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.670 
probably - at least in each one and then
room<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.210> even<00:02:27.450> more<00:02:27.570> stuff<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.200> pocket

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
with this which is a little bit

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.860 
with this which is a little bit
unfortunate<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.180> me<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.300> would<00:02:33.510> think<00:02:33.690> with

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
unfortunate to me I would think with

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840 
unfortunate to me I would think with
such<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> big<00:02:34.860> case<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.160> maybe<00:02:35.520> could<00:02:35.790> have

such a big case that maybe could have

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.370 
such a big case that maybe could have
incorporated<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.750> guess<00:02:36.930> because<00:02:37.110> of

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
incorporated that but I guess because of

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.230 
incorporated that but I guess because of
the<00:02:37.470> wood<00:02:37.650> cradle<00:02:38.220> there's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.850> no<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.210> to
