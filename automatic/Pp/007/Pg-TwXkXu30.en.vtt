00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.820 

hi<00:00:05.130> thanks<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:05.640> tuning<00:00:06.089> in

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
hi thanks for tuning in

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.169 
hi thanks for tuning in
so<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.370> one's<00:00:09.290> acting<00:00:10.290> very<00:00:10.559> strange<00:00:11.179> very

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
so this one's acting very strange very

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
so this one's acting very strange very
strange<00:00:12.300> indeed<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.960> motor<00:00:16.260> does<00:00:16.949> not

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
strange indeed so the motor does not

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.279 
strange indeed so the motor does not
want<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> come<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.000> it'll<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.570> palm<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
want to come on it'll just palm this

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.060 
want to come on it'll just palm this
with<00:00:19.500> twelve<00:00:19.859> me<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:21.420> I've<00:00:22.380> tried<00:00:22.410> several

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
with twelve me and I've tried several

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.140 
with twelve me and I've tried several
capacitors<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:28.250> does<00:00:29.250> make<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.910> bit<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
capacitors and does make a little bit of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.359 
capacitors and does make a little bit of
difference<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.840> put<00:00:31.050> another<00:00:31.380> capacitor<00:00:32.160> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
difference but put another capacitor in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.420 
difference but put another capacitor in
it<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.469> there's<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.860> mop

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it and so there's your mop

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.709 
it and so there's your mop
now<00:00:36.180> that's<00:00:36.510> harder<00:00:37.140> than<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> could<00:00:37.620> read

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
now that's harder than that could read

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.000 
now that's harder than that could read
are<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> supposed<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> read<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.710> can't

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
are you supposed to read that I can't

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.410 
are you supposed to read that I can't
Mar<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> anyway<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.910> Scott

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
Mar so anyway it's just one here Scott

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.470 
Mar so anyway it's just one here Scott
which<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:52.160> looks<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:55.469> she<00:00:55.739> got

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
which there looks like this and she got

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.830 
which there looks like this and she got
that<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> timer<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:59.719> doesn't<00:01:00.719> really

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that kind of timer on it doesn't really

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
that kind of timer on it doesn't really
look<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.800> else<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.640> wrong<00:01:02.670> with

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
look like much else can go wrong with

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.899 
look like much else can go wrong with
this<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:09.930> I've<00:01:10.049> done<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> I've

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
this here and so what I've done is I've

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.800 
this here and so what I've done is I've
swapped<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> motors<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.479> they<00:01:15.479> will<00:01:15.630> not

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
swapped the motors and they will not

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.859 
swapped the motors and they will not
start<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.920> hum<00:01:17.330> but<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> couldn't

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
start they just hum but what I couldn't

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
start they just hum but what I couldn't
understand<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.119> when<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.180> turn<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
understand it is that when I turn it on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.109 
understand it is that when I turn it on
I<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.439> spin<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.130> spin<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> was

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I can spin it I can spin it and it was

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.300 
I can spin it I can spin it and it was
start<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.990> spin<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> either<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
start and I can spin it either way and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.690 
start and I can spin it either way and
it'll<00:01:26.729> still<00:01:27.000> start<00:01:27.890> but<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.310> spin<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it'll still start but I have to spin it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.020 
it'll still start but I have to spin it
otherwise<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.570> sit<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.200> hum

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
otherwise it will just sit there and hum

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.460 
otherwise it will just sit there and hum
and<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.479> I've<00:01:33.630> tried<00:01:33.900> several<00:01:34.320> different

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and so I've tried several different

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.399 
and so I've tried several different
other<00:01:34.920> motors<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.689> I<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.049> other<00:01:37.290> one

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
other motors and I have this other one

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.410 
other motors and I have this other one
over<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.460> good

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.840 

I<00:01:43.540> pull<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.110> motor<00:01:44.439> from<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.979> one<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.580> put

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
I pull the motor from that one and put

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.080 
I pull the motor from that one and put
it<00:01:45.880> over<00:01:46.030> here<00:01:46.830> try<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:51.549> comes<00:01:51.820> right

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
it over here try it and it comes right

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.420 
it over here try it and it comes right
on<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:57.070> basically<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:59.259> original

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
on so that that's basically the original

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.230 
on so that that's basically the original
capacitor<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> original<00:02:03.490> motor<00:02:03.759> that

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
capacitor in the original motor that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.259 
capacitor in the original motor that
went<00:02:04.450> over<00:02:04.690> there<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.330> would<00:02:08.289> guess<00:02:08.679> that

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.610 

there<00:02:13.269> is<00:02:13.660> some<00:02:14.080> problem<00:02:14.349> with<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.769> timer<00:02:16.620> I'm

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
there is some problem with the timer I'm

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.820 
there is some problem with the timer I'm
not<00:02:17.860> sure<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.720> then<00:02:19.930> anyone<00:02:20.350> has<00:02:20.500> ever<00:02:20.620> had

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
not sure but then anyone has ever had

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.259 
not sure but then anyone has ever had
this<00:02:20.980> problem<00:02:21.280> I'd<00:02:21.549> sure<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.910> know<00:02:22.120> about

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
this problem I'd sure like to know about

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.100 
this problem I'd sure like to know about
it<00:02:22.620> thanks<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.650> watching
