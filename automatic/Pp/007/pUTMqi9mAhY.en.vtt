00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.490
 There is urgency and how 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.750
 are you going for me it's going great we get 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.719
 found on a brand new video 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 frankly how from the cartridge to 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.870
 I liked this time 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.089
 no damage so frankly are 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.940
 rather complicated as shepard would say 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.830
 like boss because already doing an ad 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 with guys so lightened it's not 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.949
 easy with markers then without them 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.029
 ice creams and it's really complicated so 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.890
 that's why I'll ask for a little 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.240
 like frankly it's after super 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 pleasure because I have a lot of fun 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.260
 I still have the case people hitting 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 I chatted about how to be early 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 I had but that the request and so I 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.610
 finally go messi here so I was in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.750
 pauline company or blue leader of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.910
 Maxim and udc 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.090
 so here's a big thank you to them 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.840
 frankly they helped me enormously to 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.010
 always the same technique 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.079
 it's a bit the same technique that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 mathieu lives 12 modules and that is to say 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.910
 that he took care of the center and I 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.370
 bypasses and I take from behind in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.449
 just here I am frankly that's it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 make thunder try it frankly 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 you will adopt 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.030
 here is finally brief quick class 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.990
 double to talk about it I'll tell you so 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 I have everything flat and so I carried 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.560
 charles lwanga sleight of hand 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 assassin is trader we advise 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.409
 really crack on a con it's 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.320
 much more effective than plovers alone 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.759
 I find in hand -to-hand acceleration 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.670
 the displacements do not side 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.290
 honestly put rather tracker 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 then amato trigger specialist 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.909
 g10 is solid and determination i 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.409
 even when they try to travel or 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.790
 specialists because good on a bridge 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 it still remains very useful 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.290
 finally here that's why I would just like to talk 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.299
 a bit of my last big lab video 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.770
 beautiful she shocked a lot and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.619
 a lot of green thumb bousfer 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 while today almost 100 people 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.659
 and only 2 inches will be so 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.340
 really happy 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.470
 this tale not seen the video show blending 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.259
 notation immediately clicked france 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 because she video to these people have 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.270
 appreciated me it really touches me it's 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 so I have the picture is planned in fact of 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 actually reiterate this video with the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.500
 same stadium concept with more movies 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.230
 so it was mob rambo so this 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.970
 Once I go by the terminator mob 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.900
 I finish then I tell you not by 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.239
 against which weapons it is 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.830
 surprise I have not done so yet 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.500
 it's still a pretty complicated ad 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
 it's not easy to manage 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.319
 so those who really know the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.540
 movies here pastis all that with what 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:36.360
 weapons it will be counted I 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.720
 invite you to go 4 year old voices knowing 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.400
 that the last draw you go you 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.569
 Anyway, that's where I actually 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.239
 would like to talk about something actually it's 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.470
 soon back to school and so frankly 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.930
 it hurts the ass I have the balls 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.170
 I think a lot of subscribers 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.239
 many of you whose balls 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.349
 tell me in the comments if I have 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.810
 had small anecdotes 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.069
 precisely on that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.780
 it was actually last week and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.540
 jallet I was going shopping with 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.819
 my mother checked and frankly 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.680
 it was enough you know to success there 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.739
 it's back to school said back 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.880
 school says purchase and frankly 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.590
 crossroads they are malignant m 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.060
 you know military in front 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.030
 the entrance as his road to force us 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.220
 to leave his base tomorrow and therefore the most 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.049
 funny is that I'm going 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.760
 in front and there I pass in front of 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.980
 satchels but what do I see I 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.000
 see a little girl with her mom 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.680
 of a little girl trying days of 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.900
 time it's mostly at this stage 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.950
 frankly it's time shopping 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.849
 to see more so to go 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.260
 further and pens 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.260
 so I go ahead and the girl actually 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.880
 she is the pink little bag barbie the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.650
 little schoolbag not but frankly 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.510
 it was starboard the little girl harper 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.750
 tasks go there because that you want 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.180
 not buy the name no to buy a bag 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.220
 them to buy a bag last year on 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.069
 will buy you that every year you will do 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.239
 the year with this one little by little this 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.569
 article is mom please the 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.340
 qualifies however limited brothel in 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.269
 all the shop 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.209
 well enough, I think it's a 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.329
 first time I laughed as much as 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.979
 buying choice is actually a little bit more 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.269
 far I continue and there what I 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.500
 see another kid so the same slice 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.560
 age 7 8 years is the him 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.000
 it was the panoply of weapons the guy he 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.620
 wanted to call them a bell manga 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.330
 think they speak they even 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.950
 the shoes superspeedway my form 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.840
 frankly it's because he had 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.380
 released in my city finally lampard was born 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.300
 he had his plot it's hard I had 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.830
 want to eat playful genres and to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.020
 liliane 12 permanent who are at the cinema 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.060
 go see him the little one there I hear 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.370
 well he'll see if it's not but 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.190
 frankly it's really 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.740
 finally here is the jeanne see throwing 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.730
 unless finally it was Belgian people whose 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:03.250
 robbie from belgium robidas la 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.150
 belgium the caribbean is so here i 'm going 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.070
 more very far from fashion 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.350
 I remember just hurried a lot 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.090
 because I told my friends and 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.060
 boots actually two weeks in support 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.169
 to those crazy to stop by the low docks 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.450
 because at first I did not expect the 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.770
 all at this time so here I use my 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.070
 bag and go nobs who was still 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.810
 enough 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.190
 it's the only one of the part of what 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:29.860
 forgive me too soon I have my 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.900
 last clip for the top 5 I also 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.570
 took a top 10 where I started the 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.850
 editing but it misses two three clips 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.410
 so that's not to be defined rap 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:44.320
 as quickly as possible and that's 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:46.840
 again have you seen there so you have 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.479
 but there frankly 4800 it was 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:56.919
 really raymond jean shorts field 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:59.290
 had the balls if he had missed pretty much 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.280
 no risk and here I come in touch 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.630
 foremost with my helmet 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.430
 so that's the importance of play with a 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.810
 helmet and here I develop it frankly 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.090
 he really was really really 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.360
 doing you have there I really do the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.360
 crowd 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.900
 so here I had planted myself like a 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.270
 shit 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:21.190
 short word to qualify without 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.840
 damage so even more so I'll you 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.220
 make a kiss on the left nipple and the 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.180
 tea forehand and I tell you to the 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.180
 next wall they play
