00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.690
 hello friends welcome to this kitchen 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.210
 Look, let's prepare a footstep 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.250
 terrifying for the mass of the base of 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.990
 this pizza we have put strong flour 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.560
 Now we add a little water with 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.570
 sugar and salt and a pinch we give you three 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.119
 turns chairs and now we put the rest 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.890
 of water with baker's yeast the 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.950
 press work achieves fresh 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.740
 I added olive oil 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.210
 and give him more laps, well, in fact 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.400
 many turn around because that is what 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.710
 we have to do is mix everything 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.840
 very well that it is integrated and when we see 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.270
 that the mass separates from the walls of the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.600
 so we take it out and we'll work 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.160
 on the table you see here we have it and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.160
 on the table we work with our hands 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.960
 very clean hands and come around 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.550
 also to knead if we need a 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.950
 little more flour you can toss it 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.750
 that does not stick to us we passed 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.489
 10-15 minutitos 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.510
 if we have who is much better and the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.510
 we let him give 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.530
 good good good how good this has 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.210
 triplicate and more here we have already the mass 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.790
 let's take out the air that has 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.680
 introduced helped for that what 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.780
 we do is knead a little bit we give 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.970
 four strokes that does not become the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.790
 issue in violence and we continue with the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 roll we have to stretch the dough 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.570
 stretch it and give it the shape we want 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.400
 in this case I had thought how this is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.950
 terrifying in shaping it as a coffin 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.750
 agree to what I'm going to do 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.310
 is to make a kind of rectangle and 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.840
 then he cut the edges a bit 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.840
 giving him the macabre form 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.230
 good for the filling you see a little 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.750
 ham cooked mushroom 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.810
 and since we're not going to give you a base of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.160
 Tomato puree tomato first thing and 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.120
 on it generous mozzarella cheese and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.980
 generous in the kitchen is always 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.880
 generous with mozzarella that is not going to 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.700
 come very well the mushroom laminitas and 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.620
 the cooked ham a little oil of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.620
 olive and oregano also and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.840
 I'm getting to know a new burrito dÃ³niz 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.330
 that in 4 minutes we will have them and the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.220
 we look green olive 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.379
 look here they are already on the verge of quail 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.209
 see what difference between one and the other 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.129
 you know why because some are more 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.530
 fresh this one that is whole is the most 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.940
 cool the next one has already lost water 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.640
 it has become air and the last one the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.230
 poor already has a significant gap is 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.780
 a curiosity that I wanted to tell you 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.700
 well we take the egg and what 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.519
 we divide in two this is going to be two 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.340
 extraordinary popular balloons look 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.840
 there will go the pupil of the iris and other 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 that I prepare it with the green olive and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 a little bit of black olive so that 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.660
 between well I put a little bit of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.609
 ketchup and there's the eyeball 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.890
 terrifying here you have it is not bad 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.299
 and I believe that this eye until time and if 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.129
 you want then you put a little bit of 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.209
 blood and I'm here is that they had 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.209
 blood and I'm putting ketchup 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.790
 well follow in his footsteps but we have now 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.350
 the fingers very well let's do the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.170
 part as well as the nail in small 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.890
 you lower the sausages you see and here we go 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.660
 to put the part of the nail very well 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.430
 wrinkles of the phalanx you know the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.459
 wrinkles come out of double sign pains 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.320
 the fingers will not have knees 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.570
 here we take them away a little bit and now 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.660
 we have the finger now the onion the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.060
 we split the ends as you see is a 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.160
 Pickled chive with pickled vinegar 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.800
 we start with two ideas that come out 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.560
 detached nails look how good 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.000
 good good a little ketchup more 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.520
 want we give a little bit of color too 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.990
 to the wrinkles of the fingers and place 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.720
 the nail in its place 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.790
 notice that the most macabre that the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.580
 idea is to with the twisted nail is thing 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.580
 but but the subject seems natural 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.750
 come let's finish the pizza we're going to 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.390
 decorate this I'm going to do with a 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.110
 normal pizza 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.220
 because it is what you are doing 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.230
 dress her with these special effects or 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.240
 be that even simpler good 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.130
 friends that you see that this is a very 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.530
 cool person, so I encourage you that the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.820
 do you have a little bit with the summary and the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.820
 tricks a greeting
