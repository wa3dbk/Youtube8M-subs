00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 and I won I'm g20 and today we are 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.380
 here to make a video in which talking about 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.480
 the code-share chip 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.490
 for those who do not know do not know what happens 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.760
 among the chip is the largest golf tournament 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 from you of the year and dude 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.560
 the tournament is worth a million dollars 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.310
 the first person out of there with a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.439
 hefty $ 400,000 good and year 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.360
 past has had several problems in you 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.579
 I have had several problems and not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.610
 get because of passport and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.250
 I just wanna take my ass and roll too. 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.079
 This year I did not go back it was late 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 Too much so I ended up leaving here too. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.660
 I played and how I had several problems in the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.399
 last year this year 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 the guys were not believing too much 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.899
 I wanted to have that vacancy for Brazil 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.180
 It was two o'clock the Brazilian team. 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.670
 then there will be two teams representing the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.100
 people out there and this is very good people 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 this is very good because LG is coming 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.510
 Brazil is starting to give value 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.960
 for our community that will start 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.320
 to grow very good and I think most 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 of the rest of the world had classificatory 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 in wool and Brazil did not have this was a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 Big problem because it happens. 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 who rolls a little gallery and stays 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 making a team made to play I do not 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.979
 I know if it's just to have fun or strain 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.170
 really mess up and it harms 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.650
 too many people wanting to be there 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 fighting for it as the case of taking 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.090
 a team that is all cute with everything 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.610
 world over eighteen to go there and play 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.579
 out there and ends up eliminating this team only 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.470
 that's why it's a bitch 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.990
 too expensive I do not know if it's a bit of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.630
 surely it is none other than it is for sure 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.479
 the immaturity of the people who do not see it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.909
 that is taking the place of the crowd that has 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 chance they have the opportunity to leave 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.180
 I had to go there for those who do not know 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 very much like what happened 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.060
 classified was between the months of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.740
 January and February is Brazil, I think 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.959
 had two qualifiers 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 one was on day one was now in the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.940
 penultimate weekend and February 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.820
 last 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.350
 on the 23rd, and the other was on the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.350
 February 16 or these two 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.140
 classificatory was by the site of LG 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.390
 it was all out there the crew 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.280
 organized everything by the dgb site itself 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.600
 who does not know the site very well and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.970
 maybe I do not understand but I'm not talking 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.090
 but do not know is very simple you go there 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.470
 wrote your team will leave the table you 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.260
 see who will play we think it was 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.880
 pass though play is quite simple this 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.990
 There is not much secret, so it happened. 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.850
 on these two days the two 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.870
 Brazilian qualifiers may be 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.660
 now with the arrival of lg Brazil is in the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.550
 Brazil and do not have any more 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.170
 online or perhaps even 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 have why out there in the united states 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.880
 had a qualifying two singers 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.890
 online that would qualify for a 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.320
 wool classificatory 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.300
 for him the chip title maybe year that 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.100
 Come on, Brazil, this is going to be a lot. 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.830
 Good, because it will solve the problem. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.600
 of those people who are under 18 who 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.760
 Are you trying to play to get in the way? 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.740
 It will solve a lot will punish you is 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.380
 much better to play obviously does not have 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.780
 leg does not have those bickering for rouch 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.360
 etc by then I'll take that next year 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.489
 this changes a lot with the arrival 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.800
 of the energy that Brazil really is 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.650
 fix these problems that this is a 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.880
 very boring thing but kate bush is going 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.890
 happen in Los Angeles on the 28th to 30th 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.890
 March 2014 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.020
 obviously 1132 out of 32 teams in the world 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.080
 all 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.150
 so if you want to see the cottbus chip from 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.709
 Join the tv point that will be 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.510
 passing there surely in the whole galley 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.150
 The world is tweeting that day. 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.160
 Epic to people twisting a lot in Brazil 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.920
 It's okay this time we're going out with 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.860
 a very strong team type is the most 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.660
 strong we have already had outside is a 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.260
 galley playing a lot 10 allows more 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.170
 strong that will read it oh 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.780
 and I do not remember if the baby is 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.230
 Brazil got the visa it seems that the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.989
 problem of his addiction does not 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.959
 addiction and as 4th player a great 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.900
 possibility of being the action if that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.729
 for those who do not know the hex the ori it 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.250
 it's a europe product wall 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.290
 Brazilian kinship 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.560
 So he talks to him, send some 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.540
 Portuguese and the guy is a monster that's a year 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.480
 passed in the code share between the chip he 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.390
 edson came in sixth place 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.290
 the guy is very monster is I think 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:46.050
 to end swc he they were in second 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.820
 placed and play the counted with a flea 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.130
 match against the complex 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.600
 they will each game he plays too much 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.670
 does not have much to talk about 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.220
 the only one is a monster and this great 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.320
 possibility of playing for Brazil and 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.340
 It will be awesome if this really 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.650
 to happen 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.350

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.440
 we were there with claw to grow and 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.780
 competitive and civilized society expects
