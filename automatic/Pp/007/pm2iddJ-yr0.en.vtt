00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everybody, we 're going to make a 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.660
 on a special bolognese sauce with a 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.309
 different tip 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.309
 I hope you like it, come on. 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.180
 First the low fire we go 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.670
 If putting a pot will put more 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.220
 or two tablespoons full of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.560
 sugar certainly early in the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.039
 video you should already be aware that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.960
 Weird to put sugar in the beginning of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.030
 eye that they usually put there only 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 to add a sauce even more 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 People are going to do it differently. 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.570
 sure you will like 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 with these two spoons of sugar goes 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.239
 add half chopped onion 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 Now we'll have a shake when they 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 evolution is virtually transparent to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.760
 people already add three teeth daily 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 well minced now this one stirs a lot 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 and lets it be good to more or less last 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.079
 because it will not reach a point of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 pain to put because of the sugar but 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.920
 when she has more or less like this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.979
 well that I have well melted and our 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.350
 fuck here can not is get hurt 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.710
 we will put more or less one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.979
 bath spoon or you can use is the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.040
 I agreed that I would prefer an olive oil 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.159
 to help and in the new too 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.909
 We're going to put half a pound of meat 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.560
 ground 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.710
 you can use it and the cargo you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 preference of yours is the brand of the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.329
 meat the kind of meat too but have to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 being a good year is that I am 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.290
 good 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.329
 not good there a good face that moves 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.390
 quite mix everything in the pan 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.000
 with the spoon does not leave 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.310
 her mother was all in full 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.960
 together that separates her enough to stay 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 very loose 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.820
 I'm going to face you in the pot. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.250
 She's always stirring, she's not leaving much. 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.190
 stop just to stay at the right spot 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.740
 now add a little salt and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.180
 she is almost at the point already in this 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.000
 month on our part 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.910
 few people add two tomatoes without 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 skin well cut up we will grow 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.830
 It's not expensive and it mixes a lot here. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.770
 I'm also using a cup of 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.480
 sauce ready you can use the extract of 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.720
 tomato but I like to use the sauce 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.750
 ready then if you guys use there 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.930
 present a preference of yours there 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.880
 plus a cup of water too if you are 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.910
 I do I get the type one sachet eye 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.700
 no one stays, and then it is complete with 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.800
 inhabited water to take the excess beyond 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.530
 sauce over the river is full and 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.180
 in the pan with a little salt and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.400
 also some oregano 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.320
 now you cover the pan and let it 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.200
 low fire 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.620
 there about 30 minutes only 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.450
 pro the tomato to disappear practically 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.620
 for it to become a sauce and also in the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.620
 morumbi released 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.900

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.230
 flow wins so you can use it 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.280

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.260
