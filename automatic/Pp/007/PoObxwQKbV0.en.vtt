00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
usually scout after I make my for you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
usually scout after I make my for you
know<00:02:04.469> warping<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.159> warp<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.850> make

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
know warping not warp in but like make

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
know warping not warp in but like make
my<00:02:06.540> gateway<00:02:06.979> but<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.129> time<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.369> chose<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
my gateway but this time I chose to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.160 
my gateway but this time I chose to
scout<00:02:09.060> early<00:02:09.330> i<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.690> wanted<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> know

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
scout early i really wanted to know

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.800 
scout early i really wanted to know
where<00:02:10.770> he<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.190> especially<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.270> map

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
where he was especially on this map

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.550 
where he was especially on this map
because<00:02:13.810> there<00:02:13.930> are<00:02:13.989> four<00:02:14.170> different<00:02:14.290> play

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
because there are four different play

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.259 
because there are four different play
three<00:02:15.099> different<00:02:15.370> places<00:02:15.459> he<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.939> be<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:17.140> yes

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
three different places he can be so yes

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.339 
three different places he can be so yes
really<00:02:19.269> doing<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.659> same<00:02:19.780> kind<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.049> built<00:02:20.230> here

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
really doing the same kind of built here

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.690 
really doing the same kind of built here
but<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.709> kind<00:02:20.829> of<00:02:20.950> scared<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.340> chrono

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
but I get kind of scared and chrono

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.280 
but I get kind of scared and chrono
boosted<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.299> sell<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.659> out<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.959> kill<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
boosted this sell it out to kill the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.559 
boosted this sell it out to kill the
probe<00:02:23.650> which<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> stupid<00:02:24.909> idea<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.299> think<00:02:25.420> I

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
probe which is a stupid idea I think I

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.929 
probe which is a stupid idea I think I
shouldn't<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.560> chrono<00:02:26.859> boost<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.370> save

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
shouldn't have chrono boost and save

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.580 
shouldn't have chrono boost and save
that<00:02:28.120> up<00:02:28.299> this<00:02:28.810> probe<00:02:29.019> was<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.319> attacking

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
that up this probe was just attacking

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.319 
that up this probe was just attacking
pile<00:02:29.859> and<00:02:29.980> there's<00:02:30.129> no<00:02:30.280> point<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:30.609> it<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> my

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
pile and there's no point of it and my

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.630 
pile and there's no point of it and my
probe<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.750> sitting<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.230> his<00:02:32.319> base<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
probe just sitting in his base and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.410 
probe just sitting in his base and
waiting<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.920> scout<00:02:35.920> him<00:02:36.040> out<00:02:36.189> so<00:02:37.060> we're<00:02:37.209> doing

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
waiting to scout him out so we're doing

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.699 
waiting to scout him out so we're doing
the<00:02:37.510> exact<00:02:37.810> same<00:02:37.840> kind<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.230> builds<00:02:38.560> and

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
the exact same kind of builds and

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.009 
the exact same kind of builds and
getting<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.129> cyber<00:02:39.400> right<00:02:39.909> one<00:02:40.090> he<00:02:40.299> he<00:02:40.750> gets

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
getting my cyber right one he he gets

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.640 
getting my cyber right one he he gets
his<00:02:41.409> cyber<00:02:41.680> relatively<00:02:42.639> same<00:02:42.849> time<00:02:43.019> but<00:02:44.019> he

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
his cyber relatively same time but he

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.610 
his cyber relatively same time but he
put<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.370> think<00:02:45.760> three<00:02:46.599> probes<00:02:46.900> on<00:02:47.139> gas

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
put I think three probes on gas

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.250 
put I think three probes on gas
instantly<00:02:48.579> whereas<00:02:48.879> I<00:02:49.060> kind<00:02:49.599> of<00:02:49.689> waited<00:02:49.959> a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
instantly whereas I kind of waited a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.720 
instantly whereas I kind of waited a
moment<00:02:50.439> and<00:02:50.829> put<00:02:51.040> one<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:51.489> put<00:02:51.639> his

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
moment and put one and then put his

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.429 
moment and put one and then put his
second<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.629> he's<00:02:52.780> gonna<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:53.049> way<00:02:53.409> more

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
second one so he's gonna have way more

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.229 
second one so he's gonna have way more
gas<00:02:53.769> than<00:02:54.129> me<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.609> he's<00:02:54.730> probably<00:02:54.819> gonna<00:02:55.030> go<00:02:55.209> a

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
gas than me so he's probably gonna go a

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.720 
gas than me so he's probably gonna go a
gas<00:02:55.659> heavy<00:02:55.900> kind<00:02:56.169> of<00:02:56.260> built<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.489> don't

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
gas heavy kind of built here I don't

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.339 
gas heavy kind of built here I don't
know<00:02:57.790> what<00:02:58.209> he's<00:02:58.329> gonna<00:02:58.419> try<00:02:58.689> and<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.900> he<00:02:59.169> might

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
know what he's gonna try and do he might

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.890 
know what he's gonna try and do he might
be<00:02:59.500> going<00:02:59.620> stock<00:03:00.340> or<00:03:00.609> heavy<00:03:00.730> or<00:03:01.120> building<00:03:01.750> some

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
be going stock or heavy or building some

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.869 
be going stock or heavy or building some
kind<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.139> fast<00:03:02.379> tech<00:03:02.620> but<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.639> go<00:03:03.669> he

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
kind of fast tech but there you go he

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.250 
kind of fast tech but there you go he
kills<00:03:04.120> my<00:03:04.239> pro<00:03:04.450> because<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.870> wasn't<00:03:05.019> paying

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
kills my pro because I wasn't paying

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.440 
kills my pro because I wasn't paying
attention<00:03:05.379> at<00:03:05.829> all<00:03:05.889> and<00:03:06.370> he<00:03:06.400> started<00:03:07.299> to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
attention at all and he started to

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.569 
attention at all and he started to
research<00:03:07.780> warp<00:03:08.260> gate<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.769> making<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.340> stalker

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
research warp gate and making a stalker

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.729 
research warp gate and making a stalker
while<00:03:09.849> my<00:03:10.120> gate<00:03:10.389> or<00:03:10.629> cybernetics<00:03:11.319> core<00:03:11.470> just

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
while my gate or cybernetics core just

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.710 
while my gate or cybernetics core just
comes<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.280> chrono<00:03:12.549> boost<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:12.970> stalker

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
comes in and I chrono boost a stalker

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.629 
comes in and I chrono boost a stalker
but<00:03:14.139> I<00:03:14.379> don't<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.739> supply<00:03:15.189> because<00:03:15.370> I

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
but I don't have the supply because I

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.369 
but I don't have the supply because I
was<00:03:15.730> not<00:03:16.329> paying<00:03:16.540> attention<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.959> got<00:03:17.079> supply

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
was not paying attention to got supply

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.009 
was not paying attention to got supply
block<00:03:17.620> but<00:03:17.859> I<00:03:17.889> killed<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.340> own<00:03:18.370> probe<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.840> so

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
block but I killed my own probe just so

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.020 
block but I killed my own probe just so
this<00:03:20.169> stalker<00:03:20.500> can<00:03:20.829> come<00:03:21.040> out<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:21.489> does<00:03:21.790> some

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030

it's<00:03:24.280> not<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:24.579> horrible<00:03:24.940> don't<00:03:25.180> do<00:03:25.299> that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
it's not it's horrible don't do that

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.899 
it's not it's horrible don't do that
don't<00:03:26.169> get<00:03:26.290> supply<00:03:26.650> blocked<00:03:26.919> so<00:03:27.699> that<00:03:27.819> was

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
don't get supply blocked so that was

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.849 
don't get supply blocked so that was
pretty<00:03:28.030> horrible<00:03:28.269> play<00:03:28.690> by<00:03:28.870> me<00:03:29.049> but<00:03:29.229> I<00:03:29.530> think<00:03:29.769> I

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
pretty horrible play by me but I think I

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.379 
pretty horrible play by me but I think I
just<00:03:30.069> had<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.250> do<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:30.729> to<00:03:30.849> get<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.120> stock

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
just had to do it just to get that stock

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.909 
just had to do it just to get that stock

it<00:03:36.099> as<00:03:36.310> many<00:03:36.579> times<00:03:36.639> as<00:03:36.879> possible<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.419> get<00:03:37.540> that

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
it as many times as possible to get that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.759 
it as many times as possible to get that
really<00:03:38.079> really<00:03:38.379> fast<00:03:40.109> warp<00:03:41.109> gate<00:03:41.319> sec<00:03:41.560> and

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
really really fast warp gate sec and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.069 
really really fast warp gate sec and
he's<00:03:41.799> getting<00:03:42.579> his<00:03:42.819> second<00:03:43.269> guest<00:03:43.449> now<00:03:43.659> mmm

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
he's getting his second guest now mmm

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.569 
he's getting his second guest now mmm
that's<00:03:44.379> going<00:03:44.650> he's<00:03:44.979> gone<00:03:45.099> really<00:03:45.430> gasps

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
that's going he's gone really gasps

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.360 
that's going he's gone really gasps
heavy<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.030> he's<00:03:46.150> going<00:03:46.329> this<00:03:46.750> 111<00:03:47.500> zealots

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
heavy so he's going this 111 zealots

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.949 
heavy so he's going this 111 zealots
entry<00:03:48.849> or<00:03:49.859> zealots<00:03:50.859> stalkers<00:03:51.609> entry<00:03:51.970> from<00:03:52.690> his

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
entry or zealots stalkers entry from his

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.619 
entry or zealots stalkers entry from his
gateway<00:03:53.500> which<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.879> think<00:03:55.090> that's<00:03:55.479> actually

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
gateway which is I think that's actually

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.420 
gateway which is I think that's actually
pretty<00:03:55.930> good<00:03:56.139> because<00:03:56.439> then<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.709> can<00:03:56.889> have

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
pretty good because then you can have

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.369 
pretty good because then you can have
one<00:03:57.760> zealot<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.239> fight<00:03:58.569> whatever<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:59.049> at<00:03:59.199> your

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
one zealot to fight whatever is at your

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.050 
one zealot to fight whatever is at your
door<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.949> stalker<00:04:00.189> to<00:04:00.430> shoot<00:04:00.699> and<00:04:00.879> then<00:04:01.030> a

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
door is stalker to shoot and then a

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.479 
door is stalker to shoot and then a
century<00:04:01.419> to<00:04:01.449> force<00:04:01.780> field<00:04:02.019> which<00:04:02.199> is<00:04:02.319> a<00:04:02.590> really

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
century to force field which is a really

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.869 
century to force field which is a really
nice<00:04:04.030> kind<00:04:04.359> of<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:05.409> know<00:04:05.439> mix<00:04:05.949> whereas<00:04:06.729> I'm

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
nice kind of you know mix whereas I'm

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.530 
nice kind of you know mix whereas I'm
just<00:04:07.150> two<00:04:07.510> zealots<00:04:07.840> stalker<00:04:08.519> which<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:09.729> okay

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
just two zealots stalker which is okay

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.330 
just two zealots stalker which is okay
you<00:04:10.989> know<00:04:11.109> and<00:04:11.319> by<00:04:11.409> making<00:04:11.620> my<00:04:11.799> second<00:04:12.159> stalker

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
you know and by making my second stalker

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.520 
you know and by making my second stalker
and<00:04:12.489> making<00:04:12.759> another<00:04:12.939> gateway<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.599> seems

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
and making another gateway and seems

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.439 
and making another gateway and seems
like<00:04:14.680> Huck<00:04:14.889> is<00:04:15.040> making<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.459> gateway<00:04:15.939> and<00:04:16.180> a

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
like Huck is making a gateway and a

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.830 
like Huck is making a gateway and a
robotics<00:04:17.109> facility<00:04:17.289> mmmm<00:04:18.720> robotics<00:04:19.720> facility

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
robotics facility mmmm robotics facility

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.959 
robotics facility mmmm robotics facility
I<00:04:20.109> guess<00:04:20.320> that's<00:04:20.500> why<00:04:20.620> he<00:04:20.650> got<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.130> second<00:04:21.729> gas

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
I guess that's why he got the second gas

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.200 
I guess that's why he got the second gas
there<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:23.680> should<00:04:24.279> be<00:04:24.460> making<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.849> robotics

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
there and I should be making a robotics

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.430 
there and I should be making a robotics
facility<00:04:25.330> actually<00:04:25.870> no<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.020> need

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
facility actually no I need

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.980 
facility actually no I need
more<00:04:26.710> gas<00:04:26.950> but<00:04:27.220> my<00:04:27.520> second<00:04:27.970> assimilator<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:28.720> up

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
more gas but my second assimilator is up

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.620 
more gas but my second assimilator is up
so<00:04:29.920> i<00:04:29.950> will<00:04:30.400> be<00:04:30.550> getting<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.880> really<00:04:31.420> really

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
so i will be getting that really really

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.920 
so i will be getting that really really
soon<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.230> now<00:04:32.770> Huck<00:04:33.310> has<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> reasonable<00:04:34.360> army

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
soon so now Huck has a reasonable army

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.190 
soon so now Huck has a reasonable army
but<00:04:35.140> he<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.440> getting<00:04:35.620> his<00:04:35.890> warp<00:04:36.220> gates<00:04:36.490> right

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
but he is getting his warp gates right

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.690 
but he is getting his warp gates right
before<00:04:38.200> i<00:04:38.230> do<00:04:38.380> but<00:04:38.680> i<00:04:38.740> think<00:04:39.040> this<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.460> pretty

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
before i do but i think this is a pretty

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.510 
before i do but i think this is a pretty
cool<00:04:39.880> timing<00:04:40.300> right<00:04:40.990> when<00:04:41.230> this<00:04:41.590> finishes<00:04:41.890> and

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
cool timing right when this finishes and

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.760 
cool timing right when this finishes and
the<00:04:42.730> Sentry<00:04:43.150> finishes<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.470> Gateway

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
the Sentry finishes and the Gateway

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.350 
the Sentry finishes and the Gateway
finishes<00:04:45.190> then<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.700> make<00:04:45.910> them<00:04:46.060> into

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
finishes then I just make them into

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.860 
finishes then I just make them into
gateways<00:04:46.780> or<00:04:47.020> warp<00:04:47.920> gates<00:04:48.130> sorry<00:04:48.400> and

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
gateways or warp gates sorry and

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.840 
gateways or warp gates sorry and
constantly<00:04:49.870> making<00:04:50.050> purposes<00:04:50.530> good<00:04:51.190> idea<00:04:51.520> to

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
constantly making purposes good idea to

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.730 
constantly making purposes good idea to
do<00:04:51.970> but<00:04:52.390> he's<00:04:52.720> got<00:04:52.960> about<00:04:53.110> three<00:04:53.350> stalkers<00:04:53.590> a

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
do but he's got about three stalkers a

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.200 
do but he's got about three stalkers a
century<00:04:54.100> in<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.250> couple<00:04:54.520> zealots<00:04:54.820> whereas<00:04:55.060> I

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
century in a couple zealots whereas I

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.520 
century in a couple zealots whereas I
have<00:04:55.450> two<00:04:56.200> plus<00:04:57.720> i'm<00:04:58.720> going<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.020> work<00:04:59.170> in<00:04:59.320> two

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
have two plus i'm going to work in two

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.920 
have two plus i'm going to work in two
stalkers<00:04:59.830> here<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.340> two<00:05:01.120> zealots<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.690> i<00:05:01.810> have

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
stalkers here and two zealots and i have

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.510 
stalkers here and two zealots and i have
a<00:05:02.020> century<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.740> probe<00:05:02.980> coming<00:05:03.250> here<00:05:03.430> oh

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
a century and a probe coming here oh

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.390 
a century and a probe coming here oh
yeah<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.820> probe<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.300> build<00:05:04.710> not<00:05:05.710> so<00:05:06.160> much

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
yeah the probe to build not so much

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.420 
yeah the probe to build not so much
proxy<00:05:06.850> prop<00:05:07.030> I'll<00:05:07.840> on<00:05:08.020> it's<00:05:08.230> just<00:05:08.530> this<00:05:09.370> is

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
proxy prop I'll on it's just this is

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.950 
proxy prop I'll on it's just this is
where<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:09.730> want<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.090> be<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.450> little<00:05:10.570> choke

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
where I want to be this little choke

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.170 
where I want to be this little choke
here<00:05:11.290> or<00:05:11.500> it's<00:05:11.950> not<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:12.340> much<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.670> choke<00:05:12.910> but

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
here or it's not so much of a choke but

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.510 
here or it's not so much of a choke but
I<00:05:13.450> want<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.050> control<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.620> area<00:05:15.010> up<00:05:15.190> here<00:05:15.220> in

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
I want to control this area up here in

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.130 
I want to control this area up here in
the<00:05:15.580> middle<00:05:15.760> so<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:15.970> can<00:05:16.180> kind<00:05:16.420> of<00:05:16.540> secure<00:05:16.960> my

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
the middle so I can kind of secure my

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.930 
the middle so I can kind of secure my
expansion<00:05:17.800> which<00:05:17.950> is<00:05:18.100> going<00:05:18.340> down<00:05:18.490> right<00:05:18.880> now

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
expansion which is going down right now

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.880 
expansion which is going down right now
but<00:05:19.600> seems<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:19.900> Huck<00:05:20.140> key<00:05:20.320> was<00:05:20.440> about<00:05:20.710> to

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
but seems like Huck key was about to

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.200 
but seems like Huck key was about to
move<00:05:21.040> everybody<00:05:21.340> does<00:05:21.610> somebody<00:05:21.760> gets<00:05:22.090> this

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
move everybody does somebody gets this

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.750 
move everybody does somebody gets this
really<00:05:22.540> quick<00:05:22.750> observer<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.470> is<00:05:24.160> making<00:05:24.400> a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
really quick observer and is making a

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.200 
really quick observer and is making a
warp<00:05:25.240> prism<00:05:25.780> which<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.110> um<00:05:26.890> I<00:05:27.760> don't<00:05:27.910> see<00:05:28.180> that

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
warp prism which is um I don't see that

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.970 
warp prism which is um I don't see that
too<00:05:28.480> much<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:29.530> think<00:05:29.800> that's<00:05:29.920> really

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
too much and I think that's really

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.770 
too much and I think that's really
unique<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.490> i<00:05:30.610> really<00:05:30.940> like<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:31.300> i'm<00:05:31.419> actually

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
unique and i really like it i'm actually

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.390 
unique and i really like it i'm actually
going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.080> try<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.290> doing<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.010> kind<00:05:33.160> of<00:05:33.250> play

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400

that<00:05:33.430> he<00:05:33.610> does<00:05:33.760> later<00:05:34.210> on<00:05:34.360> this<00:05:34.510> video<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.960> he

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
that he does later on this video and he

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.860 
that he does later on this video and he
makes<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.470> secret<00:05:35.919> robotics<00:05:36.460> pay<00:05:36.640> here<00:05:36.910> hmm

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
makes a secret robotics pay here hmm

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.500 
makes a secret robotics pay here hmm

trying to go for those or early colossi
probably<00:05:40.930> he's<00:05:41.590> obviously<00:05:41.800> not<00:05:42.010> going<00:05:42.190> for

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
probably he's obviously not going for

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.920 
probably he's obviously not going for
the<00:05:42.430> upgrades<00:05:42.700> he's<00:05:42.820> going<00:05:43.000> colossi<00:05:43.419> that's

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
the upgrades he's going colossi that's

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.290 
the upgrades he's going colossi that's
definite<00:05:44.410> but<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.100> doesn't<00:05:45.790> seem<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:46.030> be<00:05:46.120> taking

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.330 
definite but I doesn't seem to be taking
the<00:05:46.510> expansion<00:05:46.960> but<00:05:47.080> making<00:05:47.410> just<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.710> one<00:05:48.160> base

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
the expansion but making just a one base

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.310 
the expansion but making just a one base
kind<00:05:48.640> of<00:05:48.730> all<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:49.030> wouldn't<00:05:49.540> say<00:05:49.690> all<00:05:49.720> anybody's

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
just making a one base play here but

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.400 
just making a one base play here but
here<00:05:52.120> we<00:05:52.210> go<00:05:52.300> i<00:05:52.360> get<00:05:52.540> cocky<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.020> trying<00:05:53.320> to

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
here we go i get cocky and trying to

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.530 
here we go i get cocky and trying to
attack<00:05:53.620> your<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:54.220> beautiful<00:05:54.820> split<00:05:55.300> of<00:05:55.419> my

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
attack your the beautiful split of my

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.480 
attack your the beautiful split of my
units<00:05:55.870> with<00:05:55.990> that<00:05:56.080> force<00:05:56.410> field<00:05:56.500> Huck<00:05:56.890> but

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
units with that force field Huck but

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.760 
units with that force field Huck but
then<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.640> mess<00:05:58.419> up<00:05:58.450> and<00:05:58.870> start<00:05:59.080> moving<00:05:59.230> my<00:05:59.410> units

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
then I mess up and start moving my units

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.960 
then I mess up and start moving my units
to<00:05:59.830> get<00:05:59.950> away<00:06:00.250> once<00:06:00.490> they're<00:06:00.700> being<00:06:00.880> attacked

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
to get away once they're being attacked

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.550 
to get away once they're being attacked
and<00:06:01.330> moved<00:06:01.600> these<00:06:01.690> stalkers<00:06:01.990> back<00:06:02.290> and<00:06:02.470> that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
and moved these stalkers back and that

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.110 
and moved these stalkers back and that
was<00:06:02.680> just<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.919> huge<00:06:03.160> blunder<00:06:03.640> by<00:06:03.820> me<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:04.030> was

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
was just a huge blunder by me I was

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.850 
was just a huge blunder by me I was
getting<00:06:04.330> too<00:06:04.480> cocky<00:06:04.720> there<00:06:04.990> I<00:06:05.020> thought<00:06:05.200> man<00:06:05.830> I

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
think I think I could take Huck right

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.020 
think I think I could take Huck right
now<00:06:07.720> but<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:08.890> was<00:06:09.010> stupid<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.610> me<00:06:09.640> I'm<00:06:09.820> such

of the geezers like rank 3 on the
ladders<00:06:15.010> he<00:06:15.130> was<00:06:15.250> ranked<00:06:15.490> one<00:06:15.730> but<00:06:16.000> he's<00:06:16.210> like

really close to 2,000 points right now
on<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.280> ladder<00:06:18.490> and<00:06:18.580> that's<00:06:19.330> just<00:06:19.600> insane

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
on the ladder and that's just insane

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.430 
on the ladder and that's just insane
this<00:06:20.230> guy<00:06:20.350> is<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.650> beast<00:06:21.340> and<00:06:22.110> yeah<00:06:23.110> so<00:06:23.320> I<00:06:23.350> see

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
this guy is a beast and yeah so I see

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.350 
this guy is a beast and yeah so I see
his<00:06:23.830> push<00:06:24.250> moving<00:06:24.610> out<00:06:24.730> through<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.120> middle

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
his push moving out through the middle

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.730 
his push moving out through the middle
and<00:06:25.540> this<00:06:25.840> is<00:06:25.960> not<00:06:26.050> going<00:06:26.140> to<00:06:26.200> be<00:06:26.320> really<00:06:26.710> good

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
and this is not going to be really good

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.500 
and this is not going to be really good
for<00:06:26.980> my<00:06:27.130> stalkers<00:06:27.730> here<00:06:27.940> this<00:06:28.060> is<00:06:28.180> all<00:06:28.360> it's

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
for my stalkers here this is all it's

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.480 
for my stalkers here this is all it's
warping<00:06:28.990> and<00:06:29.110> I<00:06:29.260> think<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.770> put<00:06:29.950> those<00:06:30.070> Eltsin

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
warping and I think I put those Eltsin

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.730 
warping and I think I put those Eltsin
too<00:06:30.640> early<00:06:30.940> these<00:06:31.480> stalkers<00:06:31.810> just<00:06:32.230> these

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.190 
zealous is dying and then these stalkers
not<00:06:35.110> going<00:06:35.320> to<00:06:35.380> get<00:06:35.530> Mike<00:06:35.830> road<00:06:36.070> at<00:06:36.250> all<00:06:36.310> and
