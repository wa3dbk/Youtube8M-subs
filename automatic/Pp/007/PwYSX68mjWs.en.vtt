tension in the sheet metal we've added a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
very dramatic and muscular flair to it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.160 
very dramatic and muscular flair to it
in<00:01:16.259> designer<00:01:16.650> language<00:01:17.299> which<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.659> think

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
in designer language which I think

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
in designer language which I think
really<00:01:19.350> ramps<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> appeal<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.880> car

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
really ramps up the appeal of the car

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
really ramps up the appeal of the car
and<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.680> appeal<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> customers<00:01:23.220> as

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and we think will appeal to customers as

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
and we think will appeal to customers as
well<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:24.240> competitive<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> lastly<00:01:25.560> in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
well how competitive is it lastly in

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
all the mid-size and compact segments

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
all the mid-size and compact segments
are<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> battleground<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
are going to be the battleground as we

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
are going to be the battleground as we

kind of hurdle toward 2016 and the new

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
kind of hurdle toward 2016 and the new
fuel<00:01:47.909> economy<00:01:48.360> standards<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
fuel economy standards that we have to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.000 
fuel economy standards that we have to
meet<00:01:49.530> here

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
meet here

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.710 
meet here
we<00:01:50.100> found<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.400> half<00:01:50.520> miles<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.910> gallon<00:01:50.940> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
we found a half miles a gallon so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.000 
we found a half miles a gallon so
there's<00:01:51.930> only<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.170> couple<00:01:52.230> lovers<00:01:52.620> you<00:01:52.830> can

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
there's only a couple lovers you can

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.680 
there's only a couple lovers you can
pull<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.550> you're<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.910> get<00:01:54.240> increased

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
pull when you're going to get increased

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.650 
pull when you're going to get increased
fuel<00:01:54.840> economy<00:01:55.260> size<00:01:55.650> weight<00:01:56.660> aerodynamics

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
fuel economy size weight aerodynamics

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.190 
fuel economy size weight aerodynamics
right<00:01:57.870> and<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.700> everybody<00:02:00.300> is<00:02:00.390> coming<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
right and so everybody is coming to the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
right and so everybody is coming to the
car<00:02:01.410> side<00:02:01.680> rather<00:02:02.040> than<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.370> truck<00:02:02.550> side<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
car side rather than the truck side to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.360 
car side rather than the truck side to
do<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.870> it's<00:02:04.080> much<00:02:04.260> tougher<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.830> with

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
do that it's much tougher to do with

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.850 
do that it's much tougher to do with
full-size<00:02:05.760> trucks<00:02:06.230> compact<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.470> subcompact

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
full-size trucks compact and subcompact

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400 
full-size trucks compact and subcompact
cars<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.390> battleground<00:02:09.960> is<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
cars or where the battleground is and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.050 
cars or where the battleground is and
everybody<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.040> entering<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.990> very

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
everybody is entering that very

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.310 
everybody is entering that very
ferociously<00:02:15.060> because<00:02:15.510> that's<00:02:16.020> where<00:02:16.200> they

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
ferociously because that's where they

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.840 
ferociously because that's where they
can<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> fuel<00:02:16.920> economy<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.670> you're

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
can get the fuel economy so you're

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.550 
can get the fuel economy so you're
looking<00:02:18.270> at<00:02:18.360> competitors<00:02:18.870> who<00:02:19.020> really<00:02:19.320> didn't

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
looking at competitors who really didn't

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.160 
looking at competitors who really didn't
focus<00:02:19.710> on<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.220> market<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.570> past<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
focus on that market in the past and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.560 
focus on that market in the past and
kind<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.530> given<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:23.030> now<00:02:24.030> having<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.450> move

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
kind of given it up now having to move

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.060 
kind of given it up now having to move
back<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.290> you're<00:02:25.470> seeing<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.770> lot<00:02:26.040> of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
back and so you're seeing a lot of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.230 
back and so you're seeing a lot of
interest<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.540> side<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> market
