00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
lot of these times you can't find the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.310

same<00:00:34.380> exact<00:00:34.739> button<00:00:35.030> yay<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.870> need<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

go<00:00:39.899> ahead<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.410> use<00:00:40.620> black<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
go ahead and just use black now when it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.670 
go ahead and just use black now when it
comes<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.270> sewing<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.660> button<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.230> have

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
comes to sewing a button if you have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160 
comes to sewing a button if you have
thread<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:45.030> harder<00:00:45.660> than

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
thread that's a little bit harder than

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
thread that's a little bit harder than
your<00:00:46.350> regular<00:00:46.500> average<00:00:46.969> medium<00:00:47.969> weight<00:00:48.149> it's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
your regular average medium weight it's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
your regular average medium weight it's
good<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.100> strong<00:00:50.460> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
good because you want it to be strong so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.389 
good because you want it to be strong so
that<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.180> hold<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:52.949> comes<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that it will hold so here comes the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
that it will hold so here comes the
hardest<00:00:53.730> part<00:00:53.850> step<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.930> threading<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
hardest part step one threading the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.049 
hardest part step one threading the
needle<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:57.170> take<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.410> thread<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> very

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
needle I take my thread and I get a very

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
needle I take my thread and I get a very
sharp<00:01:00.449> point<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.890> what

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
sharp point on it because that's what

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.240 
sharp point on it because that's what
will<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.370> easiest<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.570> thread<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
will be easiest to thread then I take a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
will be easiest to thread then I take a
needle<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> good<00:01:06.150> size<00:01:06.470> heavyweight

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
needle that's a good size heavyweight

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.250 
needle that's a good size heavyweight
needle<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> nice<00:01:08.280> sized<00:01:08.580> opening<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
needle with a nice sized opening so I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
needle with a nice sized opening so I
aim<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> thread<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> hole<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
aim the thread right at the hole in the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.490 
aim the thread right at the hole in the
needle<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.890> called<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> eye<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> needle

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
needle it's called the eye of the needle

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.280 
needle it's called the eye of the needle
once<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.960> take<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.140> other

once you get it there I take my other
finger<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> pull<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> through<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.570> want

of thread whenever you do a button you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.969 
of thread whenever you do a button you
double<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.130> thread<00:01:27.110> once<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.500> my<00:01:28.650> thread

let's<00:01:47.010> begin<00:01:47.250> sewing<00:01:47.730> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.120> button<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
let's begin sewing on the button the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
let's begin sewing on the button the
first<00:01:49.080> thing<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.350> need<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:50.070> find<00:01:50.490> the

from the previous button I'm going to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.650 
from the previous button I'm going to
take<00:02:23.370> advantage<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.630> to

take advantage of that and I'm going to
go<00:02:24.780> ahead<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.380> start<00:02:25.860> my<00:02:26.160> first<00:02:26.850> hole<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
go ahead and start my first hole in the

go ahead and start my first hole in the
back<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.380> reason<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.830> begin<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.580> back

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
back the reason we begin it in the back

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.630 
back the reason we begin it in the back
is<00:02:30.030> because<00:02:30.210> our<00:02:31.080> thread<00:02:31.590> knot<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
is because our thread knot is in the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160 
is because our thread knot is in the
back<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> don't<00:02:33.300> want<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.930> seen

back and you don't want that to be seen

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.440 
back and you don't want that to be seen
on<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> front<00:02:34.560> side<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.000> pull<00:02:36.300> this

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
on the front side so you pull this

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.040 
on the front side so you pull this
through<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.320> when<00:02:37.560> you're<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:38.330> stops<00:02:39.330> you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
thread right through that hole so this

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.610 
thread right through that hole so this
process<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:56.300> stitch<00:02:57.300> on<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.750> fabric<00:02:58.350> which
