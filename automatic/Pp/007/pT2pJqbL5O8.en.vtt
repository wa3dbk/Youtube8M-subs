you're<00:00:13.679> having<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.040> first<00:00:14.519> question<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.969> you

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you're having a first question to you

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.460 
you're having a first question to you
the<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.299> red<00:00:15.480> flag<00:00:15.509> I'm<00:00:15.900> sure<00:00:16.020> might<00:00:16.320> have

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the first red flag I'm sure might have

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.900 
the first red flag I'm sure might have
been<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.130> taking<00:00:17.490> place<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
been that this was taking place in a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.080 
been that this was taking place in a
hotel<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.630> also<00:00:19.010> silicone<00:00:20.010> injections<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:20.939> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
hotel but also silicone injections as it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.090 
hotel but also silicone injections as it
relates<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.359> state<00:00:21.990> law<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> talk<00:00:23.039> about

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
relates to state law can you talk about

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.790 
relates to state law can you talk about
that<00:00:24.650> well<00:00:25.650> actually<00:00:26.269> state<00:00:27.269> law<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.840> unclear

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that well actually state law is unclear

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 
that well actually state law is unclear
I<00:00:29.010> think<00:00:29.340> there<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.730> studies<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.240> are

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
I think there are some studies that are

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.709 
I think there are some studies that are
being<00:00:31.140> performed<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.630> under<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
being performed by the under the

auspices of the FDA looking specifically

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
auspices of the FDA looking specifically
at<00:00:36.510> whether<00:00:36.719> silicone<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.410> safe<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
at whether silicone is safe but in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.940 
at whether silicone is safe but in
general<00:00:38.730> silicone<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> given<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.899> small<00:00:40.469> small

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
general silicone is given in small small

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.750 
general silicone is given in small small
amounts<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.940> called<00:00:42.149> micro<00:00:42.540> droplet<00:00:43.020> form

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
amounts it's called micro droplet form

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
amounts it's called micro droplet form
whereas<00:00:44.760> these<00:00:45.239> injections<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.989> presume<00:00:46.590> were

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
whereas these injections I presume were

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
whereas these injections I presume were
in<00:00:47.070> large<00:00:47.430> quantities<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.719> an<00:00:48.840> area<00:00:49.020> that's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
in large quantities to an area that's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.130 
in large quantities to an area that's
relatively<00:00:49.890> unsafe<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> unforgiving<00:00:51.390> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
relatively unsafe and unforgiving so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
relatively unsafe and unforgiving so
let's<00:00:52.500> talk<00:00:52.680> about<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.100> patient<00:00:53.340> police<00:00:53.820> are

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
let's talk about the patient police are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400 
let's talk about the patient police are
telling<00:00:54.120> us<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> woman<00:00:54.750> complained<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
telling us that the woman complained of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.279 
telling us that the woman complained of
chest<00:00:55.469> pain<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> trouble<00:00:57.000> breathing<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.899> now

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
chest pain and trouble breathing and now

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
chest pain and trouble breathing and now
the<00:00:58.350> autopsy<00:00:59.070> results<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.520> not<00:00:59.550> been

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the autopsy results have not been

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
the autopsy results have not been
released<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.449> yet<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> don't<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.500> exact

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
released as yet so you don't have exact

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
released as yet so you don't have exact
knowledge<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.489> exactly<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.239> happened<00:01:03.600> with

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
knowledge of exactly what happened with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
knowledge of exactly what happened with
this<00:01:03.780> woman's<00:01:04.110> treatment<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this woman's treatment but what do you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
this woman's treatment but what do you
think<00:01:05.850> could<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.570> gone<00:01:06.869> wrong<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
think could have gone wrong with this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
think could have gone wrong with this
with<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.369> silicone<00:01:08.670> perhaps<00:01:09.240> being

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
with so much silicone perhaps being

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.840 
with so much silicone perhaps being
injected<00:01:11.030> well<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> sounds<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.710> like

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
injected well it sounds very much like

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.300 
injected well it sounds very much like
the<00:01:14.850> silicone<00:01:15.689> may<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> migrated<00:01:16.619> into<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the silicone may have migrated into the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.999 
the silicone may have migrated into the
vessels<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.600> made<00:01:18.869> its<00:01:19.049> way<00:01:19.259> into<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> lungs

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
vessels and made its way into the lungs

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.910 
vessels and made its way into the lungs
and<00:01:20.220> cause<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.670> called<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> pulmonary<00:01:21.210> embolus

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
and cause was called a pulmonary embolus

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.789 
and cause was called a pulmonary embolus
which<00:01:23.420> either<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.600> micro<00:01:24.930> emboli<00:01:25.320> form<00:01:25.619> which

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
which either in micro emboli form which

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.649 
which either in micro emboli form which
are<00:01:25.920> small<00:01:26.250> emboli<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> large<00:01:27.150> embolus

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
are small emboli or a large embolus

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.380 
are small emboli or a large embolus
could<00:01:27.930> result<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.640> disruption<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> breathing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
could result in disruption of breathing

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
could result in disruption of breathing
an<00:01:30.869> eruption<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.890> ventilation<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
an eruption of ventilation so that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.539 
an eruption of ventilation so that
oxygenation<00:01:33.900> wouldn't<00:01:34.409> occur<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.310> heart

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
oxygenation wouldn't occur and the heart

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.460 
oxygenation wouldn't occur and the heart
could<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.240> stopped<00:01:36.900> her<00:01:37.110> an<00:01:37.229> arrhythmia

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
could have stopped her an arrhythmia

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.560 
could have stopped her an arrhythmia
heart<00:01:38.189> could<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.430> beat<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.030> funny<00:01:39.299> fashion

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
heart could have beat in a funny fashion

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170 
heart could have beat in a funny fashion

this route and enhance the buttocks if
you<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.149> safe<00:01:45.390> procedures

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you will there are safe procedures

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.370 
you will there are safe procedures
aren't<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.920> might<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.899> well<00:01:48.899> these

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
aren't there what might be well these

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
aren't there what might be well these
procedures<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.100> incidentally<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.850> don't

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
procedures which incidentally I don't

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.080 
procedures which incidentally I don't
