00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.590
 with the largest amount of scientific information there to carry out to extend 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.340
 artists of first level palicki of them civilians and union for all 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.320
 the ages I imagine 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 be in another era 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.500
 that the psc is unreachable

 adding 863 thousand american dollars 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.160
 it's a drama because 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.950
 for barak regions to tuck their own

 a joint work project that is a great example for the development of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.960
 the cities and the towns 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.890
 through tourism 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.379
 and I'm sure that the tourism that comes from his being a bullfighter 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.589
 fundamental for economic activity 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.799
 this city is going to have a strong because the power 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 we can find who criticizes this respect is life-size 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.379
 to the great dinosaur specimens that populated the earth millions of years ago 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.119
 years and of course the interesting thing is that unlike the elections of this

 who ruled the heavens of the earth for millions of years 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.190
 when you are well prepared next to the replica that is amazed at 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.489
 see how small the human being suffers in front 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.959
 to the nature 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.029
 and the scientists and artists of this park were also created patients 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.229
 evolution of the planet and with much success 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.399
 it is a very big satisfaction brown 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.809
 to be able to extend my work 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.369
 of finishing finally I do not see a 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.079
 every person who sees 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.959
 that is in a stew of marvelous of these or 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.229
 of these evils 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.839
 and as if that were not enough, they also did their habitat 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.969
 especially with his painting 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.329
 it is in sucre where it was found in the largest natural extension of footprints 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.659
 of dinosaurs 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.959
 different plants such as banking a very big google tree 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.469
 it's not a pine but it looks like the first one for what it would do that is a tree that 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.469
 existed in the time of the dinosaurs 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.430
 It also shows the joint work of paleontologists and 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.109
 foreign scientists 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.339
 who fused their knowledge with the perfect and delicate work said fini 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.029
 Bolivian Zapatistas 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.159
 It is very important to highlight new 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.159
 support 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.219
 the eleven of samuel doria medina 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.050
 I want 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.400
 a little this classic Colombian conservative party 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.110
 a unique match 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.569
 and of unprecedented features of which there are no global references that 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:35.740
 I will remove 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.599
 i that this way on day 2 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.270
 there are those who visit it 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.949
 at the spot hour 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.949
 I would like to bring my relatives from the United States 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.469
 the partition that traffic 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.139
 described by experts as a magnificent work of prehistoric art 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.460
 of the 21st century 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.349
 complement its magnificence 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.349
 the Spanish driver of the team 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.319
 that for its great value for the history of mankind 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.389
 has been compared to the pyramids of Egypt 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.460
 but I think it's important to put the political heritage 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.809
 also for the world heritage 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.909
 but it is the largest the most important deposit of traces of 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:17.849
 dinosaurs 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.749
 that we have on this planet 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.779
 the cretaceous park and that keeps it from the world of 2010 in the 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.069
 angels are distances with the leader 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
 where chopped 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.690
 that will be to make this park by creators can learn 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.240
 the parade begins 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.060
 this reality
