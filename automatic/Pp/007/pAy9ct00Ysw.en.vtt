you can go through all movable objects
that<00:02:26.290> make<00:02:26.500> sense<00:02:26.710> cars<00:02:27.100> airplanes<00:02:27.430> tanks

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that make sense cars airplanes tanks

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.380 
that make sense cars airplanes tanks
jets<00:02:28.810> when<00:02:29.530> they<00:02:29.820> pretty<00:02:30.820> much<00:02:30.880> airplanes

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390

trains fences like you saw me go through
their<00:02:35.020> movable<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.710> because<00:02:35.890> they're

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
their movable like because they're

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.560 
their movable like because they're
destructible<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.760> stuff<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.150> you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
destructible and stuff like that you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.360
