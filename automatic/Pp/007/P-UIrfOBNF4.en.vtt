Best MMO

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.240
MMOs in my opinion have always been kind of a-

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.280
A dog's genre, if you will

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.640
You spend your time grinding and killing mobs

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.880

World of Warcraft has pretty much been the only one

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.820
Until BioWare this year decided to come out

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.540

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.560
You think hockey

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.800
