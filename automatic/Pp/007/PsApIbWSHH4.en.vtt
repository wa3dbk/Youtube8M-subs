00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
did I saw LMGs running around with red

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.249 
did I saw LMGs running around with red
dots<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:05.210> was<00:06:05.360> just<00:06:05.449> crazy<00:06:05.599> and<00:06:05.839> not<00:06:06.020> only<00:06:06.139> that

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
dots it was just crazy and not only that

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.260 
dots it was just crazy and not only that
but<00:06:06.409> the<00:06:06.620> game<00:06:06.800> types<00:06:07.069> as<00:06:07.250> well<00:06:07.279> I<00:06:07.460> think<00:06:07.639> if<00:06:08.029> we

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
but the game types as well I think if we

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.200 
but the game types as well I think if we
were<00:06:08.449> to<00:06:08.629> introduce<00:06:09.199> that<00:06:09.560> game<00:06:09.830> type<00:06:10.099> I<00:06:10.699> don't

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
were to introduce that game type I don't

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.480 
were to introduce that game type I don't
I<00:06:11.419> think<00:06:11.629> it's<00:06:11.719> like<00:06:11.889> it's<00:06:12.889> like<00:06:12.979> multiple

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
I think it's like it's like multiple

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.909 
I think it's like it's like multiple
team<00:06:13.729> deathmatch<00:06:14.180> and<00:06:14.509> I<00:06:15.469> think<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:15.860> would

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
team deathmatch and I think that would

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.260 
team deathmatch and I think that would
be<00:06:16.039> good<00:06:16.069> I<00:06:16.250> think<00:06:16.370> it's<00:06:16.610> fun<00:06:16.819> I<00:06:16.849> think<00:06:17.029> it's

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
be good I think it's fun I think it's

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.659 
be good I think it's fun I think it's
cool<00:06:17.419> to<00:06:17.479> watch<00:06:17.719> you<00:06:18.169> know<00:06:18.289> three<00:06:18.979> teams<00:06:19.279> of

cool to watch you know three teams of

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.180 
cool to watch you know three teams of

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.240 
are really good like you know on that
same<00:06:35.899> skill<00:06:36.199> level<00:06:36.229> it's<00:06:36.800> just<00:06:37.009> going<00:06:37.130> to<00:06:37.159> be

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
same skill level it's just going to be

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.900

entertaining

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
entertaining

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.640 
entertaining
and<00:06:38.150> not<00:06:38.570> only<00:06:38.660> that<00:06:38.780> but<00:06:38.900> I<00:06:39.050> think<00:06:39.140> Treyarch

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
and not only that but I think Treyarch

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.610 
and not only that but I think Treyarch
has<00:06:39.910> something<00:06:40.910> planned<00:06:41.120> with<00:06:41.450> the<00:06:41.540> maps<00:06:41.780> it

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
has something planned with the maps it

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.320 
has something planned with the maps it
looks<00:06:42.800> like<00:06:42.920> they<00:06:43.040> are<00:06:43.700> really<00:06:44.060> paying

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
looks like they are really paying

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.150 
looks like they are really paying
attention<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.470> know<00:06:45.590> what<00:06:45.770> hashed<00:06:45.980> row

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
attention to you know what hashed row

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.220 
attention to you know what hashed row
has<00:06:46.340> to<00:06:46.520> say<00:06:46.700> about<00:06:46.970> the<00:06:47.270> maps<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:47.840> trying<00:06:48.140> to

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
has to say about the maps and trying to

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.050 
has to say about the maps and trying to
keep<00:06:48.320> them<00:06:48.470> symmetrical<00:06:49.040> and<00:06:49.250> so<00:06:49.790> on<00:06:49.910> and<00:06:50.000> so

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
keep them symmetrical and so on and so

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.690 
keep them symmetrical and so on and so
forth<00:06:50.180> so<00:06:50.630> um<00:06:51.440> if<00:06:51.890> there's<00:06:52.220> anything<00:06:52.460> that

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
forth so um if there's anything that

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.070 
forth so um if there's anything that
could<00:06:52.850> be<00:06:52.940> bad<00:06:53.120> about<00:06:53.150> this<00:06:53.510> game<00:06:53.690> the<00:06:53.900> only

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
could be bad about this game the only

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.460 
could be bad about this game the only
thing<00:06:54.230> left<00:06:54.440> that<00:06:54.530> I<00:06:54.650> could<00:06:54.890> say<00:06:55.070> is<00:06:55.310> the<00:06:55.580> maps

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
thing left that I could say is the maps

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.600 
thing left that I could say is the maps
that's<00:06:57.470> the<00:06:57.620> only<00:06:57.800> possible<00:06:58.310> thing<00:06:58.550> that

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
that's the only possible thing that

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.850 
that's the only possible thing that
could<00:06:58.940> be<00:06:58.970> bad<00:06:59.300> about<00:06:59.330> this<00:06:59.840> game<00:07:00.080> is<00:07:00.320> the<00:07:00.650> maps

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
could be bad about this game is the maps
