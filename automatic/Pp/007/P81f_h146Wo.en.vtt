00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
course this microfiber cloth to clean
off<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.329> display<00:01:03.780> before<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.710> put<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.040> on

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
off the display before you put it on

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.140 
off the display before you put it on
course<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.640> wanna<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.290> dirty<00:01:12.920> and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
course you don't wanna have it dirty and
then<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.390> course<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.560> most<00:01:16.710> important<00:01:17.130> thing

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
then of course the most important thing

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
then of course the most important thing
it's<00:01:17.520> top<00:01:17.759> four<00:01:18.000> millimeters<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.990> thickness

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it's top four millimeters in thickness

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.390 
it's top four millimeters in thickness
and<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> cool<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.200> with

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
and the cool thing I think with

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.010 
and the cool thing I think with
especially<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.520> speedy<00:01:23.820> ins<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> their

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
especially with speedy ins and their

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.649 
especially with speedy ins and their
glass<00:01:25.380> screen<00:01:25.890> protectors<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.630> are

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
glass screen protectors is that they are

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.859 
glass screen protectors is that they are
coming<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.710> rounded<00:01:29.460> borders<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.540> sides

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
coming with rounded borders on the sides

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
coming with rounded borders on the sides
so<00:01:31.380> they've<00:01:31.860> been<00:01:32.009> thinking<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.579> bit

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so they've been thinking a little bit

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420 
so they've been thinking a little bit
about<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> soft<00:01:34.380> border<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
about that that has like a soft border I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.230 
about that that has like a soft border I
do<00:01:35.850> prefer<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.820> have

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
do prefer that and I see here we do have

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.469 
do prefer that and I see here we do have
a<00:01:39.930> thing<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.590> says<00:01:41.040> back<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
a thing here says back so this is the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.100 
a thing here says back so this is the
back<00:01:42.899> side<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.430> use<00:01:44.670> push<00:01:45.180> off<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:48.110> then

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
back side that you use push off and then

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
back side that you use push off and then
of<00:01:49.259> course<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.909> probably<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.130> read

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
of course you do probably want to read

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.539 
of course you do probably want to read
the<00:01:54.060> instructions<00:01:54.630> even<00:01:55.020> though<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
the instructions even though it

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
the instructions even though it
shouldn't<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.240> super<00:01:58.110> hard<00:01:59.899> but<00:02:00.899> I've

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
shouldn't be that super hard but I've

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
shouldn't be that super hard but I've
always<00:02:01.530> been<00:02:01.770> horrible<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.640> putting<00:02:03.090> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
always been horrible at putting on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.530 
always been horrible at putting on
things<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:08.479> yeah<00:02:09.479> we'll<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:11.540> see

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
things so yeah we'll see about that see

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:24.119 
things so yeah we'll see about that see
here<00:02:12.750> should<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.110> put

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.589 

so<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:25.220> should<00:02:25.519> probably<00:02:25.549> push<00:02:26.030> here<00:02:26.360> from

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
so you should probably push here from

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.649 
so you should probably push here from
the<00:02:26.689> middle<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.739> see<00:02:28.129> how<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.579> pans<00:02:29.120> out<00:02:29.420> oh

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
the middle and see how it pans out oh

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.229 
the middle and see how it pans out oh
wow<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:30.319> extremely<00:02:30.829> easy<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.549> let's

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
wow that was extremely easy to do let's

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:45.369 
wow that was extremely easy to do let's
see<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.599> if<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:32.959> should<00:02:33.260> use<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.739> one<00:02:44.379> so

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
see here if we should use this one so

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.020 
see here if we should use this one so
now<00:02:46.629> we<00:02:47.629> do<00:02:47.900> get<00:02:48.260> some<00:02:48.590> nice<00:02:49.310> protection<00:02:49.849> over

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
now we do get some nice protection over
