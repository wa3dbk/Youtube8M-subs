00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
assumptions about other people as well

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.130 
assumptions about other people as well
and<00:02:11.950> almost<00:02:12.459> invariably<00:02:13.329> these<00:02:13.630> assumptions

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and almost invariably these assumptions

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.009 
and almost invariably these assumptions
are<00:02:14.700> completely<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.880> totally<00:02:16.060> wrong<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.840> one

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
are completely and totally wrong and one

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.090 
are completely and totally wrong and one
of<00:02:17.109> the<00:02:17.170> things<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.410> really<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.739> about<00:02:17.799> this
