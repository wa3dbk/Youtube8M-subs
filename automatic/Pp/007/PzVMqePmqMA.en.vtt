00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.729 
see I have seven minutes so pay close
attention<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.450> my<00:03:43.510> VC<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.080> see<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.260> still<00:03:44.560> have

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
attention to my VC you see I still have

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.970 
attention to my VC you see I still have
40<00:03:45.300> 1830<00:03:46.300> I'm<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.200> load<00:03:47.350> this<00:03:47.530> game<00:03:47.769> up

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
40 1830 I'm going to load this game up

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.640 
40 1830 I'm going to load this game up
this<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.299> only<00:03:49.630> downside<00:03:50.140> of<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.350> VC

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
this is the only downside of the VC

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.460 
this is the only downside of the VC
glitch<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:52.120> loading<00:03:52.450> times<00:03:52.690> are<00:03:52.930> about<00:03:53.110> 20

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
glitch to the loading times are about 20

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.960 
glitch to the loading times are about 20
seconds<00:03:53.860> I'm<00:03:54.100> going<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.340> let<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.580> one<00:03:54.640> play

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
seconds I'm going to let this one play

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.229 
seconds I'm going to let this one play
out<00:03:55.680> each<00:03:56.680> file<00:03:57.069> from<00:03:57.489> loading<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.030> and

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
out each file from loading it and

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.210 
out each file from loading it and
playing<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.900> out<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.290> then<00:03:59.440> exiting<00:04:00.069> it

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
playing it out and then exiting it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.550 
playing it out and then exiting it
probably<00:04:00.910> takes<00:04:01.120> about<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.420> minute<00:04:01.630> maybe<00:04:02.380> a

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
probably takes about a minute maybe a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.850 
probably takes about a minute maybe a
little<00:04:02.769> bit<00:04:02.980> more<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.630> now<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.319> have<00:04:05.590> 5

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
little bit more so I have now I have 5

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.610 
little bit more so I have now I have 5
to<00:04:06.040> 12<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:07.480> could<00:04:07.660> take<00:04:07.900> me<00:04:08.049> like<00:04:08.230> five<00:04:08.440> to

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
to 12 so it could take me like five to

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.979 
to 12 so it could take me like five to
seven<00:04:08.890> minutes<00:04:08.980> each<00:04:09.280> time<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:10.450> boom<00:04:10.780> look

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
seven minutes each time so boom look

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.650 
seven minutes each time so boom look
familiar<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.739> down<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.519> ball<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:13.360> dribble

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
familiar in down the ball just dribble

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.420 
familiar in down the ball just dribble
it<00:04:13.750> out<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.670> that's<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.359> game<00:04:16.510> right<00:04:16.690> there

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
it out and that's the game right there

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.610 
it out and that's the game right there
so<00:04:18.430> like<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.729> said<00:04:18.789> earlier<00:04:19.030> it's<00:04:19.989> not<00:04:20.200> really<00:04:20.590> a

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
so like I said earlier it's not really a

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.279 
so like I said earlier it's not really a
glitch<00:04:21.120> you're<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.330> playing<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> game<00:04:22.930> you
