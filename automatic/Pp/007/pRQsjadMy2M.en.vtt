00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.670
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:12.010
 The theme of the World Rubber Market is this one 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:18.310
 I will try to do a large forehand drive here 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:20.550
 It is contents this time It is person who is confident in forehand swing speed more than middle class person 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 Especially recommended 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 Are you guys a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.829
 When I say drive , I think that it is mostly to hit the ball that came out from ancient times 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.780
 The drive to be introduced this time is on that table 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.949
 Because it becomes a drive to sell with Zdorn, a quick attack that does not give time to the other party 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.730
 It is Toka If you want to 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:45.600
 It is especially recommended for those who are good at power play who want to attack hard at the fore 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 Yes 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.079
 As you watched in animation now 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.570
 One of you Toka half-hearted but Mr. poking not come out or leave 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:06.920
 I ventured something like hard hit even waiting exiting from the base or the go hit over the platform 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 After that, it seems like a halfway stop like a stop becoming a little more poppy 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.469
 It is also very effective against the ball It is the best to aim at such balls more and more 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.440
 If you are 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:21.290
 I think I can say 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.650
 Yes, I would like to explain the point at which I will do this forehand drive 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.420
 think 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.930
 The first First, it is the angle of the racket of the angle racket 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.260
 Please face downward 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 If you put up a racket here 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:46.590
 It looks like it's like pulling the front of the ball on a table 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:52.190
 Then, do not put the rotation well , if you face the face of the racket firmly the edge of the ball 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 Racket be able to rub Please do set up in for a firm is 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.860
 The second point is 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.159
 It is a back swing. A back swing is not lower than the height of the platform . 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.740
 Not lowered in the intention to bloom platform 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:13.319
 Ne is that catching the always high backswing Please be aware that Tteyuu 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.700
 If you lower the racket here, it may be possible to open it on the table tennis table when it falls. 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.709
 Will be higher 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.520
 I will not be able to swing forward ahead on the platform, so I always pull a high back swing 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:28.460
 Please be conscious 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.370
 It is anyway third point of try to Fu Tteyuu early faster swing speed 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.209
 please 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.550
 It is the top of the ball because it is directed as a racket as an image 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:44.340
 It is an image like rubbing the top of the ball tightly 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:48.870
 I feel like bring up the other side of the court Omoikkiri the ball with force to this 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.970
 Please do it with such an image Anyway, swing the ball quickly 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.440
 Please be aware that you will go to rubbing 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.440
 It is such a feeling as an image 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:08.250
 It is as an image It shakes the racket parallel on a stand in the feeling like now, and a ball 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.870
 It is an image like rubbing your head 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:19.250
 I think it would be nice if you could do it with such an image 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:21.480
 As recommended practice how to practice methods do is I of the ball of their own, as I did now 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.980
 Bounce on the coat 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.750
 this 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.040
 Shook 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.860
 this 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.940
 The live of the square soon 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.140
 The swing speed of the racquet 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:42.300
 I think that I want you to remember that racket angle firmly afterward 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.860
 This time it is if that can be so made is I go doing it asked to actually put out the soul 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.600
 But at first 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.850
 It is recommended for'll enter the back side you recommend the do on the back side 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.890
 why 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:57.730
 When I do it in front of the table and say 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:02.650
 It is difficult to swing because the body can not enter in the table tennis table or in the way 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:07.510
 The first is that the back is get done I entered the such side in such of 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:12.650
 First of all because we will become an easy-to-remember form of say firmly You're captured the way of the ball 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:18.229
 At first try it there. If you get used to doing it there then firmly 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:22.820
 It's like you're ready to move and then hit and you'll be able to hit everything from anywhere 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:27.759
 I think that you can remember tempo well if you do it in the procedure 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.759
 Yes please see that I tried it in actually carried out
