starts<00:02:33.950> picking<00:02:34.129> back<00:02:34.400> up<00:02:34.459> at<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.849> spring<00:02:35.590> so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590

different parts of the town I want to

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.440 
different parts of the town I want to
keep<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.739> video<00:03:01.720> pretty<00:03:02.720> short<00:03:03.110> if<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:04.519> can<00:03:04.819> or

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
keep this video pretty short if I can or

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.720 
keep this video pretty short if I can or
if<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.290> runs<00:03:06.440> too<00:03:06.739> long<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.099> might<00:03:07.250> break<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.640> up

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
if it runs too long I might break it up

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.559 
if it runs too long I might break it up
into<00:03:07.910> two<00:03:08.209> parts<00:03:09.549> but<00:03:10.549> they<00:03:10.790> have<00:03:10.970> they<00:03:11.450> have

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
into two parts but they have they have

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.830 
into two parts but they have they have
them<00:03:11.720> all<00:03:11.870> here<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:14.030> actually<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
them all here it's actually just on the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.599 
them all here it's actually just on the
left<00:03:15.079> it's<00:03:15.319> called<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.560> Kalispell<00:03:16.069> Center<00:03:16.400> mall

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
left it's called a Kalispell Center mall

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.100 
left it's called a Kalispell Center mall
there's<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.329> hotel<00:03:17.630> attached<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.470> it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
there's a hotel attached to it

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.320 
there's a hotel attached to it
I<00:03:19.200> actually<00:03:19.650> haven't<00:03:20.010> seen<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.580> hotel<00:03:21.000> attached

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
I actually haven't seen a hotel attached

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.500 
I actually haven't seen a hotel attached
to<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> mall<00:03:21.840> ever<00:03:22.250> but<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.610> guess<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.210> business

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
to a mall ever but I guess the business

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.090 
to a mall ever but I guess the business
plan<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.930> kind<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.230> sound<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.620> actually<00:03:25.920> makes

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
plan is kind of sound it actually makes

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.980 
plan is kind of sound it actually makes
sense

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.890 

so<00:03:29.470> what<00:03:30.130> I'm<00:03:30.220> going<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.400> do<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.480> second

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
so what I'm going to do in just a second

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.300 
so what I'm going to do in just a second
here<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:34.080> I'm<00:03:35.080> going<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.500> me<00:03:35.970> right<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:38.310> then

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
here is I'm going to me right and then

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.630 
here is I'm going to me right and then
you'll<00:03:39.520> be<00:03:39.550> able<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.970> see<00:03:41.010> see<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.190> mountains

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
you'll be able to see see the mountains

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.110 
you'll be able to see see the mountains
off<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.360> distance<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.730> I'm<00:03:45.820> going<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:45.970> make

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
off in the distance so I'm going to make

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.210 
off in the distance so I'm going to make
a<00:03:46.150> right<00:03:46.420> here<00:03:46.690> on<00:03:46.840> my<00:03:47.020> way<00:03:47.200> to

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.490 

and<00:03:50.670> one<00:03:51.390> thing<00:03:51.570> I've<00:03:51.720> noticed<00:03:52.140> here<00:03:52.350> is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.020

very well organized agricultural base
and<00:04:50.800> there's<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.889> lot<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.190> people<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.610> have

and<00:05:00.839> then<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.139> you<00:05:01.229> see<00:05:01.439> off<00:05:01.589> in<00:05:01.619> the<00:05:01.860> distance

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
and then if you see off in the distance

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.040 
and then if you see off in the distance
you<00:05:02.429> can<00:05:02.490> see<00:05:02.669> some<00:05:02.879> of<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.029> mountains<00:05:03.419> and

there

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370

and<00:05:19.820> they<00:05:20.600> also<00:05:20.720> have<00:05:21.020> weekly<00:05:21.230> rentals

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420

and<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:25.290> Finnegan's

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990

and the Finnegan's
said<00:05:27.290> there

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.880

and they actually have a small water

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.040 
and they actually have a small water
park<00:05:34.340> I<00:05:34.670> think<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.240> stays<00:05:35.450> open<00:05:35.660> through

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
park I think it stays open through

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.170 
park I think it stays open through
October<00:05:36.710> they<00:05:37.010> have

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.630 

so<00:05:40.810> if<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:40.960> want<00:05:41.140> to<00:05:41.170> do<00:05:41.320> any<00:05:41.500> swimming<00:05:41.860> many

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
so if you want to do any swimming many

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.560 
so if you want to do any swimming many

they<00:06:34.949> call<00:06:35.130> the<00:06:35.220> summer<00:06:35.430> tourist<00:06:35.699> season<00:06:35.910> and

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
they call the summer tourist season and

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.930 
they call the summer tourist season and
they<00:06:36.449> have<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.660> ski<00:06:36.990> season<00:06:37.440> which<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:38.310> believe

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
they have a ski season which I believe

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.930 
they have a ski season which I believe
starts<00:06:39.509> in<00:06:39.919> November

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
starts in November

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.750 
starts in November
but<00:06:42.540> I<00:06:42.920> don't<00:06:43.920> think<00:06:44.130> that<00:06:44.250> the<00:06:44.340> ski<00:06:44.550> season

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
but I don't think that the ski season

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.400 
but I don't think that the ski season
gets<00:06:45.090> nowhere<00:06:45.390> near<00:06:45.540> as<00:06:45.660> busy<00:06:45.900> as<00:06:46.110> what<00:06:46.290> the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
gets nowhere near as busy as what the

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.350 
gets nowhere near as busy as what the
summer<00:06:46.650> season<00:06:46.920> does<00:06:47.280> it<00:06:47.910> seen<00:06:48.030> a<00:06:48.120> lot<00:06:48.330> of

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
summer season does it seen a lot of

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.350 
summer season does it seen a lot of
place<00:06:48.750> in<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.140> area<00:06:49.290> from<00:06:49.770> Alberta<00:06:50.580> and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
place in the area from Alberta and

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.130 
place in the area from Alberta and
British<00:06:51.570> Columbia

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
British Columbia

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.830 
British Columbia
and<00:06:53.500> I've<00:06:53.950> seen<00:06:54.100> some<00:06:54.340> from<00:06:54.520> North<00:06:54.760> Dakota<00:06:54.840> and

Wyoming<00:06:56.310> but<00:06:57.310> most<00:06:57.520> most<00:06:57.910> of<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.180> place<00:06:58.450> I

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
Wyoming but most most of the place I

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.250 
Wyoming but most most of the place I
would<00:07:00.130> say<00:07:00.310> nearly<00:07:00.610> 80%<00:07:01.390> of<00:07:01.510> them<00:07:01.630> maybe<00:07:02.140> a

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
would say nearly 80% of them maybe a

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.720 
would say nearly 80% of them maybe a
little<00:07:02.470> bit<00:07:02.650> higher<00:07:02.770> than<00:07:03.010> that<00:07:03.070> or<00:07:03.370> Montana

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
little bit higher than that or Montana
