00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
now although soil covers most of the

now although soil covers most of the
landscape<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:21.240> don't<00:00:21.450> often<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.230> because

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
landscape we don't often see it because

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.280 
landscape we don't often see it because
it's<00:00:22.860> obscured<00:00:23.250> by<00:00:23.610> vegetation<00:00:24.239> be<00:00:25.079> that

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
it's obscured by vegetation be that

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's obscured by vegetation be that
grass<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:26.040> woodland<00:00:26.759> or<00:00:26.910> agricultural<00:00:27.900> crops

grass or woodland or agricultural crops

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.409 
grass or woodland or agricultural crops
and<00:00:28.470> therefore<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.579> don't<00:00:29.730> often<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.060> about

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
and therefore we don't often think about

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.670 
and therefore we don't often think about
some<00:00:31.020> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.500> soils<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:33.030> us

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
some of the things that soils do for us

some of the things that soils do for us
you<00:00:34.680> may<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.399> 2015<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> going

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you may not know but 2015 is the going

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.170 
you may not know but 2015 is the going
to<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> International<00:00:38.219> Year<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> soils

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
to be the International Year of soils

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.779 
to be the International Year of soils
and<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.410> may<00:00:40.590> very<00:00:40.800> well<00:00:40.920> ask<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> question

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
and you may very well ask the question

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.029 
and you may very well ask the question
well<00:00:42.180> why<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.539> we<00:00:42.719> need<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.350> soils

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
well why do we need to have soils

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.720 
well why do we need to have soils
represented<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:45.269> an<00:00:45.420> international<00:00:46.050> year<00:00:46.730> for

represented by an international year for

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.799 
represented by an international year for
me<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.600> several<00:00:48.960> reasons<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:50.190> example

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
me there are several reasons for example

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.259 
me there are several reasons for example
80%<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.929> the<00:00:52.019> food<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.530> eat<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.100> grown<00:00:53.969> in

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
80% of the food that we eat is grown in

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.489 
80% of the food that we eat is grown in
soil<00:00:54.769> also<00:00:55.769> we<00:00:56.699> grow<00:00:57.420> crops<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.929> from<00:00:58.350> which

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
soil also we grow crops that from which

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.250 
soil also we grow crops that from which
we<00:00:58.679> can<00:00:58.859> make<00:00:58.890> clothes<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.699> fibers<00:01:00.269> generated

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
we can make clothes so fibers generated

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.310 
we can make clothes so fibers generated
from<00:01:01.589> crops<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.190> grown<00:01:02.339> in<00:01:02.370> soil<00:01:03.320> soils

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
from crops that are grown in soil soils

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
from crops that are grown in soil soils
can<00:01:04.980> also<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.430> used<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> grow<00:01:06.030> energy<00:01:06.510> crops<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
can also be used to grow energy crops so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.650 
can also be used to grow energy crops so
for<00:01:07.200> example<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.890> field<00:01:08.070> behind<00:01:08.550> me<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
for example in the field behind me as a

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.630 
for example in the field behind me as a
crop<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:09.990> elephant<00:01:10.560> grass<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.400> burnt

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
crop of elephant grass that can be burnt

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.060 
crop of elephant grass that can be burnt
in<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> power<00:01:12.180> station<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.650> generate

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
in a power station and to generate

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
in a power station and to generate
electricity<00:01:15.590> soils<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.860> also<00:01:17.220> trap<00:01:18.150> rainfall

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
electricity soils can also trap rainfall

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.310 
electricity soils can also trap rainfall
and<00:01:19.290> prevent<00:01:20.100> flooding<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:20.940> occurring<00:01:21.540> in

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
and prevent flooding from occurring in

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
and prevent flooding from occurring in
the<00:01:22.440> landscape<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.130> has<00:01:23.460> been<00:01:23.760> very

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the landscape and that has been very

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.750 
the landscape and that has been very
important<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.170> UK<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> last<00:01:26.280> year

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
important in the UK in the last year

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.570 
important in the UK in the last year
where<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.420> had<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> heavy<00:01:28.800> rainfall<00:01:29.070> in

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
where we had a lot of heavy rainfall in

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.000 
where we had a lot of heavy rainfall in
the<00:01:30.090> South<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.450> England<00:01:30.540> where<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.620> can<00:01:31.770> manage

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
the South of England where we can manage

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.930 
the South of England where we can manage
soils<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.760> we<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.450> prevent<00:01:33.720> flooding<00:01:34.940> soils

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
soils well we can prevent flooding soils

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.690 
soils well we can prevent flooding soils
also<00:01:36.240> contain<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.950> large<00:01:38.220> amount<00:01:38.550> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
also contain a very large amount of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.990 
also contain a very large amount of
carbon<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.920> there's<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.010> twice<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.790> much

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
carbon and there's about twice as much

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.750 
carbon and there's about twice as much
carbon<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.780> soils<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> equivalently

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
carbon in soils as there is equivalently

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.390 
carbon in soils as there is equivalently
in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.390> atmosphere<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.620> important

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
in the atmosphere so it's very important

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.670 
in the atmosphere so it's very important
in<00:01:47.880> respect<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.510> climate<00:01:49.410> change<00:01:51.380> despite<00:01:52.380> all

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
in respect of climate change despite all

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.610 
in respect of climate change despite all
those<00:01:52.920> things<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.550> soils<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.540> us<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:55.020> we

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
those things that soils do for us if we

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.490 
those things that soils do for us if we
don't<00:01:55.800> manage<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.400> well<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:58.320> don't

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
don't manage them well then they don't

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
don't manage them well then they don't
perform<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:59.130> those<00:01:59.370> functions<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.360> for

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
perform all those functions so for

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
perform all those functions so for
example<00:02:01.050> if<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.620> don't<00:02:01.800> care<00:02:02.010> for<00:02:02.190> our<00:02:02.310> soils

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
example if we don't care for our soils

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.790 
example if we don't care for our soils
carefully<00:02:03.150> then<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.930> erode<00:02:04.410> from<00:02:04.440> the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
carefully then they can erode from the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.449 
carefully then they can erode from the
landscape<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:06.080> we<00:02:07.080> take<00:02:07.290> farm<00:02:07.680> machinery<00:02:08.129> on

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
landscape if we take farm machinery on

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.029 
landscape if we take farm machinery on
to<00:02:08.670> soils<00:02:09.030> when<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> too<00:02:10.319> wet<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to soils when it is too wet then the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.000 
to soils when it is too wet then the
source<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.640> become<00:02:12.000> compacted<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:13.010> crops

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
source can become compacted and crops

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.530 
source can become compacted and crops
that<00:02:14.160> are<00:02:14.280> grown<00:02:14.430> them<00:02:14.640> won't<00:02:14.820> grow<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.330> well
