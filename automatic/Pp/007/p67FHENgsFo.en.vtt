what's up Brandon Lily here for the
power<00:00:02.970> project<00:00:03.710> got<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> really<00:00:04.980> good<00:00:05.220> question

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
power project got a really good question

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.519 
power project got a really good question
today<00:00:05.910> about<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> build<00:00:06.720> strings<00:00:07.350> and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
today about how to build strings and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.850 
today about how to build strings and
explosiveness<00:00:08.099> off<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.580> floor<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.710> for<00:00:10.710> me

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
explosiveness off the floor and for me

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.980 
explosiveness off the floor and for me
my<00:00:11.490> problem<00:00:11.910> has<00:00:12.030> always<00:00:12.120> been<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.450> lockout

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
my problem has always been the lockout

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.890 
my problem has always been the lockout
in<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.950> deadlift<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.639> I'll<00:00:15.210> say<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> few<00:00:15.839> things

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
in the deadlift so I'll say a few things

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
in the deadlift so I'll say a few things
that<00:00:16.260> I've<00:00:16.379> always<00:00:16.650> done<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.310> deadlift

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that I've always done and my deadlift

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.650 
that I've always done and my deadlift
that<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:19.230> helped<00:00:19.500> me<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:20.539> you<00:00:21.539> know

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that if I think helped me be you know

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.330 
that if I think helped me be you know
more<00:00:21.869> explosive<00:00:22.380> than<00:00:22.410> most<00:00:22.740> guys<00:00:22.890> off<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
more explosive than most guys off the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.630 
more explosive than most guys off the
floor<00:00:23.580> what<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.279> really

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
floor what I do a lot of is I'm really

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
floor what I do a lot of is I'm really
dedicated<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> speed<00:00:27.510> work<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.109> keep<00:00:28.680> my

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
dedicated to speed work I keep my

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 
dedicated to speed work I keep my
percentage<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.460> low<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.000> line<00:00:30.210> whereas

minivan<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:41.969> helps<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
minivan and that really helps the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.380 
minivan and that really helps the
explosion<00:00:42.989> through<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.160> technique<00:00:44.550> other

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
like a pin to pin 3 awkward positions

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.869 
like a pin to pin 3 awkward positions
that<00:00:55.110> start<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.649> hamstrings<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> glutes

and a little bit of a awkward position

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.240 
and a little bit of a awkward position
compared<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> pulling<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> floor<00:01:01.649> when

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
compared to pulling from the floor when

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.650 
compared to pulling from the floor when
you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.789> body<00:01:02.940> underneath<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you can get your body underneath you a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.789 
you can get your body underneath you a
little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.019> better<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.470> build<00:01:04.710> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
little bit better and build that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
little bit better and build that
explosion<00:01:05.280> by<00:01:06.240> pulling<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> pin<00:01:07.020> 2<00:01:07.200> or

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
explosion by pulling from the pin 2 or

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
explosion by pulling from the pin 2 or
the<00:01:07.439> pin<00:01:07.650> 3<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.700> creates<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.420> level<00:01:09.869> where

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the pin 3 that creates a level where

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
the pin 3 that creates a level where
your<00:01:10.680> body's<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.369> perfect<00:01:11.580> position

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
your body's not in the perfect position

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
your body's not in the perfect position
to<00:01:12.119> pull<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.650> last<00:01:13.920> thing<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.430> really

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to pull the last thing that's really

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.030 
to pull the last thing that's really
started<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> help<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> lot<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> reverse

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
started to help me a lot is the reverse

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300 
started to help me a lot is the reverse
man<00:01:17.310> dead<00:01:17.610> lift<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.740> does<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
man dead lift because what it does is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.460 
man dead lift because what it does is
the<00:01:20.430> reverse<00:01:20.729> man<00:01:21.020> accelerates<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> bar<00:01:22.350> off

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the reverse man accelerates the bar off

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.920 
the reverse man accelerates the bar off
the<00:01:22.619> floor<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> extend

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the floor but because I want to extend

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.990 
the floor but because I want to extend
that<00:01:25.049> acceleration<00:01:25.680> through<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> top<00:01:26.340> I'm

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that acceleration through the top I'm

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
that acceleration through the top I'm
really<00:01:27.420> pulling<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> hardest<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.950> floor

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
really pulling the hardest off the floor

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510 
really pulling the hardest off the floor
to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> bar<00:01:30.329> moving<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.290> even<00:01:32.280> though<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to get the bar moving so even though the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.749 
to get the bar moving so even though the
band<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.000> helping<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.799> weight<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.159> overloaded

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
band is helping the weight is overloaded

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.789 
band is helping the weight is overloaded
by<00:01:35.880> ten<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.329> fifteen<00:01:36.659> percent<00:01:37.049> dis<00:01:37.290> depending

by ten to fifteen percent dis depending

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.819 
by ten to fifteen percent dis depending
and<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.320> trying<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and you know what I'm trying to do is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.670 
and you know what I'm trying to do is
pull<00:01:41.189> absolutely<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.180> hard<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.780> from

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
pull absolutely as hard as I can from

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
pull absolutely as hard as I can from
the<00:01:43.860> word<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.329> acceleration

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the word go so that my acceleration

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
the word go so that my acceleration
continues<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.829> through<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> top

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
continues all the way through the top

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
continues all the way through the top
where<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> problem<00:01:48.360> blocking<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
where I have the problem blocking the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
where I have the problem blocking the
way<00:01:49.409> doubt<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.520> those<00:01:50.759> things<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
way doubt if you do those things you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.260 
way doubt if you do those things you
know<00:01:51.780> use<00:01:52.049> accurate<00:01:52.619> speed<00:01:52.890> weights<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
know use accurate speed weights do the
