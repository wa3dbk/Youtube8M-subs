now has a solar panel on top here has a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.089 
now has a solar panel on top here has a
switch<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.449> can't<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.560> turn<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.980> off

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
switch so you can't you can turn it off

switch so you can't you can turn it off
if<00:00:27.199> you'd<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.380> to

that's one criticism I have about it
the<00:00:39.950> they're<00:00:40.950> easy<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> tip<00:00:41.460> over<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:42.270> like

down<00:00:55.550> there's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> couple<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.120> Iran

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
down there's a couple of them in Iran

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.430 
down there's a couple of them in Iran
right<00:00:57.600> now<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:00.989> auto<00:01:01.109> shut

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
right now and if you have an auto shut

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.969 
right now and if you have an auto shut
off<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.370> closer<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> light

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
off so the closer I get to the light

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
off so the closer I get to the light
you'll<00:01:04.979> turn<00:01:05.159> itself<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> go<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you'll turn itself off and go over here

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
you'll turn itself off and go over here
turn<00:01:06.840> itself<00:01:07.080> back<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.070> notice<00:01:08.490> these

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
turn itself back on if you notice these

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.890 
turn itself back on if you notice these
are<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.810> different<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.320> colors

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this is a little more purple than that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
this is a little more purple than that
one<00:01:14.220> ATM<00:01:15.210> tell<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.600> camera<00:01:17.030> but<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.750> LEDs<00:01:19.110> are

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
one ATM tell on camera but the LEDs are

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.630 
one ATM tell on camera but the LEDs are
just<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> little<00:01:19.799> bit<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.580> are

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just a little bit different these are

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
just a little bit different these are
really<00:01:21.030> dim<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.560> these

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
really dim just because they got these

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.020 
really dim just because they got these
from<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> store<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.820> haven't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
from the store and they really haven't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
from the store and they really haven't
been<00:01:24.150> sitting<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> daylight<00:01:25.189> and

been sitting in the daylight and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
been sitting in the daylight and
charging<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:28.549> close<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.790> those<00:01:29.909> Street<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
charging now close for those Street I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.080 
charging now close for those Street I
did<00:01:30.780> take<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.140> apart<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> here's<00:01:32.939> your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
did take one apart so here's your

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.109 
did take one apart so here's your
lampshade<00:01:33.710> just<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.829> piece<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.549> plastic

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
lampshade just a piece of plastic

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.160 
lampshade just a piece of plastic
whatever<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:40.290> tag<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:40.829> slower<00:01:41.400> lamp

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
whatever is tag right here slower lamp

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.789 
whatever is tag right here slower lamp
let's<00:01:43.170> see

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.910 

featuring<00:01:46.799> an<00:01:47.340> on/off<00:01:47.880> switch<00:01:48.799> powered<00:01:49.799> by

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
featuring an on/off switch powered by

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580 
featuring an on/off switch powered by
solar<00:01:50.100> panel<00:01:51.110> recharges<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.140> battery<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
solar panel recharges the battery and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.969 
solar panel recharges the battery and
under<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> under<00:01:53.340> direct<00:01:54.060> sunlight<00:01:54.979> built-in

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
under and under direct sunlight built-in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
under and under direct sunlight built-in
sensor<00:01:56.369> automatically<00:01:56.790> turns<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.270> light<00:01:57.420> off

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
sensor automatically turns the light off

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810 
sensor automatically turns the light off
at<00:01:57.750> night<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.350> these<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.130> didn't<00:01:59.610> Center

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
at night so these actually didn't Center

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
at night so these actually didn't Center
it<00:01:59.939> under<00:02:00.210> sunlight<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:00.960> still<00:02:01.200> charged

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it under sunlight and they still charged

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.690 
it under sunlight and they still charged
up<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.920> that's<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.430> pretty<00:02:02.549> good

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
up so that's actually a pretty good

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.050 
up so that's actually a pretty good
panel<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.500> precautions<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> there's<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
panel and the precautions so there's the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.670 
panel and the precautions so there's the
bottom<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.509> it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.759 

like<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.340> said<00:02:12.400> holo<00:02:13.140> seems<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.290> sealed<00:02:14.620> up

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
like I said holo seems to be sealed up

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.790 
like I said holo seems to be sealed up
too<00:02:15.040> pretty<00:02:15.340> well<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.080> could<00:02:17.290> put<00:02:17.500> water

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
too pretty well so you could put water

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.680 
too pretty well so you could put water
in<00:02:18.099> there<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.519> mean<00:02:23.040> here's<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.099> stem<00:02:27.690> which

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
in there I mean here's the stem which

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.690 
in there I mean here's the stem which
snaps<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.620> then<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.280> goes<00:02:30.459> in

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
snaps in and then just that just goes in

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.780 
snaps in and then just that just goes in
here<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:32.110> us<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:38.500> here's<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:38.920> here's<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
here for us then here's that here's the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.130 
here for us then here's that here's the
piece<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.180> here<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.510> actually<00:02:40.540> does<00:02:40.989> all

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
piece right here that actually does all

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.199 
piece right here that actually does all
the<00:02:41.319> work<00:02:42.360> floor<00:02:43.360> panel<00:02:44.849> actually<00:02:45.849> has<00:02:45.940> three

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
the work floor panel actually has three

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.970 
the work floor panel actually has three
LEDs<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:48.599> we<00:02:49.599> can<00:02:49.720> focus<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:52.209> can

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
LEDs in it we can focus on that you can

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.729 
LEDs in it we can focus on that you can
probably<00:02:53.980> bend<00:02:54.340> these<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:55.590> go<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> little

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
probably bend these to go a little

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.589 
probably bend these to go a little
