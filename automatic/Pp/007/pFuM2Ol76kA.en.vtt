nuts they're just crazy and then you

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.160 
nuts they're just crazy and then you
have<00:02:55.580> your<00:02:55.670> penny<00:02:55.880> writing<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.870> back

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
there in all red and then in the front I

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.800 
there in all red and then in the front I
actually<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.270> way<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.630> logo

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
actually like the way that this logo

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.430 
actually like the way that this logo
looks<00:03:03.110> better<00:03:03.320> but<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.800> uh<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:05.200> red<00:03:06.200> with

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
looks better but it's uh it's red with

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.550 
looks better but it's uh it's red with
the<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:07.610> white<00:03:07.820> inside<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.900> there<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.290> thought

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
the the white inside of there I thought

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.260 
the the white inside of there I thought
that<00:03:09.709> would<00:03:09.830> have<00:03:09.920> been<00:03:09.950> cool<00:03:10.250> if<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.790> was

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
that would have been cool if it was

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.730 
that would have been cool if it was
stitched<00:03:11.690> in<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.290> with<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.590> white

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
stitched in like that with the white

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.250 
stitched in like that with the white
inners<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:14.150> like<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.720> front<00:03:14.990> here

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
inners just like it is on the front here

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.500 
inners just like it is on the front here
but<00:03:15.890> it's<00:03:16.160> not<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.610> that's<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.209> know<00:03:17.330> that's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
but it's not so that's you know that's

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.210 
but it's not so that's you know that's
just<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.810> personal<00:03:17.990> thing<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.980> then<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.130> have

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
just a personal thing and then you have

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.479 
just a personal thing and then you have
a<00:03:19.280> white<00:03:19.430> swoosh<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.800> then<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.920> bottom<00:03:22.250> is

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
a white swoosh and then the bottom is

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.150 
a white swoosh and then the bottom is
entirely<00:03:23.150> clear<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.320> not<00:03:24.410> tinted<00:03:24.980> or

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
entirely clear it's not tinted or

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.770 
entirely clear it's not tinted or
anything<00:03:25.760> like<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.330> know<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.600> lot<00:03:26.750> of

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
anything like that I know a lot of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.290 
anything like that I know a lot of
people<00:03:27.019> don't<00:03:27.170> like<00:03:27.350> tinted<00:03:28.070> outsoles<00:03:28.489> and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
people don't like tinted outsoles and

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.880 
people don't like tinted outsoles and
then<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.870> have<00:03:29.959> your<00:03:30.080> penny<00:03:30.260> branding<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:30.800> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
then you have your penny branding on the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.150 
then you have your penny branding on the
bottom<00:03:31.190> as<00:03:31.310> well<00:03:31.489> with<00:03:31.820> red<00:03:32.060> traction<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.230> of

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
bottom as well with red traction so of

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.430 
bottom as well with red traction so of
course<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.550> have<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> carbon<00:03:35.060> fiber

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
course you have a carbon fiber

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.600 
course you have a carbon fiber
throughout<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:36.709> got<00:03:36.830> all<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.100> really<00:03:37.459> nice

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
throughout it's got all that really nice

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.160 
throughout it's got all that really nice
texture<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:41.600> think<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.080> these

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
texture to it and I I think that these

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.290 
texture to it and I I think that these
actually<00:03:42.410> fit<00:03:42.709> true<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:42.980> size<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.670> know<00:03:44.030> that

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
actually fit true to size I know that

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.490 
actually fit true to size I know that
the<00:03:44.989> eggplants<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.769> have<00:03:45.980> from<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.410> want<00:03:48.410> to

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
the eggplants that I have from I want to

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
say they're from 2010 it was not the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.520 
say they're from 2010 it was not the
first<00:03:50.330> release<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.840> was<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.019> second<00:03:51.380> one

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
those ones a bit really tight in the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
that I've gotten afterwards which isn't

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.280 
that I've gotten afterwards which isn't
many<00:03:59.000> I've<00:03:59.209> only<00:03:59.390> had<00:03:59.570> one<00:03:59.630> other<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.170> that's

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
many I've only had one other one that's

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.920 
many I've only had one other one that's
left<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.739> pro<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.220> retro<00:04:01.580> blue<00:04:01.820> those<00:04:02.690> ones

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
left the pro the retro blue those ones

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.420 
left the pro the retro blue those ones
fit<00:04:03.140> true<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.380> size<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.010> did<00:04:04.160> these<00:04:04.250> as

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
fit true to size and so did these as

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.320 
fit true to size and so did these as
well<00:04:04.610> so<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:06.290> with<00:04:06.380> your<00:04:06.590> regular<00:04:06.680> size<00:04:07.330> that's

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
well so go with your regular size that's

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.490 
well so go with your regular size that's
just<00:04:08.510> my<00:04:08.630> recommendation<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:11.140> yeah<00:04:12.140> that's

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
just my recommendation and yeah that's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.170 
just my recommendation and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:12.590> much<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.130> I<00:04:13.400> mean<00:04:13.640> there's<00:04:13.850> not<00:04:13.970> much

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
pretty much it I mean there's not much

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.030 
pretty much it I mean there's not much
to<00:04:14.299> go<00:04:14.420> over<00:04:14.720> because<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:15.140> it's<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.680> solid

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
to go over because it's it's a solid

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.710 
to go over because it's it's a solid
colorway<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:19.040> know<00:04:19.269> again<00:04:20.269> I'm<00:04:20.419> not<00:04:20.540> sure

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
colorway and you know again I'm not sure

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.960 
colorway and you know again I'm not sure
where<00:04:20.870> they're<00:04:20.989> gonna<00:04:21.080> release<00:04:21.320> but<00:04:21.970> wherever

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
where they're gonna release but wherever

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.000 
where they're gonna release but wherever
they<00:04:23.270> release<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.750> should<00:04:23.900> be<00:04:24.050> interesting<00:04:24.979> to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
they release it should be interesting to

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.620 
they release it should be interesting to
see<00:04:25.220> how<00:04:25.370> well<00:04:25.580> they<00:04:25.760> sell<00:04:26.000> caz<00:04:26.330> foams
