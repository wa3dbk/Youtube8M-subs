today the professor says if we give it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.149 
today the professor says if we give it
water<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.349> lots<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.739> light<00:03:29.950> for

photosynthesis it'll grow into a plant
how<00:03:34.150> long<00:03:34.329> do<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.540> think<00:03:34.599> it'll<00:03:34.930> take<00:03:34.989> mama

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
how long do you think it'll take mama

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.800 
how long do you think it'll take mama
well<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.519> might<00:03:36.730> have<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.120> give<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.540> little

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
well you might have to give it a little

well you might have to give it a little
patience<00:03:38.230> too<00:03:38.440> because<00:03:39.099> plants<00:03:39.370> take<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.670> while

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
patience too because plants take a while

00:03:39.909 --> 00:04:53.490 
patience too because plants take a while
to<00:03:40.209> grow<00:03:41.730> okay<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.390> try<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:43.989> patient

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.860 

could<00:05:02.000> use<00:05:02.150> some<00:05:02.300> help<00:05:02.330> cutting<00:05:02.780> these

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
could use some help cutting these

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.629 
could use some help cutting these
cookies<00:05:03.760> okay

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.469

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
started to grow except mine Lizzy's even

perhaps<00:05:17.669> your<00:05:17.969> plant<00:05:18.240> needs<00:05:18.509> a<00:05:18.599> little<00:05:18.719> more

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
perhaps your plant needs a little more

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.260 
perhaps your plant needs a little more
time<00:05:19.169> but<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.009> have<00:05:20.249> to<00:05:20.279> take<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.699> back<00:05:20.819> to<00:05:21.029> class

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.149 
on Monday the professor's coming back to
see<00:05:23.969> how<00:05:24.090> our<00:05:24.120> plants<00:05:24.539> are<00:05:24.659> doing<00:05:25.159> everyone's

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
see how our plants are doing everyone's

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.249
