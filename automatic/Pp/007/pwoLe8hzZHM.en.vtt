00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.149 
course will be fully painted but this is
a<00:01:56.740> way<00:01:56.980> that<00:01:57.190> we<00:01:57.520> can<00:01:57.730> differentiate<00:01:58.210> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
a way that we can differentiate this

now it's kind of hard to see because of
the<00:02:09.959> translucent<00:02:10.709> nature<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> figure<00:02:11.610> but

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the translucent nature of the figure but

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.780

guards there but the crazy thing to

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
realize about this is that it's all

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.180 
realize about this is that it's all
built<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.810> Minimates<00:02:40.230> body<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
built on the Minimates body now it is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.130 
built on the Minimates body now it is
modified<00:02:41.879> slightly<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.629> not<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> same

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
modified slightly so it's not the same

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.380 
modified slightly so it's not the same
as<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.500> regular<00:02:43.680> minimates<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.150> pull

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
as the regular minimates but if we pull

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.640 
as the regular minimates but if we pull
the<00:02:45.480> whole<00:02:45.629> guy<00:02:45.780> apart<00:02:46.140> here<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:46.500> can

the whole guy apart here you can
actually<00:02:46.829> see<00:02:47.010> it's<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:48.000> brand-new<00:02:48.329> head<00:02:48.599> so

actually see it's a brand-new head so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 
actually see it's a brand-new head so
it's<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.140> standard<00:02:49.500> minimates<00:02:49.980> hen<00:02:50.220> it's

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
of minimates arms so this is just a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.140 
of minimates arms so this is just a
minimates<00:03:06.989> buck<00:03:07.579> with<00:03:08.579> these<00:03:08.760> brand-new

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
pieces on here now diamond did do a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.069 
pieces on here now diamond did do a
great<00:03:11.519> job<00:03:11.639> of<00:03:11.849> modifying<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.930> make<00:03:13.049> it

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
great job of modifying this to make it

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.330 
great job of modifying this to make it
look<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.440> something<00:03:13.680> different<00:03:14.250> because

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
look like something different because

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.490 
look like something different because
when<00:03:14.730> he's<00:03:14.910> all<00:03:15.060> put<00:03:15.269> together<00:03:15.359> he<00:03:16.200> doesn't

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
when he's all put together he doesn't

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.870 
when he's all put together he doesn't
just<00:03:16.590> look<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:16.799> your<00:03:17.099> standard<00:03:17.340> mini<00:03:17.670> mate

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
just look like your standard mini mate

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.659 
just look like your standard mini mate
he<00:03:18.690> looks<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.560> little<00:03:19.889> action<00:03:20.069> figure<00:03:20.549> and

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
he looks like a little action figure and

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.400 
he looks like a little action figure and
I<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.450> quite<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> bit<00:03:21.840> because<00:03:22.169> while

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
I like that quite a bit because while

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.470 
I like that quite a bit because while
the<00:03:22.530> mini<00:03:22.650> mates<00:03:22.889> are<00:03:23.069> cool<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:24.180> many<00:03:24.329> mates

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
the mini mates are cool the many mates

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.400 
the mini mates are cool the many mates
have<00:03:24.630> never<00:03:24.780> been<00:03:24.930> something<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.260> I've

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
have never been something that I've

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.559 
have never been something that I've
really<00:03:25.650> been<00:03:25.859> into<00:03:26.130> collecting<00:03:26.700> hardcore<00:03:27.209> so

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
really been into collecting hardcore so

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.180 
really been into collecting hardcore so
I<00:03:27.840> think<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.530> kind<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.799> neat<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.069> they

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
I think it's kind of neat that they

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.860 
I think it's kind of neat that they
modified<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.940> little<00:03:30.150> bit<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.599> made<00:03:30.750> it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
modified this a little bit and made it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.809 
modified this a little bit and made it
kind<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.109> its<00:03:31.260> own<00:03:31.470> thing<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
kind of its own thing it's not just the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.479 
kind of its own thing it's not just the
same<00:03:33.090> mini<00:03:33.750> made<00:03:33.989> bodies<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.709> are<00:03:34.769> just

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
same mini made bodies that are just

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.009 
same mini made bodies that are just
repainted<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.269> look<00:03:36.450> like<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.720> different

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
repainted to look like the different

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.629 
repainted to look like the different
characters<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:37.919> has<00:03:38.069> quite<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.400> bit

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
characters this actually has quite a bit

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.819 
characters this actually has quite a bit
of<00:03:38.730> sculpting<00:03:39.120> details<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.630> here<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.769> if

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
of sculpting details on here so if

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.020

you've ever had many mates before you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.220 
you've ever had many mates before you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
know what the articulation is pretty

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.390 
know what the articulation is pretty
much<00:03:43.319> going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:44.069> can<00:03:44.190> see<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
much going to be like you can see the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
this into the back of the figure there's

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.200 
this into the back of the figure there's
a<00:04:52.200> small<00:04:52.440> little<00:04:52.620> hole<00:04:52.800> back<00:04:52.980> here<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.120> can

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
a small little hole back here so we can

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.760 
a small little hole back here so we can
have<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.510> sword<00:04:54.780> on<00:04:55.020> his<00:04:55.050> back<00:04:55.350> which<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.740> a

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
really cool little detail and then the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.510 
really cool little detail and then the
sword<00:04:58.410> can<00:04:58.620> slide<00:04:58.830> out<00:04:58.980> of<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.100> sheath<00:04:59.370> and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.080 
sword can slide out of the sheath and
just<00:04:59.820> plug<00:05:00.030> into<00:05:00.270> his<00:05:00.480> other<00:05:00.720> minimates<00:05:01.230> hand

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.780 
so it is actually a pretty cool little
action<00:05:05.460> figure<00:05:06.890> alright<00:05:07.890> how<00:05:08.130> about<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.430> little

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
action figure alright how about a little

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.260 
action figure alright how about a little
bit<00:05:08.970> of<00:05:09.380> comparison<00:05:10.380> time<00:05:10.620> now<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.550> know<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:11.970> told

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
bit of comparison time now I know I told

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.510 
bit of comparison time now I know I told
you<00:05:12.390> guys<00:05:12.510> that<00:05:12.570> this<00:05:13.140> doesn't<00:05:13.770> actually<00:05:14.160> have

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
you guys that this doesn't actually have

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.740 
you guys that this doesn't actually have
anything<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.880> do<00:05:15.000> with<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.210> original<00:05:15.300> battle

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
anything to do with the original battle

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.270 
anything to do with the original battle
baseline<00:05:16.080> but<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.410> is<00:05:16.530> just<00:05:16.830> natural<00:05:17.010> to

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
baseline but it is just natural to

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.640 
baseline but it is just natural to
compare<00:05:17.760> these<00:05:18.000> guys<00:05:18.300> so<00:05:19.020> we<00:05:19.140> can<00:05:19.290> get<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.440> good

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
compare these guys so we can get a good

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.220 
compare these guys so we can get a good
look<00:05:19.890> at<00:05:20.070> them<00:05:20.190> side<00:05:20.370> by<00:05:20.400> side<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.200> see

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
look at them side by side you can see

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.680 
look at them side by side you can see
that<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.860> scales<00:05:23.220> are<00:05:23.490> very<00:05:23.820> similar<00:05:24.180> they're

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
that the scales are very similar they're

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.750 
that the scales are very similar they're
about<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.500> same<00:05:25.710> height<00:05:25.980> although<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.580> new

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
about the same height although the new

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.480 
about the same height although the new
one<00:05:26.970> from<00:05:27.180> diamond<00:05:27.690> is<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.840> little<00:05:28.260> bit<00:05:28.380> taller

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
one from diamond is a little bit taller

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.590 
one from diamond is a little bit taller
and<00:05:29.490> then<00:05:29.640> of<00:05:29.730> course<00:05:29.760> they<00:05:30.210> don't<00:05:30.330> really

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
and then of course they don't really

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.720 
and then of course they don't really
have<00:05:30.780> those<00:05:30.960> same<00:05:31.230> squat<00:05:31.830> poses<00:05:32.460> that<00:05:32.490> the

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
have those same squat poses that the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.850 
have those same squat poses that the
vintage<00:05:33.060> figures<00:05:33.390> had<00:05:33.660> these<00:05:34.440> are<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.650> little

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
vintage figures had these are a little

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.420 
vintage figures had these are a little
taller<00:05:35.520> looking<00:05:36.240> on<00:05:36.420> the<00:05:37.280> obviously<00:05:38.280> they've

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
taller looking on the obviously they've

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.400 
taller looking on the obviously they've
got<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:38.580> lot<00:05:38.760> more<00:05:38.790> pose<00:05:39.180> ability<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.870> then<00:05:40.260> of

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
got a lot more pose ability and then of

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.870 
got a lot more pose ability and then of
course<00:05:40.440> they're<00:05:40.860> lacking<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.370> rub<00:05:41.550> signs

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
course they're lacking the rub signs

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.000 
course they're lacking the rub signs
which<00:05:42.210> is<00:05:42.390> what<00:05:42.690> made<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.200> vintage<00:05:43.620> battle

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
which is what made the vintage battle

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.780 
which is what made the vintage battle
beasts<00:05:44.160> kind<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:44.880> special<00:05:46.430> but<00:05:47.430> this<00:05:47.580> way<00:05:47.730> you

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
beasts kind of special but this way you

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.090 
beasts kind of special but this way you
get<00:05:48.060> a<00:05:48.300> good<00:05:48.570> glimpse<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:49.170> what<00:05:49.560> these<00:05:49.800> look

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
get a good glimpse of what these look

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.800 
get a good glimpse of what these look
like<00:05:50.160> compared<00:05:50.850> to<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.210> vintage<00:05:51.510> figures

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
like compared to the vintage figures

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.629 
like compared to the vintage figures
that<00:05:51.990> we<00:05:52.080> all<00:05:52.230> love

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.249 

alright<00:05:58.639> so<00:05:58.879> in<00:05:59.149> the<00:05:59.269> end<00:05:59.389> I<00:05:59.629> do<00:05:59.749> think<00:06:00.109> this<00:06:00.199> is

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
alright so in the end I do think this is

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.019 
alright so in the end I do think this is
a<00:06:00.379> pretty<00:06:00.679> neat-looking<00:06:00.919> figure<00:06:01.519> the

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
a pretty neat-looking figure the

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.439 
a pretty neat-looking figure the
translucent<00:06:02.839> is<00:06:02.989> kind<00:06:03.319> of<00:06:03.409> cool<00:06:03.559> it's<00:06:03.799> very

translucent is kind of cool it's very

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.909 
translucent is kind of cool it's very
shiny<00:06:05.449> almost<00:06:05.899> like<00:06:06.019> a<00:06:06.049> piece<00:06:06.289> of<00:06:06.319> candy<00:06:06.649> is

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
shiny almost like a piece of candy is

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.069 
shiny almost like a piece of candy is

ones are going to look like I think I

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.109 
ones are going to look like I think I
like<00:06:12.679> those<00:06:12.889> actually<00:06:13.369> quite<00:06:13.579> a<00:06:13.609> bit<00:06:13.849> more

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
again it's an exclusive so I understand

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.879

for<00:06:28.909> you<00:06:28.969> I<00:06:29.299> know<00:06:29.779> that<00:06:30.229> I<00:06:30.499> think<00:06:30.919> this<00:06:31.039> is<00:06:31.159> a

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
for you I know that I think this is a

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:32.889 
for you I know that I think this is a
cool<00:06:31.369> looking<00:06:31.639> figure<00:06:31.879> and<00:06:32.179> I'm<00:06:32.299> anxious<00:06:32.869> to

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:32.899 
cool looking figure and I'm anxious to

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.269 
cool looking figure and I'm anxious to
see<00:06:33.019> what<00:06:33.319> else<00:06:33.439> diamonds<00:06:33.799> going<00:06:33.919> to<00:06:33.979> put<00:06:34.159> out

see what else diamonds going to put out

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.489 
see what else diamonds going to put out
but<00:06:34.669> this<00:06:35.479> doesn't<00:06:35.809> feel<00:06:35.899> like<00:06:36.019> a<00:06:36.079> battle

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:36.499 
but this doesn't feel like a battle

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:40.119 
but this doesn't feel like a battle
beast<00:06:36.679> to<00:06:36.859> me<00:06:37.009> and<00:06:37.269> I<00:06:38.319> kind<00:06:39.319> of<00:06:39.439> lost<00:06:39.739> a<00:06:39.979> little

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
beast to me and I kind of lost a little

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:41.829 
beast to me and I kind of lost a little
interest<00:06:40.519> in<00:06:40.699> this<00:06:40.849> knowing<00:06:41.329> that<00:06:41.479> it<00:06:41.599> doesn't

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:41.839 
interest in this knowing that it doesn't

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.059 
interest in this knowing that it doesn't
actually<00:06:41.989> have<00:06:42.319> anything<00:06:42.529> to<00:06:42.649> do<00:06:42.829> with<00:06:42.979> the

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
actually have anything to do with the

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.439 
actually have anything to do with the
original<00:06:43.249> battle<00:06:43.759> beasts<00:06:43.879> now<00:06:44.089> like<00:06:44.299> I<00:06:44.419> said

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
original battle beasts now like I said

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.079 
original battle beasts now like I said
I'm<00:06:44.839> going<00:06:45.139> to<00:06:45.319> still<00:06:45.589> see<00:06:45.919> what<00:06:46.639> they<00:06:46.819> put<00:06:47.059> out

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.089 
I'm going to still see what they put out

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.329 
I'm going to still see what they put out
because<00:06:47.569> the<00:06:48.229> figures<00:06:48.559> do<00:06:48.769> have<00:06:48.979> some<00:06:49.129> really

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:49.339 
because the figures do have some really

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.129 
because the figures do have some really
nice<00:06:49.489> sculpting<00:06:50.029> on<00:06:50.149> them<00:06:50.329> and<00:06:50.479> and<00:06:50.749> i<00:06:50.869> think

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
nice sculpting on them and and i think

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.599 
nice sculpting on them and and i think
the<00:06:51.259> designs<00:06:51.589> are<00:06:51.739> still<00:06:51.949> kind<00:06:52.069> of<00:06:52.189> cool<00:06:52.369> so

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:52.609 
the designs are still kind of cool so

00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:54.309 
the designs are still kind of cool so
I'm<00:06:52.729> still<00:06:52.999> curious<00:06:53.299> to<00:06:53.629> see<00:06:53.809> what<00:06:54.049> we<00:06:54.169> get

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
I'm still curious to see what we get

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.799 
I'm still curious to see what we get
released<00:06:54.679> but<00:06:55.249> at<00:06:55.369> this<00:06:55.609> point<00:06:55.939> I<00:06:56.239> am<00:06:56.479> actually

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:56.809 
released but at this point I am actually

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:59.379 
released but at this point I am actually
more<00:06:57.349> anxious<00:06:57.649> to<00:06:58.009> see<00:06:58.189> what<00:06:58.399> takara<00:06:58.909> is<00:06:59.119> doing

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
more anxious to see what takara is doing

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.339 
more anxious to see what takara is doing
with<00:06:59.569> the<00:06:59.749> Beast<00:07:00.109> fighters<00:07:00.859> figures<00:07:01.219> or<00:07:01.429> the

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
with the Beast fighters figures or the

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.449 
with the Beast fighters figures or the
Beast<00:07:03.349> formers<00:07:03.799> they're<00:07:04.009> actually<00:07:04.309> bringing

Beast formers they're actually bringing

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.789 
Beast formers they're actually bringing
back<00:07:04.729> the<00:07:04.879> beasts<00:07:05.059> formers<00:07:05.509> and<00:07:06.229> those<00:07:06.439> look

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:06.799 
back the beasts formers and those look

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:08.619 
back the beasts formers and those look
much<00:07:07.129> more<00:07:07.339> like<00:07:07.399> the<00:07:07.729> vintage<00:07:07.879> battle<00:07:08.360> be<00:07:08.479> so

if you haven't seen those yet just do a
search<00:07:10.189> for<00:07:10.249> it<00:07:10.519> and<00:07:10.639> check<00:07:10.789> them<00:07:10.939> out<00:07:11.059> maybe

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:11.629 
search for it and check them out maybe

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:13.179
