00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 Come and join and say 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.320
 already the plumbing will rise accompanying the relatives 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.329
 bisoli the duct that will lead the channel 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.169
 wear to the top of the seat 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.919
 on the bottom of the brick to be seated 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.050
 I make the amendment as an extension considering that this wall would receive 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 pottery 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.010
 to concrete at the height of two bricks with weaker action 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.170
 make an elevation without glue to support the field 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.490
 stay with paper to keep it directed until the concrete is dry 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.400
 soon the relatives with glue will reach provisional authoritative that sustained the 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 field 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.020
 if it is deemed necessary to amend the work 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 typical of the pipes following the recommendations 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.710
 the brick channel can conduct both hydraulic and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 horizontally 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.550
 for the repair of hydraulic installations there is no problem whatsoever r 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 move the bricks of the impaired area 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.860
 when replacing just remove the edges of the socket 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.340
 divide the bricks in half
