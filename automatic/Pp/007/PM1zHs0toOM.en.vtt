this possible is a part of the rear axle
it<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.590> called<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.459> differential<00:02:37.940> because<00:02:38.780> it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it is called the differential because it

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.960 
it is called the differential because it
can<00:02:39.109> drive<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> rear<00:02:39.680> wheels<00:02:40.010> at<00:02:40.340> different

complicated but once we understand its

complicated but once we understand its
principle<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.010> amazingly<00:02:46.700> simple<00:02:47.000> these

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
principle it is amazingly simple these

let's<00:02:56.329> fasten<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.780> spoke<00:02:57.049> on<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.459> inner<00:02:58.639> end<00:02:58.940> of

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
let's fasten a spoke on the inner end of

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.699 
let's fasten a spoke on the inner end of
each<00:02:59.540> axle<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.489> by<00:03:01.609> turning<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.000> spokes

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
each axle so that by turning the spokes

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.640 
each axle so that by turning the spokes
we<00:03:03.709> can<00:03:03.889> turn<00:03:04.130> each<00:03:04.370> wheel<00:03:04.639> separately<00:03:08.620> with<00:03:09.620> a

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
we can turn each wheel separately with a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.580 
we can turn each wheel separately with a
bar<00:03:09.980> or<00:03:10.250> cross<00:03:10.609> piece<00:03:10.959> we<00:03:11.959> can<00:03:12.170> turn<00:03:12.350> both

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
bar or cross piece we can turn both

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.520 
bar or cross piece we can turn both
wheels<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.459> same<00:03:13.730> direction<00:03:13.940> at<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.290> same

wheels in the same direction at the same
rate<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:15.950> speed<00:03:16.569> let's<00:03:17.569> get<00:03:17.750> something<00:03:18.079> to

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
rate of speed let's get something to

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.259 
rate of speed let's get something to
hold<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.440> bar<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.859> place<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.150> will

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269

what<00:03:36.920> happens<00:03:37.250> when<00:03:37.489> we<00:03:37.580> go<00:03:37.730> around<00:03:37.879> the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
what happens when we go around the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
we stop one wheel the other wheel won't

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.040 
we stop one wheel the other wheel won't
budge<00:03:52.320> let's<00:03:53.320> put<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.650> bar<00:03:53.920> on<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.280> pivot<00:03:55.050> so

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
budge let's put this bar on a pivot so

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.730 
budge let's put this bar on a pivot so
that<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.320> can<00:03:56.500> swing<00:03:56.800> in<00:03:57.010> either<00:03:57.280> direction

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.550 

now<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.240> bar<00:04:04.240> can<00:04:04.480> still<00:04:04.750> turn<00:04:04.990> both<00:04:05.230> wheels

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
now the bar can still turn both wheels

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.300 
now the bar can still turn both wheels
at<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.250> same<00:04:06.460> speed<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.710> because<00:04:08.710> it<00:04:08.980> pivots

at the same speed and because it pivots

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.870 
at the same speed and because it pivots
it<00:04:10.300> lets<00:04:10.600> one<00:04:10.810> wheel<00:04:11.050> turn<00:04:11.490> even<00:04:12.490> when<00:04:12.790> the

it lets one wheel turn even when the
