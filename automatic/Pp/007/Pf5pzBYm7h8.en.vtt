launch<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.549> train<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.630> hill

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
launch the train up the first hill

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
launch the train up the first hill
typically<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> roller<00:01:26.040> coaster<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.549> sort

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
typically with a roller coaster you sort

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960 
typically with a roller coaster you sort
of<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.500> chain<00:01:28.500> lift<00:01:28.920> mechanism<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
of have this chain lift mechanism that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.179 
of have this chain lift mechanism that
sort<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.329> slowly<00:01:30.900> pulls<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> hill<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
sort of slowly pulls it up the hill and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
sort of slowly pulls it up the hill and
then<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.400> Coast<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.650> similar<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
then you Coast down this similar to the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
then you Coast down this similar to the
system<00:01:35.400> used<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> rock<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.090> roller<00:01:36.390> coaster

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
speed as fast as possible that so that I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
speed as fast as possible that so that I
could<00:01:43.619> use<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.979> momentum<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.880> over

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
could use that momentum to get you over

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
could use that momentum to get you over
the<00:01:45.180> hill<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> what's<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.259> interesting

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the hill and what's really interesting

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.370 
the hill and what's really interesting
is<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.720> first<00:01:49.079> Hill

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
is that if you look at that first Hill

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.530 
is that if you look at that first Hill
and<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> couple<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.189> other<00:01:50.340> hills<00:01:50.670> you'll

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and a couple of other hills you'll

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.539 
and a couple of other hills you'll
notice<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:52.320> sort<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.009> closed

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
notice that there's sort of this closed

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.630 
notice that there's sort of this closed
half<00:01:53.970> closed<00:01:54.479> tunnel<00:01:55.110> around<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
half closed tunnel around it and that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.190 
half closed tunnel around it and that
actually<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> neat<00:01:57.750> trick<00:01:57.899> by<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
actually is a neat trick by the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.830 
actually is a neat trick by the
Imagineers<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.280> keep<00:01:59.790> within<00:02:00.030> noise

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
Imagineers to keep within noise

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.690 
Imagineers to keep within noise
restriction<00:02:01.619> guidelines<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
restriction guidelines that the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
restriction guidelines that the
attraction<00:02:03.000> needs<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.450> adhere<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.020> because

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
attraction needs to adhere to because

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
attraction needs to adhere to because
Disneyland<00:02:05.430> California<00:02:05.700> Adventure<00:02:06.149> is

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
Disneyland California Adventure is

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.600 
Disneyland California Adventure is
technically<00:02:06.960> next<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> residential<00:02:08.399> zone

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
technically next to a residential zone

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.669 
technically next to a residential zone
so<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.060> need<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:09.899> sure<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.379> sound

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so they need to make sure that the sound

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.530 
so they need to make sure that the sound
isn't<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.220> loud<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.000> no

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
isn't as loud as it no

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.360 
isn't as loud as it no
would<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.379> by<00:02:13.500> putting<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.010> tube

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
would be and so by putting that tube

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.459 
would be and so by putting that tube
there<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.879> you'll<00:02:15.269> always<00:02:15.420> notice<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
there and you'll always notice that the

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.649 
there and you'll always notice that the
tube<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.859> closed<00:02:17.280> off<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.150> same<00:02:18.450> direction

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
tube is closed off on the same direction

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.869 
tube is closed off on the same direction
which<00:02:19.109> is<00:02:19.230> facing<00:02:19.590> outward<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> outside

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
which is facing outward to the outside

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.660 
which is facing outward to the outside
of<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.209> park<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:22.319> redirects<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> sound

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
of the park it redirects the sound

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.880 
of the park it redirects the sound
inwards<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.450> keep<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.750> sort<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.049> located

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
inwards to keep it sort of located

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.800 
inwards to keep it sort of located
within<00:02:26.040> California<00:02:26.969> Adventure<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.659> keep

within California Adventure and to keep

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.390 
within California Adventure and to keep
it<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.019> little<00:02:28.049> less<00:02:28.409> noisy<00:02:28.859> for<00:02:29.010> people<00:02:29.310> who

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it a little less noisy for people who

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.849 
it a little less noisy for people who
live<00:02:29.609> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> area<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.930> yet<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.379> still<00:02:31.620> sort

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
live in the area and yet it still sort

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.190 
live in the area and yet it still sort
of<00:02:32.010> has<00:02:32.609> a<00:02:32.640> cool<00:02:32.819> look<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.689> fits<00:02:33.989> in<00:02:34.170> with

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
of has a cool look that fits in with

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.360 
of has a cool look that fits in with
this<00:02:34.590> design

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
this design

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.429 
this design
now<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.269> coaster<00:02:36.659> used<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.019> actually

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
now this coaster used to actually

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.770 
now this coaster used to actually
feature<00:02:37.829> two<00:02:38.280> little<00:02:38.579> ears<00:02:38.939> that<00:02:39.180> would<00:02:39.359> go<00:02:39.540> by

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
feature two little ears that would go by

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.690 
feature two little ears that would go by
the<00:02:39.840> inversion<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.650> create<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> Mickey<00:02:41.430> head

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the inversion to create a Mickey head

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.539 
the inversion to create a Mickey head
that<00:02:41.909> was<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.359> cool<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:43.409> in<00:02:43.560> 2008<00:02:44.370> they

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
that was really cool but in 2008 they

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.030 
that was really cool but in 2008 they
removed<00:02:44.939> it<00:02:45.090> because<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.659> had<00:02:45.840> put<00:02:46.109> Mickey's

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
removed it because they had put Mickey's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.280 
removed it because they had put Mickey's
face<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.700> ferris<00:02:48.060> wheel<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.780> now<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.049> sort

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
face on the ferris wheel so now it sort

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.199 
face on the ferris wheel so now it sort
of<00:02:49.319> has<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.650> sort<00:02:49.889> of<00:02:49.980> Sun<00:02:50.340> icon<00:02:50.909> in<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.640 
of has this sort of Sun icon in the
middle<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.689> then<00:02:51.870> perhaps<00:02:52.079> one<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
middle and then perhaps one of the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.379 
middle and then perhaps one of the
latest<00:02:53.010> changes<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.700> attraction<00:02:54.030> in

November of 2010 they took the original
safety<00:02:57.239> spiels

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
safety spiels

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.629 
safety spiels
that<00:02:58.200> they<00:02:58.349> would<00:02:58.500> play<00:02:58.739> before<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.159> took<00:02:59.430> off

you're really of the older Doogie Howser
MD<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:13.189> then<00:03:14.189> the<00:03:14.280> last<00:03:14.489> fact<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:15.030> sort<00:03:15.239> of

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
MD and then the last fact I sort of

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.369 
MD and then the last fact I sort of
wanted<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.629> throw<00:03:15.870> out<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.079> because<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
wanted to throw out there because I

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.509 
wanted to throw out there because I
thought<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.650> really<00:03:16.829> interesting<00:03:17.340> is

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
thought it was really interesting is

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.349 
thought it was really interesting is
that<00:03:17.729> this<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.449> one<00:03:19.079> heavy<00:03:19.560> coaster<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.819> took

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
that this is one heavy coaster it took

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.339 
that this is one heavy coaster it took
almost<00:03:21.739> six<00:03:22.739> million<00:03:23.389> pounds<00:03:24.389> of<00:03:24.419> steel<00:03:25.019> to

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
almost six million pounds of steel to

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.289 
almost six million pounds of steel to
build<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.829> when<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> consider<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.060> one

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
build this when you consider that one

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.119 
build this when you consider that one
it's<00:03:27.479> a<00:03:27.569> steel<00:03:27.810> coaster<00:03:28.319> instead<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.799> wooden

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
it's a steel coaster instead of a wooden

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.670 
it's a steel coaster instead of a wooden
coaster<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.669> two<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.359> again<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.349> fourth

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
but still putting the effort to theme it

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.259 
but still putting the effort to theme it
to<00:04:10.769> look<00:04:10.949> like<00:04:10.979> a<00:04:11.129> wooden<00:04:11.519> coaster<00:04:11.909> so<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.180> it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
to look like a wooden coaster so that it

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.360 
to look like a wooden coaster so that it
would<00:04:12.359> fit<00:04:12.629> in<00:04:12.810> better<00:04:13.079> with<00:04:13.409> that<00:04:13.829> theming<00:04:14.099> of

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
would fit in better with that theming of

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.180
