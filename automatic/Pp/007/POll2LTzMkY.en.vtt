00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
are kind of a darker yellow like a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
are kind of a darker yellow like a
dandelion<00:02:38.930> black<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.380> white<00:02:41.780> maybe<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.870> little

gray<00:02:44.000> see<00:02:45.000> how<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> paint<00:02:45.420> scheme<00:02:45.830> starts<00:02:46.830> out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
gray see how the paint scheme starts out

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.130 
gray see how the paint scheme starts out
with<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.100> really<00:02:47.640> its<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.360> guess<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.900> cool

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
with a really its I guess it's a cool

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.750 
with a really its I guess it's a cool
splitter<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.710> like<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.190> yellow<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
splitter it's like I it's yellow in the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
splitter it's like I it's yellow in the
front<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.270> then<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.960> top<00:02:52.200> part<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.620> black

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
front and then the top part is black

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.380 
front and then the top part is black
that's<00:02:53.550> kind<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.970> weird<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> looks<00:02:55.140> cool

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
that's kind of weird but it looks cool

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.970 
that's kind of weird but it looks cool
then<00:02:57.390> yeah<00:02:57.570> then<00:02:57.600> there<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> black<00:02:58.500> there's<00:02:58.920> a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
then yeah then there the black there's a

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.890 
then yeah then there the black there's a
blackleg<00:02:59.460> where<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> splitter<00:03:00.270> braces<00:03:00.720> are

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
blackleg where the splitter braces are

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.560 
blackleg where the splitter braces are
and<00:03:01.140> then<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:02.310> comes<00:03:02.490> up<00:03:02.790> an<00:03:02.910> eternity<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> do

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and then it comes up an eternity to do

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.750 
and then it comes up an eternity to do
like<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> piston<00:03:04.380> yes<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.610> a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
like a piston yes I think that's a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.910 
like a piston yes I think that's a
piston<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> filter<00:03:06.900> some<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.320> really<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.800> no

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
piston or a filter some I really have no

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.290 
piston or a filter some I really have no
idea<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.350> yellow<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.370> then

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
idea and then it's on yellow and then

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.840 
idea and then it's on yellow and then
the<00:03:12.510> yellow<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:14.220> yellow<00:03:14.250> continues

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the yellow the yellow continues

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.910 
the yellow the yellow continues
throughout<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> hood<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.480> car<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.989> then

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
throughout the hood of the car and then

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.860 
throughout the hood of the car and then
the<00:03:17.100> black<00:03:17.280> from<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.970> side<00:03:18.150> comes<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the black from the side comes up and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.000 
the black from the side comes up and
makes<00:03:19.020> these<00:03:19.200> jagged<00:03:19.530> lines<00:03:20.300> behind<00:03:21.300> all<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
makes these jagged lines behind all the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.900 
makes these jagged lines behind all the
context<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.250> then<00:03:24.950> 39<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.459> yellow

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
context and then 39 is in just yellow

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.699 
context and then 39 is in just yellow
and<00:03:27.180> then<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:28.020> don't<00:03:28.320> know<00:03:28.470> what<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.590> is

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and then I just don't know what that is

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.280 
and then I just don't know what that is
a<00:03:28.860> piston<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.520> really<00:03:29.850> don't<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.420> then

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
a piston I really don't know and then

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.830 
a piston I really don't know and then
that<00:03:32.010> kind<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.430> turns<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.150> car<00:03:33.330> from<00:03:33.600> yellow

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
that kind of turns the car from yellow

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.590 
that kind of turns the car from yellow
to<00:03:33.959> black<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.680> back<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.150> there's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
to black on the back you can see there's

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.710 
to black on the back you can see there's
like<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.470> transition<00:03:39.950> um<00:03:41.090> yeah<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.270> top<00:03:42.510> is

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
like the transition um yeah the top is

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.040 
like the transition um yeah the top is
black<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.170> route<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.680> roof<00:03:44.010> rails<00:03:44.280> are<00:03:44.550> or<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
black the route the roof rails are or a

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.460 
black the route the roof rails are or a
yellow<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.380> roof<00:03:46.620> rails<00:03:46.860> are<00:03:47.100> yellow<00:03:47.820> as<00:03:48.000> well

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.520 
and everyone said like nationwide cars
but<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.520> don't<00:05:26.790> collect<00:05:27.270> nationwide<00:05:27.900> cars<00:05:28.169> like

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.140 
I think the only non nationwide car said
was<00:05:32.220> Regan<00:05:32.580> Smith<00:05:32.850> 78<00:05:33.690> car<00:05:34.700> so<00:05:35.700> I<00:05:35.729> decided<00:05:36.090> to
