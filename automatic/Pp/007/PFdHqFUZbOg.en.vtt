00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.350
 there are boys and guys we do not see each other 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.839
 time in another one of my horror videos like 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.260
 just go up although they are not always going to be 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.170
 A) Yes 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.390
 I plan to upload other things what happens 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.980
 is that right now he has given me for these 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.520
 I hope you enjoy it just like me 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.610
 and as always 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.360
 I usually say that I do not know what to do 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.980
 this kind of games simply the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.980
 games if I find something right 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.890
 no story that they are fun better 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.160
 still some exciting fun 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.440
 because here are scares and so on 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.480
 but right now I'm visiting the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.930
 room and not 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 I do not see anyone passing 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 I can not do not 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.460
 how not my character was breathing 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.460
 deep 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.700
 God 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.700
 it would cross 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 I know you know I told you 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.860
 screwed to the wall and not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.860
 good 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.530
 I'm hearing strange things 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.850
 to nothing 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.360
 that around here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.070
 and 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.070
 what happens 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.100
 I'm nervous, very nervous 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.100
 I think you have to do uncle 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.610
 thing 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.550
 it becomes greater for a second the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.800
 game 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.310
 and Canada seriously what it is 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.310
 do not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.209
 we will continue visiting the rooms 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.940
 visiting 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.870
 or 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.870
 a corpse 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.740
 and this is what 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.140
 what what happens 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.940
 a head but if it has a head 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.540
 where the other one comes 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.540
 fuck 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.690
 with some blood stains 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.170
 what's happening here 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.170
 the thing here 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.970
 what's up an ax I can take it 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.830
 they are blood rhymes 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.020
 today there is still a lot of corridor 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.020
 in front of 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.480
 good good good I do not know how you are 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.480
 watching you this game 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.350
 God, I am a scream 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.570
 not only are you watching me 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.950
 I think the simple one does not put you 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.000
 rooms are going through the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:47.210
 rooms and as you go through 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.600
 We are finding things not 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.820
 but normal 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.650
 I have to find a key like these 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.750
 games always bring the themes of 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.750
 I found a key and I'm hearing 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.380
 or something 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.380
 someone is alive 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.200
 what I am 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.780

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.780

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.140

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.050
 I always get out of these weird 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.680
 with credit 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.520

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.009

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.900
