a<00:01:12.360> knot<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:13.290> calling<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.610> knotted

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
a knot we're calling this the knotted

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
a knot we're calling this the knotted
braid<00:01:15.210> pull<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.549> using

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
braid pull it down because you're using

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.160 
braid pull it down because you're using
a<00:01:18.090> series<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.509> knots<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.619> create<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> braid<00:01:21.170> okay

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a series of knots to create a braid okay

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.679 
a series of knots to create a braid okay
so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:22.920> pieces<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:24.060> three<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.659> a

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:03.230 
put hair on the right side you're going
to<00:04:54.850> continue<00:04:55.300> this<00:04:55.479> all<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.780> way<00:04:55.990> down

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.089 

now<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.900> can<00:05:04.080> see<00:05:04.259> how<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.740> little<00:05:04.889> bit

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
now you can see how this is a little bit

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.920 
now you can see how this is a little bit
loose<00:05:05.280> right<00:05:05.490> there<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.240> if<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.419> just<00:05:06.599> hang<00:05:06.780> on

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
loose right there so if you just hang on

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.390 
loose right there so if you just hang on
to<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:07.199> hair<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.590> can<00:05:07.770> slide<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.190> braid

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
to this hair you can slide the braid

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:20.650 
to this hair you can slide the braid
down<00:05:08.580> tighter<00:05:08.880> onto<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.360> head<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.840> side

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.820 

you're<00:05:21.290> through<00:05:21.620> flip<00:05:22.610> it<00:05:23.470> pull<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.590> through

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.870 

can<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:27.920> tip<00:05:28.100> your<00:05:28.220> head<00:05:28.280> down<00:05:28.460> just<00:05:28.760> a<00:05:28.850> little

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
can you tip your head down just a little

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.470 
can you tip your head down just a little
bit<00:05:29.120> count<00:05:29.690> that<00:05:29.900> way<00:05:30.050> this<00:05:30.200> time<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
bit count that way this time to the

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.810 
bit count that way this time to the
right

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.960 

through<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.930> think<00:05:40.650> it's<00:05:40.800> tricky<00:05:41.190> only<00:05:41.640> because

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
through I think it's tricky only because

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.880 
through I think it's tricky only because
it's<00:05:42.180> kind<00:05:42.660> of<00:05:42.720> different<00:05:42.990> fingering<00:05:43.650> and

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
it's kind of different fingering and

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.100 
it's kind of different fingering and
your<00:05:44.250> hairs<00:05:44.490> your<00:05:45.030> fingers<00:05:45.510> aren't<00:05:45.750> used<00:05:45.990> to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
your hairs your fingers aren't used to

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.900 
your hairs your fingers aren't used to
so<00:05:47.100> once<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:48.030> learn<00:05:48.240> it<00:05:48.510> it's<00:05:48.920> easy<00:05:49.920> but<00:05:50.760> it

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
so once you learn it it's easy but it

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.080 
so once you learn it it's easy but it
takes<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:51.240> little<00:05:51.450> while<00:05:51.570> okay

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
takes a little while okay

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.590 
takes a little while okay
this<00:05:54.090> will<00:05:54.210> be<00:05:54.330> our<00:05:54.450> last<00:05:54.690> piece<00:05:54.990> on<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.290> left

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
this will be our last piece on the left

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.530
