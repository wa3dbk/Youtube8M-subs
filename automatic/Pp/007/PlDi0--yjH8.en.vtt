00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
opinion so just start off um magic is a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.960 
opinion so just start off um magic is a
card<00:01:23.100> game<00:01:23.280> from<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.390> I've<00:01:24.509> gathered<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this is its translation into a constant

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.460 
this is its translation into a constant
so<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:30.509> fairly<00:01:30.780> interesting<00:01:31.380> i

it wasn't it wasn't that difficult one
of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> biggest<00:01:57.450> problems<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.500> actually

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
of the biggest problems that I actually

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.740 
of the biggest problems that I actually
do<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.030> game<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:02.299> lot<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.479> times

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
do have with this game is a lot of times

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.190 
do have with this game is a lot of times
to<00:02:04.290> continue<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.130> actual<00:02:05.729> game<00:02:06.119> menu<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
to continue in your actual game menu you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
to continue in your actual game menu you
have<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.530> hit<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> y<00:02:07.950> button<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:09.239> for<00:02:09.479> me

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
have to hit the y button which for me

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.369 
have to hit the y button which for me
that's<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.890> bit<00:02:11.190> odd<00:02:12.379> typically

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
that's just a little bit odd typically

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.150 
that's just a little bit odd typically
the<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> button

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the a button

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.910 
the a button
is<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.490> continue<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.500> action

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
is to continue or you know your action

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.310 
is to continue or you know your action
button<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:18.060> seemed<00:02:18.270> very<00:02:18.600> strange<00:02:18.810> to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
button so it just seemed very strange to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.290 
button so it just seemed very strange to
have<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.920> hit<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> y<00:02:20.280> button<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.940> button

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
have to hit the y button and a button

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.170 
have to hit the y button and a button
back<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.690> forth<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:23.070> kind<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.880> didn't

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
back and forth and it kind of didn't

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
back and forth and it kind of didn't
make<00:02:24.450> sense<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.990> me<00:02:25.140> when<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> came<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
make sense to me when it came to the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.240 
make sense to me when it came to the
overall<00:02:26.610> button<00:02:26.970> layout<00:02:27.180> um<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:28.650> speaking<00:02:28.830> of

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
overall button layout um but speaking of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.770 
overall button layout um but speaking of
the<00:02:29.370> button<00:02:29.610> layout<00:02:29.910> i<00:02:29.940> think<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:30.630> did

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the button layout i think that they did

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.450 
the button layout i think that they did
a<00:02:30.810> great<00:02:31.230> job<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> button<00:02:32.010> layout<00:02:32.220> with

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
a great job with the button layout with

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.150 
a great job with the button layout with
with<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.180> zoom<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:35.070> know

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
with the zoom in then you can you know

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.640 
with the zoom in then you can you know
hit<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:35.970> what<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.660> right<00:02:36.870> bumper<00:02:37.110> for

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
hit the what is the right bumper for

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100 
hit the what is the right bumper for
more<00:02:37.950> information<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:38.670> they<00:02:39.240> did<00:02:39.540> actually<00:02:39.780> do

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
more information so they did actually do

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.640 
more information so they did actually do
a<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.380> good<00:02:40.560> job<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:41.030> figuring<00:02:42.030> out<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
a really good job of figuring out the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.120 
a really good job of figuring out the
overall<00:02:43.980> button<00:02:44.520> scheme<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:46.130> controller

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
overall button scheme of the controller

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.540 
overall button scheme of the controller
to<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> card<00:02:48.510> game<00:02:48.750> basically<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.310> i<00:02:50.340> thought

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
to a card game basically so i thought

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.180 
to a card game basically so i thought
that<00:02:50.700> was<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:51.030> nice<00:02:52.190> definitely

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that was really nice definitely

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.220 
that was really nice definitely
something<00:02:53.520> i<00:02:53.610> didn't<00:02:54.230> quite<00:02:55.230> expect<00:02:55.550> from<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
something i didn't quite expect from a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.380 
something i didn't quite expect from a
game<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:59.130> card<00:02:59.820> game<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.270> there's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
game that is a card game and there's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.450 
game that is a card game and there's
really<00:03:01.230> no<00:03:01.560> technical<00:03:02.220> aspect<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.770> button

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
really no technical aspect to the button

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.550 
really no technical aspect to the button
work<00:03:05.700> i<00:03:05.910> guess<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.270> could<00:03:06.390> say<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.840> when<00:03:07.470> you

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
work i guess you could say of when you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.690 
work i guess you could say of when you
play<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:09.320> from<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.100> just<00:03:11.310> all<00:03:11.490> from

my<00:03:11.790> understanding<00:03:11.910> i'm<00:03:12.690> still<00:03:13.350> kind<00:03:13.740> of

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
my understanding i'm still kind of

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.700 
my understanding i'm still kind of
clueless<00:03:13.980> all<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.610> but<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.810> turn<00:03:16.050> based<00:03:16.080> i

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
clueless all this but it's turn based i

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.160 
clueless all this but it's turn based i
know<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.550> can<00:03:18.120> begin<00:03:18.300> by<00:03:18.570> playing<00:03:18.840> mana

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
know that you can begin by playing mana

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.190 
know that you can begin by playing mana
or<00:03:19.580> land<00:03:20.580> cards<00:03:21.060> or<00:03:21.240> whatever<00:03:21.720> they're

or land cards or whatever they're

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.949 
or land cards or whatever they're
considered<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.330> attack<00:03:24.690> with

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
considered and then you can attack with

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.080 
considered and then you can attack with
creatures<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.830> attack<00:03:26.190> their<00:03:26.430> life<00:03:26.670> points

creatures to attack their life points
and<00:03:27.300> eventually<00:03:27.930> win<00:03:28.490> now<00:03:29.490> this<00:03:29.670> first<00:03:29.850> one

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
and eventually win now this first one

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.210 
and eventually win now this first one
you<00:03:30.330> do<00:03:30.480> win<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.620> pretty<00:03:31.800> much<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.010> given

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
you do win it's pretty much a given

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.060 
you do win it's pretty much a given
because<00:03:32.520> they<00:03:32.730> tell<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.000> exactly<00:03:33.330> what<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.540> do

because they tell you exactly what to do

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.020 
because they tell you exactly what to do
that's<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.280> only<00:03:35.459> way<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.700> i<00:03:35.730> learned<00:03:35.940> how

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
that's the only way that i learned how

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.880 
that's the only way that i learned how
to<00:03:36.090> play<00:03:36.180> if<00:03:36.630> i<00:03:36.840> had<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.290> jumped<00:03:37.530> into<00:03:37.770> the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
to play if i had just jumped into the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.260 
to play if i had just jumped into the
game<00:03:38.040> i<00:03:38.190> probably<00:03:38.310> went<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.730> about<00:03:38.940> quite

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
game i probably went to about quite

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.470 
game i probably went to about quite
understood<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:39.990> well<00:03:41.240> aside<00:03:42.240> from<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
understood it as well aside from the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.229 
understood it as well aside from the
fact<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.780> i<00:03:42.900> think<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.520> because<00:03:44.520> I've<00:03:44.820> said

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
fact that i think that because I've said

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.880 
fact that i think that because I've said
it<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.690> I've<00:03:45.810> never<00:03:46.020> played<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.620> would

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
it to that I've never played it would

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.949 
it to that I've never played it would
still<00:03:47.130> give<00:03:47.280> me<00:03:47.400> hints<00:03:47.730> even<00:03:48.660> while<00:03:48.840> I'm

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
still give me hints even while I'm

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.750 
still give me hints even while I'm
playing<00:03:49.200> um<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.810> looks<00:03:52.200> as<00:03:52.470> though<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
playing um but it looks as though the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.949 
playing um but it looks as though the
campaign<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.480> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.560> be<00:03:55.739> fairly<00:03:56.220> short<00:03:56.959> um

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
campaign is going to be fairly short um

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.890 
campaign is going to be fairly short um
now<00:03:58.890> I'm<00:03:59.220> not<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> hundred<00:03:59.640> percent<00:03:59.850> as<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.660> how

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
now I'm not a hundred percent as to how

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.360 
now I'm not a hundred percent as to how
long<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.170> entire<00:04:01.560> campaign<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.100> going<00:04:02.250> to

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
long the entire campaign is going to

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.850 
long the entire campaign is going to
take<00:04:02.520> because<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.450> can<00:04:03.900> only<00:04:04.020> see<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.620> first

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
take because I can only see the first

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.979 
take because I can only see the first
portion<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.520> but<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.270> first<00:04:06.420> portion<00:04:06.690> you

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
portion of it but the first portion you

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.620 
portion of it but the first portion you
only<00:04:07.170> battle<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:07.830> people<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.209> after

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
only battle for people and then after

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.660 
only battle for people and then after
that<00:04:09.780> there<00:04:10.140> are<00:04:10.380> one<00:04:10.739> two<00:04:10.770> three<00:04:11.370> four<00:04:11.640> five

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that there are one two three four five

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.880 
that there are one two three four five
different<00:04:12.570> locations<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.440> need<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.770> go

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
different locations that you need to go

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.890 
different locations that you need to go
to<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.489> also<00:04:14.610> fight<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.360> I'm<00:04:15.510> not<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.690> hundred

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
to and also fight so I'm not a hundred

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.050 
to and also fight so I'm not a hundred
percent<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.799> whether<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.790> going<00:04:17.970> to

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
percent as to whether it's it's going to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.670 
percent as to whether it's it's going to
be<00:04:18.180> four<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.570> each<00:04:18.660> one<00:04:18.930> whether<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.530> going

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
be four in each one whether it's going

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.900 
be four in each one whether it's going
to<00:04:19.739> become<00:04:19.859> more<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.370> more<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.700> more<00:04:20.760> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
to become more and more and more and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.779 
to become more and more and more and
more<00:04:21.590> or<00:04:22.590> anything<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.250> but<00:04:23.610> there's

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
more or anything like that but there's

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.200 
more or anything like that but there's
also<00:04:23.970> challenges<00:04:24.630> there's<00:04:25.640> what

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
also challenges there's what

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.969 
also challenges there's what
called<00:04:27.360> revenge<00:04:27.690> I'm<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.229> exactly<00:04:28.470> sure<00:04:28.650> what

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
called revenge I'm not exactly sure what

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.140 
called revenge I'm not exactly sure what
that<00:04:29.009> is<00:04:29.190> but<00:04:30.380> there<00:04:31.380> seems<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.280> lot<00:04:32.759> to

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
that is but there seems to be a lot to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.930 
that is but there seems to be a lot to
do<00:04:33.330> in<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:34.229> game<00:04:34.319> so<00:04:35.160> it's<00:04:35.400> not<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.580> going

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
do in this game so it's not just going

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.689 
do in this game so it's not just going
to<00:04:36.000> be<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.210> hop<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.110> play<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.400> finish

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
to be a hop in and play and you finish

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.909 
to be a hop in and play and you finish
in<00:04:38.910> an<00:04:39.060> hour<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:40.229> seems<00:04:40.530> like<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:40.860> is

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
in an hour it seems like this is

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.189 
in an hour it seems like this is
actually<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.669> game<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.150> could<00:04:42.690> take<00:04:42.810> up<00:04:42.990> quite

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
actually a game that could take up quite

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.499 
actually a game that could take up quite
a<00:04:43.229> bit<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.470> time<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:43.889> know<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:44.220> magic<00:04:45.120> itself

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
a bit of time I know that magic itself

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.680 
a bit of time I know that magic itself
the<00:04:46.380> card<00:04:46.620> game<00:04:46.789> can<00:04:47.789> take<00:04:48.060> up<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.270> lot<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.449> time

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
the card game can take up a lot of time

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.230 
the card game can take up a lot of time
especially<00:04:48.870> if<00:04:49.229> you're<00:04:49.940> doing<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.090> guess

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
especially if you're doing I guess

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.029 
especially if you're doing I guess
tournaments<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:51.990> stuff<00:04:52.050> like<00:04:52.289> that<00:04:52.349> and

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
tournaments and stuff like that and

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.249 
tournaments and stuff like that and
battling<00:04:53.880> people<00:04:54.300> but<00:04:55.699> all<00:04:56.699> in<00:04:57.150> all<00:04:57.270> for<00:04:57.599> it

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
battling people but all in all for it

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.640 
battling people but all in all for it
being<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.740> game<00:04:58.979> type<00:04:59.699> that<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.090> wouldn't

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
being a game type that I wouldn't

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.450 
being a game type that I wouldn't
primarily<00:05:01.650> or<00:05:02.099> traditionally<00:05:02.820> play<00:05:03.349> I<00:05:04.460> would

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
primarily or traditionally play I would

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.890 
primarily or traditionally play I would
definitely<00:05:05.669> recommend<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.509> all<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.810> you
