generator<00:01:39.180> needed<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.710> wonderful<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
generator needed it's wonderful and a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.260 
generator needed it's wonderful and a
lot<00:01:41.670> better<00:01:41.940> for<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.300> environment

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270

I like is it brings the microwave up
high<00:04:08.060> instead<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.660> having<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.959> down<00:04:09.139> low<00:04:09.410> so

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
high instead of having it down low so

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.979 
high instead of having it down low so
it's<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.400> at<00:04:10.519> eye<00:04:10.549> level<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:11.959> a

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
it's right at eye level this is a

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.809 
it's right at eye level this is a
convection<00:04:12.380> microwave<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.130> it'll<00:04:13.340> bake<00:04:13.519> just

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
convection microwave so it'll bake just

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.599 
convection microwave so it'll bake just
like<00:04:13.940> an<00:04:14.060> oven<00:04:14.180> which<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:14.959> really<00:04:15.200> nice<00:04:15.609> of

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
like an oven which is really nice of

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
the floor here table goes in and then of

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.920 
the floor here table goes in and then of
course<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:25.130> chairs<00:04:25.580> up<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:25.970> front<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.510> do

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
course the chairs up in the front I do

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.250 
course the chairs up in the front I do
turn<00:04:27.350> around<00:04:28.180> part<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.300> e-track<00:04:29.720> package

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
turn around part of the e-track package

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.460 
turn around part of the e-track package
is<00:04:30.560> this<00:04:31.010> unit<00:04:31.430> does<00:04:31.550> not<00:04:31.580> have<00:04:32.200> propane<00:04:33.200> on<00:04:33.229> it

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
is this unit does not have propane on it

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.190 
is this unit does not have propane on it
so<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.280> uses<00:04:34.550> all<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.479> an<00:04:35.630> all-electric

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
so it uses all it's an all-electric

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.770 
so it uses all it's an all-electric
coach<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.340> use<00:04:37.520> an<00:04:37.669> induction<00:04:38.000> cooktop<00:04:38.360> on

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
coach and so use an induction cooktop on

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.670 
coach and so use an induction cooktop on
this<00:04:38.960> unit<00:04:40.539> even<00:04:41.539> the<00:04:41.750> countertop<00:04:42.229> in<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.530> is
