the<00:00:13.070> hardest<00:00:13.369> part<00:00:13.549> about<00:00:13.610> this<00:00:13.910> song<00:00:14.089> is

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
the hardest part about this song is

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.029 
the hardest part about this song is
really<00:00:14.360> just<00:00:14.690> remembering<00:00:15.409> when<00:00:15.679> the<00:00:15.829> band's

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
really just remembering when the band's

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.740 
really just remembering when the band's
coming<00:00:16.400> in<00:00:16.519> when<00:00:16.849> the<00:00:16.970> band's<00:00:17.150> going<00:00:17.480> out

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
coming in when the band's going out

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.450 
coming in when the band's going out
there<00:00:18.349> really<00:00:18.470> wasn't<00:00:18.740> much<00:00:18.920> going<00:00:19.220> on<00:00:19.310> with

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
there really wasn't much going on with

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.009 
there really wasn't much going on with
the<00:00:19.580> lead<00:00:19.759> guitar<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:20.420> we<00:00:20.509> converted<00:00:20.869> the

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
the lead guitar so we converted the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.480 
the lead guitar so we converted the
fiddle<00:00:21.289> riff<00:00:21.470> into<00:00:21.859> a<00:00:21.890> pretty<00:00:22.160> nice<00:00:22.340> little

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
fiddle riff into a pretty nice little

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:38.860 
fiddle riff into a pretty nice little
country<00:00:22.910> guitar<00:00:23.029> part

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.940 

some<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> south

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
sweet-potato pie and I shut my mouth

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.990 
sweet-potato pie and I shut my mouth
gone<00:00:44.750> gone<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> wind<00:00:46.379> ain't<00:00:47.220> nobody

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
so there's really only two strum

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.820 
so there's really only two strum
patterns<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.960> chord<00:01:51.140> progressions<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.710> we

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
patterns and chord progressions that we

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.930 
patterns and chord progressions that we
need<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.070> learn<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.370> get<00:01:52.460> through<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:52.760> whole

authentic<00:02:23.270> feel<00:02:24.020> there<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.530> some<00:02:24.680> subtle

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
authentic feel there are some subtle

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.380 
authentic feel there are some subtle
things<00:02:25.220> we<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:25.730> our<00:02:25.820> pick<00:02:26.060> as<00:02:26.209> we're

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
things we can do with our pick as we're

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.240 
things we can do with our pick as we're
doing<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.720> strum<00:02:26.989> pattern<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.830> first<00:02:27.860> down

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
doing this strum pattern the first down

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.250 
doing this strum pattern the first down
stroke<00:02:28.520> will<00:02:28.640> be<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> low<00:02:29.090> strings<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
stroke will be on the low strings the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.820 
stroke will be on the low strings the
next<00:02:30.530> one<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.890> high<00:02:31.220> strings

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
next one on the high strings

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.490 
next one on the high strings
and<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.780> next<00:02:34.900> amount<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.320> will

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and then the next amount for that will

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.070 
and then the next amount for that will
be<00:02:35.620> low<00:02:35.770> now<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.090> then<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.360> next<00:02:37.390> up<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.960> down

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
be low now and then the next up and down

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.920 
be low now and then the next up and down
will<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.740> high<00:02:38.890> up

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
will be on the high up

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.500 
will be on the high up
so<00:02:41.500> let's<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.739> just<00:02:41.769> that<00:02:42.099> G<00:02:42.310> chord<00:02:42.579> again<00:02:42.819> down

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so let's do just that G chord again down

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.580 
so let's do just that G chord again down
down<00:02:44.439> down<00:02:45.310> up<00:02:45.579> down<00:02:46.200> let's<00:02:47.200> do<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.439> same

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
down down up down let's do the same

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.530 
down down up down let's do the same

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.910 
covering how to play that fiddle riff on
the<00:03:25.060> lead<00:03:25.330> guitar<00:03:25.360> that's<00:03:26.260> by<00:03:26.410> far<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.770> most

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
the lead guitar that's by far the most

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.740 
the lead guitar that's by far the most
fun<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.400> can<00:03:27.550> have<00:03:27.730> with<00:03:28.240> this<00:03:28.390> song<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
fun that we can have with this song the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.330 
fun that we can have with this song the
rest<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.050> it's<00:03:29.170> very<00:03:29.470> straightforward<00:03:29.860> but

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
rest of it's very straightforward but

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.980 
rest of it's very straightforward but
we'll<00:03:30.490> go<00:03:30.580> over<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.910> too<00:03:31.120> at<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.600> end<00:03:31.750> and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
we'll go over that too at the end and

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.510 
we'll go over that too at the end and
then<00:03:32.080> we'll<00:03:32.140> play<00:03:32.380> everything<00:03:32.890> at<00:03:33.010> full<00:03:33.160> tempo

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
then we'll play everything at full tempo

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.370 
then we'll play everything at full tempo
with<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.760> metronome<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.900> here's<00:03:35.140> how<00:03:35.320> that

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
with the metronome so here's how that

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:47.730 
with the metronome so here's how that
fiddle<00:03:36.040> riff<00:03:36.190> looks

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.020 

that's<00:03:48.740> the<00:03:48.860> first<00:03:49.100> half<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.610> we<00:03:49.640> get<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:49.940> the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
that's the first half and we get to the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:04:02.050 
that's the first half and we get to the
second<00:03:50.390> half

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.330 

all<00:04:02.599> right<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.980> sixth

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
all right so this is in the sixth

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:14.080 
all right so this is in the sixth
position<00:04:04.480> diatonic<00:04:05.480> in<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.660> key<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:13.090> song

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
position diatonic in the key of a song

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.180 
position diatonic in the key of a song
is<00:04:14.239> just<00:04:14.270> playing<00:04:14.630> chords<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:15.349> during<00:04:16.100> the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
is just playing chords so during the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.190 
is just playing chords so during the
courses<00:04:16.730> we're<00:04:17.389> just<00:04:17.570> kind<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.780> getting<00:04:18.019> our

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
courses we're just kind of getting our
