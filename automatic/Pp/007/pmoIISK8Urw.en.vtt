hello YouTube mobile technology reviews
here<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:14.300> it's<00:00:14.540> been<00:00:14.690> five<00:00:15.080> months<00:00:15.380> since<00:00:15.710> i

silicon it holds II this flap onto this
thing<00:01:21.490> right<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:22.840> has<00:01:23.840> ripped<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:25.250> cover

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
thing right here has ripped the cover

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.380 
thing right here has ripped the cover
still<00:01:25.820> stays<00:01:26.060> on<00:01:26.300> there<00:01:27.250> but<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.940> can't<00:01:29.180> just

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
still stays on there but you can't just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.410 
still stays on there but you can't just
go<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:30.110> flip<00:01:30.410> out<00:01:30.650> anymore<00:01:32.440> and

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
go like that and flip out anymore and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.510 
go like that and flip out anymore and
finally<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:36.020> outer<00:01:36.530> garment<00:01:37.900> layer<00:01:39.520> now

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
finally the outer garment layer now

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.910 
finally the outer garment layer now
watch<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.820> happen<00:01:40.970> date<00:01:41.270> either<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
watch this happen date either the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.800 
watch this happen date either the
protective<00:01:43.820> screen<00:01:43.850> protector<00:01:44.360> has<00:01:44.480> gotten

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
protective screen protector has gotten

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.440 
protective screen protector has gotten
quite<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.260> few<00:01:45.320> more<00:01:45.560> scratches<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.340> there<00:01:47.330> are

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
quite a few more scratches and there are

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.040 
quite a few more scratches and there are
a<00:01:47.480> few<00:01:47.690> scuffs<00:01:48.520> right<00:01:49.520> around<00:01:49.700> here<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.780> along

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
a few scuffs right around here and along

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.649 
a few scuffs right around here and along
this<00:01:51.230> edge<00:01:51.550> because<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.670> have<00:01:52.850> dropped<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.420> a

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
this edge because I have dropped this a

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.280 
this edge because I have dropped this a
few<00:01:54.350> times<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.540> I'll<00:01:56.690> add<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.840> right<00:01:56.990> on<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
few times and I'll add it right on the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.310 
few times and I'll add it right on the
front<00:01:57.470> landed<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.120> this<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.330> scratched<00:01:59.600> it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.450 

um<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:04.479> noticed<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:04.990> if<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.860> put<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.130> ipod

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
um I've noticed that if you put the ipod

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.590 
um I've noticed that if you put the ipod
in<00:02:06.610> here<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.880> leave<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.120> in<00:02:07.240> there<00:02:07.330> for<00:02:07.390> a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
in here and leave it in there for a

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.529 
in here and leave it in there for a
while<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.920> be<00:02:09.280> back<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:10.179> starts<00:02:10.479> to

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
while then be back this starts to

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.449 
while then be back this starts to
scratch<00:02:10.840> up<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.050> back<00:02:11.320> like<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.010> part<00:02:12.400> right

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
scratch up the back like this part right

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.699 
scratch up the back like this part right
here<00:02:12.610> around<00:02:13.120> here<00:02:13.480> starts<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.410> scratch<00:02:14.680> up

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
here around here starts to scratch up

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.220 
here around here starts to scratch up
the<00:02:14.890> back<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.340> ipod<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.050> put<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the back of the ipod so I it is I put a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.830 
the back of the ipod so I it is I put a
thin<00:02:17.560> layer<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.800> fabric<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.580> here<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.660> make

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
thin layer of fabric in here to make

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.890 
thin layer of fabric in here to make
sure<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:21.060> cut<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> out<00:02:22.270> right<00:02:22.450> here<00:02:22.630> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
sure that I cut it out right here and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.600 
sure that I cut it out right here and
around<00:02:23.230> here<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:24.160> still<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.520> access

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
around here so I can still have access

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.240 
around here so I can still have access
to<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.940> buttons<00:02:25.770> anyway<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.890> was<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.100> make

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
to the buttons anyway it was to make

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.320 
to the buttons anyway it was to make
sure<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.370> back<00:02:30.670> didn't<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.060> scratched

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
sure that the back didn't get scratched

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.140 
sure that the back didn't get scratched
up<00:02:31.450> anymore<00:02:34.320> okay<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.380> after<00:02:35.890> five<00:02:36.459> months<00:02:36.730> on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
up anymore okay so after five months on

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.340 
up anymore okay so after five months on
this<00:02:37.690> case<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.110> still<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.739> really<00:02:39.730> good<00:02:39.940> case
