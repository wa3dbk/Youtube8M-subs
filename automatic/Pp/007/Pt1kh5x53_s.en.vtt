shippuden episode 223 let me start off
by<00:00:09.090> saying<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.170> filler<00:00:10.620> episode

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
by saying that this is a filler episode

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.650 
by saying that this is a filler episode
so<00:00:11.309> if<00:00:11.400> you're<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> fan<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.000> filler

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660

so if you're not a fan of filler
you<00:00:12.840> don't<00:00:12.990> watch<00:00:13.170> whether<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.679> skip<00:00:13.980> filler

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
yeah like this big red one looked like I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.680 
yeah like this big red one looked like I
guess<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:07.459> don't<00:02:08.459> even<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.789> his<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
guess I don't even know his I was just

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.440 
guess I don't even know his I was just
really<00:02:09.840> red<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.440> once<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.760> also<00:02:12.000> pulled<00:02:12.300> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
really red and once not also pulled that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
really red and once not also pulled that
out<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> fish's<00:02:12.989> head

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
out of the fish's head

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
out of the fish's head
his<00:02:13.890> eyes<00:02:14.099> turned<00:02:14.129> back<00:02:14.609> to<00:02:14.760> normal<00:02:15.060> color<00:02:15.269> and

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
his eyes turned back to normal color and

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.780 
his eyes turned back to normal color and
I<00:02:15.840> guess<00:02:16.019> he<00:02:16.230> puffed<00:02:16.739> away<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.549> where<00:02:17.700> he

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I guess he puffed away back to where he

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.970 
I guess he puffed away back to where he
came<00:02:17.819> from<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:19.079> wraps<00:02:19.319> up<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.650> little

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
came from and that wraps up this little

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
came from and that wraps up this little
mini<00:02:20.159> filler<00:02:20.489> episode<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
mini filler episode so it's not going to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.319 
mini filler episode so it's not going to
be<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> this<00:02:22.769> one<00:02:23.219> episode<00:02:23.640> isn't<00:02:23.909> going<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.239> be

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
be a this one episode isn't going to be

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.030 
be a this one episode isn't going to be
a<00:02:24.359> continuation<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> same<00:02:25.439> story<00:02:25.799> for<00:02:25.859> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
a continuation of the same story for the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.949 
a continuation of the same story for the
next<00:02:26.189> few<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:26.909> just<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.269> one-off<00:02:27.540> filler

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
next few this is just a one-off filler

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.979 
next few this is just a one-off filler
which<00:02:28.469> the<00:02:28.799> next<00:02:29.069> few<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.549> as<00:02:29.670> well

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
which the next few will be as well

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.569 
which the next few will be as well
overall<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.139> thought<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.469> was<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> decent

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
overall I thought it was a decent

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.300 
overall I thought it was a decent
episode<00:02:32.849> ISM<00:02:33.599> wasn't<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.379> like<00:02:34.560> anything
