00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
part 3 I guess it's been a long time

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.009 
part 3 I guess it's been a long time
since<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.290> pushed<00:00:07.620> two<00:00:07.890> trophies<00:00:08.510> I<00:00:09.510> don't

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
since I pushed two trophies I don't

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.930 
since I pushed two trophies I don't
really<00:00:10.170> have<00:00:10.290> any<00:00:10.620> particular<00:00:10.889> reason<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
really have any particular reason as to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.480 
really have any particular reason as to
why<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.540> pushing<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.040> farming

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
why I'm pushing I was just farming

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.779 
why I'm pushing I was just farming
master<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.690> usual<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.560> then<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.460> got

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
master to like usual and then I just got

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.300 
master to like usual and then I just got
on<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.510> high<00:00:18.720> win<00:00:19.020> streak<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
on this really high win streak and so

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
on this really high win streak and so
instead<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.760> intentionally<00:00:21.689> losing<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
instead of intentionally losing and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
instead of intentionally losing and
dropping<00:00:22.890> trophies<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.000> normally<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.600> I

I'm at a personal best as far as trophy
is<00:00:39.059> concerned<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> guess<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.280> resuming<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
is concerned so I guess I'm resuming the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
is concerned so I guess I'm resuming the
champions<00:00:42.480> push<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.230> seven

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
champions push so I'm about seven

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.619 
champions push so I'm about seven
trophies<00:00:46.829> away<00:00:47.370> from<00:00:47.610> master<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.480> now

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
trophies away from master one right now

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.360 
trophies away from master one right now
just<00:00:49.050> waiting<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.710> Archer<00:00:49.950> Queen<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
just waiting for my Archer Queen to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.130 
just waiting for my Archer Queen to
recover<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> thought<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
recover so I thought just make this

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
recover so I thought just make this
quick<00:00:52.440> video<00:00:53.120> basically<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
quick video basically I just want to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.740 
quick video basically I just want to
show<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:55.140> replays<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
show you these replays and then do a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
show you these replays and then do a
live<00:00:57.750> replay<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.859> end<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.449> hopefully<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
live replay at the end and hopefully I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
live replay at the end and hopefully I
don't<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.620> embarrass<00:01:02.280> myself<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
don't up embarrass myself and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
don't up embarrass myself and
hopefully<00:01:03.660> I'll<00:01:04.080> actually<00:01:04.290> find<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> match

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
hopefully I'll actually find a match

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
hopefully I'll actually find a match
that<00:01:05.400> gives<00:01:05.760> me<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.210> than<00:01:06.420> seven<00:01:06.900> trophies

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that gives me more than seven trophies

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.820 
that gives me more than seven trophies
and<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.340> put<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.790> master<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.830> so

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and that will put me into master one so

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
and that will put me into master one so
that's<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> plan<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.610> guy<00:01:15.259> well<00:01:16.259> his

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that's the plan so this guy well his

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130 
that's the plan so this guy well his
defense<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.159> very<00:01:17.520> good<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.900> why<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
defense is very good so that's why I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
defense is very good so that's why I
chose<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.650> attack<00:01:19.860> him<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.369> didn't<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.210> my

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
chose to attack him I didn't have my

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.719 
chose to attack him I didn't have my
clan<00:01:21.659> castle<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.409> I'm<00:01:22.740> upgrading<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.430> barb

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
clan castle and I'm upgrading my barb

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
clan castle and I'm upgrading my barb
King<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.140> didn't<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> use

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
King now so I didn't actually get to use

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
King now so I didn't actually get to use
them<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:26.939> during<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.390> push<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
them at all during this push so if you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
them at all during this push so if you
just<00:01:29.430> take<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> look<00:01:30.060> at<00:01:30.210> those<00:01:30.390> little

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
just take a look at those little

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
just take a look at those little
skeleton<00:01:31.380> things<00:01:31.619> they're<00:01:32.579> actually<00:01:33.119> very

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
skeleton things they're actually very

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.530 
skeleton things they're actually very
annoying<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:35.180> sometimes<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.360> you're

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
annoying because sometimes when you're

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
annoying because sometimes when you're
picking<00:01:36.780> off<00:01:37.020> buildings<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> bathing<00:01:38.070> for

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
picking off buildings and bathing for

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
picking off buildings and bathing for
jag<00:01:38.640> bombs<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.479> spawn<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.200> they'll

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
jag bombs they will spawn and they'll

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.179 
jag bombs they will spawn and they'll
chase<00:01:40.680> your<00:01:40.950> archers<00:01:41.790> around<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> map<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
chase your archers around the map and

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
chase your archers around the map and
the<00:01:44.189> height<00:01:44.490> level<00:01:44.939> skeleton<00:01:45.479> traps<00:01:45.750> are

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the height level skeleton traps are

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.429 
the height level skeleton traps are
actually<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:47.009> little<00:01:47.820> mini<00:01:48.060> tanks<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
actually like little mini tanks so you

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.520 
actually like little mini tanks so you
just<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.119> damage<00:01:51.420> overall<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
just have to do more damage overall to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.340 
just have to do more damage overall to
win

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
win

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.020 
win
so<00:01:53.830> yeah<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:56.020> these<00:01:56.350> little<00:01:56.759> changes<00:01:57.759> in<00:01:57.909> the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
so yeah all these little changes in the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.710 
so yeah all these little changes in the
game<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.479> making<00:01:58.840> bartsch<00:01:59.320> harder<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:01.450> is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
game is making bartsch harder but it is

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.530 
game is making bartsch harder but it is
still<00:02:02.020> perfect<00:02:02.530> doable<00:02:03.130> as<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.850> can<00:02:03.970> see<00:02:04.180> here

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
still perfect doable as you can see here

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:14.479 
still perfect doable as you can see here
a<00:02:04.720> whim<00:02:05.229> without<00:02:05.470> clan<00:02:06.130> castle<00:02:06.369> or<00:02:06.850> spells

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.720 

okay<00:02:15.489> up<00:02:15.760> next<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:16.569> have<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:17.140> max<00:02:17.500> defense<00:02:18.160> with

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
okay up next we have a max defense with

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.090 
okay up next we have a max defense with
Lego<00:02:19.150> walls<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.620> should<00:02:20.830> be<00:02:20.920> pretty

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
Lego walls but this should be pretty

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.699 
Lego walls but this should be pretty
easy<00:02:21.489> because<00:02:22.150> most<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.840> his<00:02:23.020> buildings<00:02:23.440> are

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
easy because most of his buildings are

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.420 
easy because most of his buildings are
on<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> outside<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.800> take<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.130> look<00:02:27.220> at

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
on the outside and if you take a look at

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
on the outside and if you take a look at
his<00:02:27.580> face<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.790> see<00:02:28.209> all<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.600> empty<00:02:28.959> spaces

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
his face you see all the empty spaces

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.509 
his face you see all the empty spaces
inside<00:02:29.650> his<00:02:30.580> face<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.340> not

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
inside his face that like it's not

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.520 
inside his face that like it's not
guaranteed<00:02:33.790> but<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.930> gives<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.319> an<00:02:35.440> idea

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
guaranteed but that gives you an idea

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.509 
guaranteed but that gives you an idea
that<00:02:37.019> most<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.260> his<00:02:38.440> head<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.769> Tesla's<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
that most of his head and Tesla's and

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.660 
that most of his head and Tesla's and
giant<00:02:39.880> bombs<00:02:40.060> are<00:02:40.420> probably<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.350> his<00:02:41.560> base<00:02:41.860> but

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
giant bombs are probably in his base but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.040 
giant bombs are probably in his base but
you<00:02:42.790> should<00:02:42.819> still<00:02:43.120> try<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> bait<00:02:43.750> out<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you should still try to bait out the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.840 
you should still try to bait out the
giant<00:02:44.380> bombs<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.920> just<00:02:45.069> in<00:02:45.190> case<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.580> wanted

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
giant bombs it's just in case you wanted

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.990 
giant bombs it's just in case you wanted
to<00:02:45.910> troll<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.830> anyway<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.100> just<00:02:48.489> dropped

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
to troll you anyway so I just dropped

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.780 
to troll you anyway so I just dropped
the<00:02:49.120> Giants<00:02:49.660> first<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.290> tank<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.220> send<00:02:51.670> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the Giants first to tank and send it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.120 
the Giants first to tank and send it
archers<00:02:52.390> sort<00:02:53.019> of<00:02:53.080> sending<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.650> barbs<00:02:54.010> and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
archers sort of sending the barbs and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.920 
archers sort of sending the barbs and
the<00:02:54.250> archers<00:02:54.720> got<00:02:55.720> yada<00:02:55.989> yada<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:58.750> guy

the archers got yada yada and this guy

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.110 
the archers got yada yada and this guy
clearly<00:02:58.989> doesn't<00:02:59.769> need<00:03:00.040> any<00:03:00.250> more<00:03:00.519> resources

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
