00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.770

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.320
 gaudin de phew 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.060
 originally in the fifteenth century the word 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.040
 slut her appoint a woman who 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.660
 not tidying his room his designated not 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.070
 a light girl like today 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.500

 but it's weird anyway 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.190
 and as time goes on I think 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.170
 that the slut became the slut 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.910
 only we know it's crazy 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.880

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.150
 the fact that when you do not tidy 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.709

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.170

 obliged to take it badly 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.330
 there may be an opportunity for chance 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.800
