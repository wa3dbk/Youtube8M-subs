00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
i have the promote control and the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.819 
i have the promote control and the
problem<00:00:52.989> i<00:00:53.079> have<00:00:53.260> with<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.440> promote<00:00:53.800> control

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
problem i have with the promote control

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.599 
problem i have with the promote control
is<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.989> even<00:00:56.800> though<00:00:57.039> i<00:00:57.070> use<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.280> really

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
is this even though i use the really

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.500 
is this even though i use the really
right<00:00:57.760> stuff<00:00:57.789> l<00:00:58.090> bracket<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:59.379> cable<00:00:59.859> is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
right stuff l bracket the cable is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.119 
right stuff l bracket the cable is
straight<00:01:01.510> so<00:01:02.289> i<00:01:02.320> actually<00:01:02.590> have<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:02.949> get<00:01:03.100> a

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
straight so i actually have to get a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.430 
straight so i actually have to get a
converter<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:06.010> angle<00:01:06.670> my<00:01:06.820> USB<00:01:07.720> cable<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:08.170> i<00:01:08.200> can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
converter to angle my USB cable so i can

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.350 
converter to angle my USB cable so i can
use<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.680> l-bracket<00:01:09.250> how<00:01:09.820> it's<00:01:10.030> supposed<00:01:10.300> to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
use the l-bracket how it's supposed to

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.450 
use the l-bracket how it's supposed to
be<00:01:10.540> so<00:01:11.110> here<00:01:11.440> we<00:01:11.470> go<00:01:11.560> my<00:01:11.890> main<00:01:12.100> exposure<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:14.070> f<00:01:15.070> 8

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
be so here we go my main exposure is f 8

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.220 
be so here we go my main exposure is f 8
and<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:17.200> at<00:01:18.120> got<00:01:19.120> to<00:01:19.240> start<00:01:19.450> at<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.750> thirtieth

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
and it's at got to start at a thirtieth

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.140 
and it's at got to start at a thirtieth
of<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.350> second<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.930> what<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:22.960> like<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.350> do<00:01:23.530> is
