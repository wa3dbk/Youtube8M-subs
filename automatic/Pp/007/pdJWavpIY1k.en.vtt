00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
to do is groove the entire thing the

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.749 
to do is groove the entire thing the
epoxy<00:01:26.060> has<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.829> lot<00:01:27.829> more<00:01:27.860> surface<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.579> grab

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
epoxy has a lot more surface to grab

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.819 
epoxy has a lot more surface to grab
ahold<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.990> seems<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.259> work<00:01:30.470> very<00:01:30.530> well

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
ahold of and it seems to work very well

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.860 
ahold of and it seems to work very well
so<00:01:31.159> once<00:01:31.880> again

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.000 

and<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:38.160> pits<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> grooves<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.480> well<00:01:40.010> similar

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
and it pits and grooves it well similar

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.580 
and it pits and grooves it well similar
to<00:01:41.160> threads<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.580> think<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.330> apostille<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.440> can

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to threads i think the apostille you can

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.690 
to threads i think the apostille you can
run<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.830> nail<00:01:43.980> right<00:01:44.130> over<00:01:44.370> and<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.610> how

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
run your nail right over and see how

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.250 
run your nail right over and see how
