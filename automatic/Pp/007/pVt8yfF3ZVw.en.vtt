the<00:00:00.989> time<00:00:01.199> waster<00:00:01.530> that's<00:00:01.770> similar<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.310> a

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
the time waster that's similar to a

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.460 
the time waster that's similar to a
funnel<00:00:02.909> it<00:00:05.690> is<00:00:06.690> easier<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.109> make<00:00:07.290> than<00:00:07.410> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
funnel it is easier to make than a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.650 
funnel it is easier to make than a
funnel<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:08.790> take<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> whole<00:00:09.210> sheet<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.450> card

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
funnel you take a whole sheet of card

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.970 
funnel you take a whole sheet of card
stock<00:00:09.719> paper<00:00:10.940> you<00:00:11.940> cut<00:00:12.179> from<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> corner<00:00:13.410> in

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
stock paper you cut from a corner in

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.220 
stock paper you cut from a corner in
towards<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> center<00:00:14.839> and<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.020> play

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
towards the center and you can play

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.779 
towards the center and you can play
around<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> figure<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.100> what

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
around with this to figure out what

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.810 
around with this to figure out what
works<00:00:18.000> best<00:00:18.529> again<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> hole<00:00:20.100> that's

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
works best again you make a hole that's

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.279 
works best again you make a hole that's
a<00:00:20.970> little<00:00:21.210> bit<00:00:21.300> larger<00:00:21.660> than<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> size<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
a little bit larger than the size of the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.480 
a little bit larger than the size of the
marble<00:00:27.529> sort<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.369> what

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
marble sort of like that and then what

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.620 
marble sort of like that and then what
you<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.699> you're<00:00:29.849> overlap<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.510> two<00:00:30.720> edges

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.080 

so<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.840> something<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:38.090> then

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
so it would be something like this then

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.869 
so it would be something like this then
you<00:00:39.120> tape<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.719> place<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.610> like<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
you tape that into place I like to put a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
you tape that into place I like to put a
piece<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.059> tape<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> front<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
piece of tape on the front and on the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.600 
piece of tape on the front and on the
back<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> funnel<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> be

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
back and just like the funnel has to be

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
back and just like the funnel has to be
very<00:00:50.820> secure<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.329> does<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.079> would<00:00:52.230> say

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
very secure so does this I would say

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
very secure so does this I would say
you'd<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> support<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.000> you'd<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you'd want to support here you'd want to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.630 
you'd want to support here you'd want to
support<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> support<00:00:56.489> here

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
support here you want to support here

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
support here you want to support here
and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> support<00:00:57.390> over<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and you want to support over on this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
and you want to support over on this
opposite<00:00:59.039> corner<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> hole<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
opposite corner from the hole and this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
opposite corner from the hole and this
one<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.199> probably<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> most<00:01:01.680> important

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
one is probably the most important

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
one is probably the most important
because<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.570> piece<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> tape<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because this one this piece of tape that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
because this one this piece of tape that
you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.559> attached<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.369> support<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you have attached to your support is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.870 
you have attached to your support is
what<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> move<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.290> down<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.880> really

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
what you can move up and down and really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.039 
what you can move up and down and really
if<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:09.869> stable<00:01:11.540> time<00:01:12.540> waster

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
if you have a very stable time waster

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.830 
if you have a very stable time waster
and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> move<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.330> opposite

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and you can move this at this opposite

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
and you can move this at this opposite
corner<00:01:16.110> from<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> hole<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.830> down<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
corner from the hole up and down you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.719 
corner from the hole up and down you
want<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.150> almost<00:01:19.080> flat<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> were

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
want it to be almost flat so if I were

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
want it to be almost flat so if I were
to<00:01:20.759> drop<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> marble<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.750> I'd<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> roll

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to drop the marble here I'd want to roll

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
to drop the marble here I'd want to roll
very<00:01:23.159> slowly<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> hole<00:01:24.360> even<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
very slowly to the hole even that was a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
very slowly to the hole even that was a
little<00:01:25.530> fast<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:27.030> where<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
little fast now where you want the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
little fast now where you want the
marble<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.560> enter<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> time<00:01:29.280> waster<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
marble that enter this time waster is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
marble that enter this time waster is
from<00:01:30.240> either<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.750> side<00:01:30.990> over<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.290> with

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
from either this side over here with

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.410 
from either this side over here with
this<00:01:32.220> side<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:33.140> because<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> does

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
this side over here because what it does

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.399 
this side over here because what it does
what<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.259> roll

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
what it will do is it will just roll

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.690 
what it will do is it will just roll
back<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.920> forth<00:01:40.250> until<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.310> finally<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
back and forth until it finally the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.100 
back and forth until it finally the
finest<00:01:41.970> weight<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> hole<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.840> instead<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
finest weight of the hole so instead of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.330 
finest weight of the hole so instead of
spin<00:01:43.320> around<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> circle<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.220> goes

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
spin around in a circle it just goes

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
spin around in a circle it just goes
back<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> forth<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.680> test

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
back and forth and you can test

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
back and forth and you can test
different<00:01:48.240> places<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.990> drop<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:51.290> figure<00:01:52.290> out

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
different places to drop it figure out

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.069 
different places to drop it figure out
what<00:01:52.530> works<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.920> best<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:54.149> slide

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
what works the best and then just slide

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.510 
what works the best and then just slide
the<00:01:55.229> tape<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.770> down<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> move<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> tape

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the tape up and down and move the tape

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
the tape up and down and move the tape
up<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.090> different<00:01:57.990> corners<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
up and down on different corners and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
up and down on different corners and
till<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> longest<00:02:00.390> amount<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> time

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
till you get the longest amount of time

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
till you get the longest amount of time
possible
