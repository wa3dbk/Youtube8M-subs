improper charging of RC light poly

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.900 
improper charging of RC light poly
batteries<00:01:09.170> because<00:01:09.380> when<00:01:09.770> they<00:01:09.980> explode<00:01:10.430> they

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
batteries because when they explode they

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.060 
batteries because when they explode they
explode<00:01:11.360> grade<00:01:11.720> making<00:01:12.470> things<00:01:12.680> catching

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
explode grade making things catching

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.890 
explode grade making things catching
fire<00:01:13.280> around<00:01:13.490> them<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.690> bag

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
fire around them so this is the bag

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.410 
fire around them so this is the bag
which<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.320> very<00:01:15.650> nice<00:01:16.370> solution<00:01:16.790> i<00:01:17.120> think

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
which is a very nice solution i think

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.270 
which is a very nice solution i think
you<00:01:17.480> can<00:01:17.660> find<00:01:17.960> these<00:01:18.170> kinds<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.650> bags<00:01:18.920> i<00:01:19.130> would

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
you can find these kinds of bags i would

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.980 
you can find these kinds of bags i would
recommend<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.150> find<00:01:20.390> these<00:01:20.570> kinds<00:01:20.900> of

recommend you to find these kinds of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.500 
recommend you to find these kinds of
bags<00:01:21.230> around<00:01:21.590> your<00:01:21.830> local<00:01:22.070> hobby<00:01:22.400> shops<00:01:22.760> they

bags around your local hobby shops they

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.040 
bags around your local hobby shops they
are<00:01:23.750> fireproof<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.730> you<00:01:25.730> can<00:01:25.910> simply<00:01:26.210> put<00:01:27.020> a

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
are fireproof and you can simply put a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.950 
are fireproof and you can simply put a
lipoly<00:01:27.620> battery<00:01:27.620> inside<00:01:31.330> take<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.510> connector

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
lipoly battery inside take the connector

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.590 
lipoly battery inside take the connector
out<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.490> connect<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.820> your<00:01:34.850> charger<00:01:35.360> like

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
out and connect it to your charger like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.720 
out and connect it to your charger like
for<00:01:35.810> example<00:01:35.900> this<00:01:36.440> f<00:01:36.710> six<00:01:36.980> charges<00:01:37.280> sitting

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
for example this f six charges sitting

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.800 
for example this f six charges sitting
here<00:01:38.030> i<00:01:38.210> will<00:01:38.720> simply<00:01:39.380> say<00:01:40.990> red<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.230> red<00:01:43.810> black

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
here i will simply say red to red black

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.290 
here i will simply say red to red black
to<00:01:45.020> black<00:01:45.290> let's<00:01:45.920> um<00:01:46.250> let's<00:01:46.520> imagine<00:01:47.090> this

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
to black let's um let's imagine this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.170 
to black let's um let's imagine this
assume<00:01:48.200> discharges<00:01:48.830> connected<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.880> connect

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
assume discharges connected you connect

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.330 
assume discharges connected you connect
the<00:01:50.270> battery<00:01:50.690> turn<00:01:51.230> on<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> charger<00:01:51.860> on<00:01:52.040> and

the battery turn on the charger on and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240 
the battery turn on the charger on and
start<00:01:52.670> charging<00:01:53.150> now<00:01:53.630> if<00:01:53.960> somehow<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.590> forgot

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
start charging now if somehow you forgot

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.220 
start charging now if somehow you forgot
about<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:55.580> recharging<00:01:56.390> if<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.930> are<00:01:57.050> lucky

like me and using a very intelligent
valid<00:02:00.110> charger<00:02:00.530> don't<00:02:00.920> worry<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.460> will<00:02:02.210> just

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
valid charger don't worry it will just

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.180 
valid charger don't worry it will just
turn<00:02:02.630> off<00:02:02.690> automatically<00:02:03.590> after<00:02:03.830> charging

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
turn off automatically after charging

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.480
