 God, what did you think of Ventura? 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.419
 that we had at the imea theme park o 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.779
 bush flatter and mary laine launched 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.029
 which I did already saved nothing much 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.250
 his invention called that day that translator 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.760
 It only worked in the last second. 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.710
 as he said before and in the 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.629
 information to know what to do 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.019
 when to do instead of getting some 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.220
 running around the jokes truth effect 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.690
 but it was still an adventure way 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.850
 We need to name them. 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.680
 so we can always make a list of 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.629
 every time we screw up plans 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.580
 I wanted to see your face. 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.470
 term nose hair in a list 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.280
 accurate of all the times they spoil the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.500
 his plans very interesting to 55 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.010
 where when my calls were 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 made have to increase said let the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.890
 My mommy idea is that such a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.580
 unsuccessful doctor theme park 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 eggman a great potential ranking with 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 the experiment the colon exported from 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.759
 powers of things 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.490
 I already know how good colors sonic colors are. 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 but it was not lacking in the south because you went 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.220
 always the same color throughout 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.220
 adventure, I do not
