00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.890
 a greeting 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.770
 welcome saun like again 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.990
 this is still a video on how 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.220
 make embedded and how to draw 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
 our format 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.160
 remember that there are always 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.259
 a maxim that we have to respect is 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.600
 a maximum that all the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.820
 professional cartoonists 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.610
 and always work from the general to the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.910
 particular 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.550
 in the greatest detail after the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.860
 detail is never the first 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.210
 and now we will reply first of all 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.969
 that we have to take into account 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.329
 a maxim that is very important for the 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.570
 drawing and painting this maxim is and is 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.110
 a phrase that they repeated to me 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.110
 while studying 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.400
 in the faculty of fine arts and other 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.130
 that I also repeat to my 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.630
 students 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.090
 the maximum from the general to the particular 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.869
 and we can never go from 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.869
 to draw 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.380
 and pretend that after the eye on the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.140
 another eye is the same as the nose we 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.509
 come out perfect and then the mouth is left 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 well we are not already beginning to look 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.810
 just one detail and try to create the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.130
 I'm drawing because I'm going to explain 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.130
 if this is our format 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.010
 and we started to draw an eye 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.410
 and we want to draw the whole person 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.330
 when we draw our other eye and 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.940
 let's draw our nose we realize 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.670
 that we face no longer fits hair and 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.770
 in the face we no longer have the hair 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.109
 hair we would have to expand the format 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.259
 to center the face many times we 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.700
 happens that's why I say from the general to 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.229
 the particular 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.229
 If you have more our format 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.080
 if we have bushes our formats 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.760
 the ideals of the general 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.120
 with the hair part and then 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.470
 how particular the details are never 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.470
 you have to do the details 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.400
 the details are roasted after a 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.560
 Fitted full figure 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.670
 comes to be the most fun part is the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.260
 filling part 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.700
 in the part that gives us the resemblance and is 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.640
 with which we will enjoy much more 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.870
 that's why I always say you have to do what 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.110
 general to the particular 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.000
 this maxim will always serve us for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.049
 the time to go doing any figure 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.049
 any drawing 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.150
 can have in a format 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.470
 very big 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.689
 of drawing start to draw what is the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.689
 head what is the part of the hair 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.700
 and then we go after knowing where 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.810
 everything else goes there is no detail 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.760
 there is only one 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.410
 here I know that I will place the shoulders 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.420
 here I know that I'm going to place everything else 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.420
 I already know where I'm going to place my eyebrows 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.210
 but I'm never going to start drawing a 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.110
 eye 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.230
 without having done something generic 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.540
 the eye is a detail in the nose is a 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.519
 detail the mouth is a detail 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.349
 you will have seen that there are many cartoonists 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.569
 they start to draw especially if 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.069
 let's measure by barcelona 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.689
 in the city that you always carry and 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.130
 someone who gets in the street of 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.720
 look for portraits 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 many of the people who draw 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.690
 portraits on the street have a very eye 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.000
 educated have a view 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.560
 defined and they know what they do are 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.810
 professionals and have been drawing for years 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.780
 if you 've been drawing it for years 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.239
 you intend to start with one eye and then 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.700
 continue and that the drawing goes well not 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.650
 pretend to draw a body started to 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.830
 draw a hand a day because the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.160
 rest contains the ones provided 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.290
 thank you very much thank you very much for having 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.180
 seen the video if you want to learn and 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.160
 keep learning how to draw and how 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.269
 it paints to return to the page again 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.229
