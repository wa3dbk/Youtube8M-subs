after<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.450> 1911<00:00:00.870> electric<00:00:01.740> Cadillac<00:00:03.380> we

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
after the 1911 electric Cadillac we

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.499 
after the 1911 electric Cadillac we
didn't<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.890> use<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.390> crank<00:00:06.390> starter

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
didn't have to use a crank starter

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.140 
didn't have to use a crank starter
anymore<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.429> electric<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.670> became<00:00:08.970> an

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
anymore so electric just became an

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.400 
anymore so electric just became an

invented the idea of nickel batteries
going<00:00:50.430> back<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.030> electric<00:00:51.539> car

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
going back to the first electric car

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
going back to the first electric car
batteries<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.430> ones<00:00:53.699> were<00:00:53.910> sort<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
batteries the first ones were sort of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.630 
batteries the first ones were sort of
primitive<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.899> had<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> promise

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
primitive that they had a lot of promise

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
primitive that they had a lot of promise
so<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.820> 1990<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> impact<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.829> driven

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so in 1990 when the impact was driven

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920 
so in 1990 when the impact was driven
into<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> auto<00:00:59.879> center<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.570> looked<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
into the auto center it looked like a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.299 
into the auto center it looked like a
sure<00:01:01.260> thing<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> nickel<00:01:02.070> metal<00:01:02.100> hydride

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
sure thing the nickel metal hydride

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039 
sure thing the nickel metal hydride
would<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> battery<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.539> choice<00:01:03.780> for

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
would be the battery of choice for

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.859 
would be the battery of choice for
electric<00:01:04.409> cars<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> original<00:01:06.150> ev1<00:01:06.630> was

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
electric cars the original ev1 was

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.640 
electric cars the original ev1 was
designed<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.860> aerodynamic<00:01:08.630> excellence

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
designed with for aerodynamic excellence

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.929 
designed with for aerodynamic excellence
because<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.890> were<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.340> lead<00:01:11.549> acid

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
because they were going to use lead acid

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
because they were going to use lead acid
batteries<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:12.630> had<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.990> mind<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.590> bad

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
batteries and they had in mind the bad

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.090 
batteries and they had in mind the bad
SLI<00:01:14.520> batteries<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:16.259> didn't<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> using

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
SLI batteries they didn't think of using

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.179

us now in 1996 when General Motors
brought<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> ev1<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:06.540> brought<00:02:06.780> out

about<00:02:58.319> 90<00:02:58.680> degrees<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.939> battery

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
about 90 degrees so the battery

compartment<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.209> not<00:03:06.389> refrigerated<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.920> what

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
compartment is not refrigerated so what

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.309 
compartment is not refrigerated so what
is<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.400> secret<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.939> this<00:03:09.090> rav4<00:03:09.540> Evi<00:03:10.109> what

is the secret of this rav4 Evi what

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.379 
is the secret of this rav4 Evi what
makes<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.769> go<00:03:10.980> like<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.489> Honda<00:03:11.670> IDI<00:03:12.030> used<00:03:12.239> to

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
makes it go like the Honda IDI used to

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.509 
makes it go like the Honda IDI used to
do<00:03:12.510> over<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> hundred<00:03:13.170> miles<00:03:13.379> on<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.739> charge<00:03:13.799> and

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
1.45 is sort of the upward limit so it's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720 
1.45 is sort of the upward limit so it's
it's<00:03:33.959> pretty<00:03:34.199> much<00:03:34.319> comparable<00:03:34.859> as<00:03:35.159> in<00:03:35.639> a

like<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.449> balloon<00:03:48.659> when<00:03:49.079> it's<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.409> when<00:03:49.680> it's

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
like a balloon when it's in when it's

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.849 
like a balloon when it's in when it's
charged<00:03:50.310> up<00:03:50.579> so<00:03:51.569> that<00:03:51.840> band<00:03:52.109> actually<00:03:52.560> holds

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
charged up so that band actually holds

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.009 
charged up so that band actually holds
it<00:03:52.949> in<00:03:53.069> place<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.609> we<00:03:54.329> can<00:03:54.479> actually<00:03:54.659> measure

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
it in place so we can actually measure

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.960 
it in place so we can actually measure
what<00:03:55.199> these<00:03:55.500> cells<00:03:55.829> are<00:03:56.159> and<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.609> can<00:03:56.760> see

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
what these cells are and you can see

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.969 
what these cells are and you can see
that<00:03:57.150> what<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.750> battery<00:03:58.139> does<00:03:58.379> this<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.859> the

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
that what this battery does this is the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.670 
that what this battery does this is the
battery<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.849> only<00:04:00.180> battery<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:01.290> enables

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
battery the only battery that enables

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.500 
battery the only battery that enables
electric<00:04:02.129> cars<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.459> do<00:04:02.669> more<00:04:02.879> than<00:04:03.030> 100<00:04:03.329> miles

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
electric cars to do more than 100 miles

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.819 
electric cars to do more than 100 miles
for<00:04:04.470> over<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> hundred<00:04:05.400> thousand<00:04:06.000> miles<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.780> far

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
for over a hundred thousand miles so far

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.490 
for over a hundred thousand miles so far
no<00:04:07.829> other<00:04:07.979> battery<00:04:08.459> has<00:04:08.609> ever<00:04:08.760> done<00:04:08.940> this

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
no other battery has ever done this

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.839 
no other battery has ever done this
lever<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.709> its<00:04:10.889> cell<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.430> 0.95<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.159> 1.2

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
lever see its cell is 0.95 it can be 1.2

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.430 
lever see its cell is 0.95 it can be 1.2
is<00:04:15.030> where<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.269> should<00:04:15.479> be<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.139> doesn't

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
is where it should be but it doesn't

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.560 
is where it should be but it doesn't
hurt<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> keep<00:04:16.919> these<00:04:17.159> things<00:04:17.299> discharged

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
hurt to keep these things discharged

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.159 
hurt to keep these things discharged
so<00:04:19.409> this<00:04:19.620> one<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.919> 0.94<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.719> whole<00:04:21.840> pack

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
so this one is 0.94 and the whole pack

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.940 
so this one is 0.94 and the whole pack
is<00:04:22.440> probably<00:04:22.860> around<00:04:23.130> 10<00:04:23.690> 10<00:04:24.690> volts<00:04:25.139> because

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
is probably around 10 10 volts because

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.230 
is probably around 10 10 volts because
it<00:04:26.099> isn't<00:04:26.250> charged

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
it isn't charged

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.969 
it isn't charged
and<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.750> likes<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.020> be<00:04:28.199> kept<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.560> assists<00:04:28.860> in

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
and it likes to be kept in assists in

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.400 
and it likes to be kept in assists in
the<00:04:29.130> status<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.789> uncharged<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.990> wondering<00:04:31.289> if

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
the status of uncharged so wondering if

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.960 
the status of uncharged so wondering if
this<00:04:31.560> round<00:04:31.860> 4<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:32.780> 288<00:04:33.780> volts<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.699> this<00:04:35.699> kind

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
this round 4 is 288 volts of this kind

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.449 
this round 4 is 288 volts of this kind
of<00:04:36.090> battery
