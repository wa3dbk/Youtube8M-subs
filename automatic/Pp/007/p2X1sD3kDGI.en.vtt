here's<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:52.140> example<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
here's an example of it you can see it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
here's an example of it you can see it
squeezes<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.719> between<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> openings<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
squeezes in between the openings in the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
squeezes in between the openings in the
lath<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
lath I don't know if you can get a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660 
lath I don't know if you can get a
cross-sectional<00:00:58.859> view<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.489> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
cross-sectional view of that or not but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.630 
cross-sectional view of that or not but
you'll<00:00:59.820> notice<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:01.530> color<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.160> plaster<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you'll notice this color of plaster is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.070 
you'll notice this color of plaster is
different<00:01:02.940> than<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.120> white<00:01:03.420> layer<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
different than this white layer and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
different than this white layer and
that's<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> base<00:01:05.189> coat<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that's because this is the base coat the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
that's because this is the base coat the
scratch<00:01:06.270> coat<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> finish<00:01:07.950> coat

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
scratch coat and this is the finish coat

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.880 
scratch coat and this is the finish coat
and<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.820> zoom<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.860> anyway

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and if you can zoom in there anyway

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.910 
and if you can zoom in there anyway

demonstration purposes we did not if you
look<00:01:46.740> pan<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> camera<00:01:47.460> down<00:01:47.880> you'll<00:01:48.119> see

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329

look pan the camera down you'll see
there's<00:01:48.509> no<00:01:48.570> laughs<00:01:49.020> mixed<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.460> step<00:01:50.790> one

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
there's no laughs mixed up so step one

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.840 
there's no laughs mixed up so step one
is<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:53.009> simply<00:01:53.520> remove<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.229> plaster<00:01:55.850> which

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
is to simply remove the plaster which

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.260 
is to simply remove the plaster which
then<00:01:57.740> leads<00:01:58.740> us<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> step<00:01:59.159> two<00:01:59.340> which<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
then leads us to step two which is to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
then leads us to step two which is to
pull<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.899> laugh<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.250> wouldn't<00:02:02.490> laugh

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
pull the laugh down that wouldn't laugh

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.810 
pull the laugh down that wouldn't laugh
and<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.020> construction

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
this as kindling I don't it really

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.830 
this as kindling I don't it really
doesn't<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.530> much<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.950> reuse

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
doesn't have much of a reuse

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.390 
doesn't have much of a reuse
unfortunately<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.140> could<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.740> it's<00:02:16.010> hard<00:02:16.310> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
unfortunately I could be it's hard to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.120 
unfortunately I could be it's hard to
turn<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.730> multiple<00:02:17.360> males<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:18.590> anyway

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
turn to multiple males but anyway

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.960 
turn to multiple males but anyway
step<00:02:19.880> two<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.210> very<00:02:20.750> important<00:02:21.230> which<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.970> no

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
step two is very important which is no

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.940 
step two is very important which is no
way<00:02:23.240> shape<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:24.050> form<00:02:24.110> should<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.530> plaster<00:02:24.920> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
way shape or form should the plaster and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.740 
way shape or form should the plaster and
lath<00:02:25.070> come<00:02:25.370> down<00:02:25.520> together<00:02:25.640> because<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
lath come down together because then the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.420 
lath come down together because then the
laughs<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> plaster<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.890> all<00:02:27.980> mixed<00:02:28.190> up

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
laughs and the plaster is all mixed up

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.460 
laughs and the plaster is all mixed up
and<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.580> can't<00:02:28.790> shovel<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.210> which<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.260> what

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
and you can't shovel it which is what

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.250 
and you can't shovel it which is what
I'm<00:02:30.800> doing<00:02:31.040> now<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.180> by<00:02:32.360> separating<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:33.020> into

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
I'm doing now so by separating that into

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.240 
I'm doing now so by separating that into
soot<00:02:33.470> two<00:02:33.710> steps

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
soot two steps

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.880 
soot two steps
it<00:02:34.700> makes<00:02:34.910> removal<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.750> lot<00:02:35.930> easier<00:02:36.260> which<00:02:36.770> is

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
it makes removal a lot easier which is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 
it makes removal a lot easier which is
what<00:02:37.010> we're<00:02:37.160> doing<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.600> plaster<00:02:38.600> all<00:02:38.720> down

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
what we're doing so plaster all down

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.780 
what we're doing so plaster all down
then<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> lap<00:02:39.920> down<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.370> out<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.550> window

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
then the lap down and out the window

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.640 
then the lap down and out the window
leaving<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> plaster<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.470> room

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
leaving just the plaster in the room

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.600 
leaving just the plaster in the room
which<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.550> then<00:02:45.070> shovel<00:02:46.070> into<00:02:46.280> these<00:02:46.400> buckets

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
which we then shovel into these buckets

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.370 
which we then shovel into these buckets
and<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:49.280> team<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.940> us<00:02:50.120> which<00:02:50.630> tonight<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.170> just

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
from the soil and life is good so we can

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.039 
from the soil and life is good so we can
actually<00:03:42.820> essentially<00:03:43.820> recycle<00:03:44.510> this

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049
