this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> 45<00:00:16.320> year<00:00:16.560> old<00:00:16.650> woman<00:00:16.859> who<00:00:17.160> fell

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
this is a 45 year old woman who fell

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150 
this is a 45 year old woman who fell
down<00:00:17.760> three<00:00:18.150> steps<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.810> she<00:00:19.470> landed<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.949> her

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
down three steps and she landed on her

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.210 
down three steps and she landed on her
right<00:00:20.369> outstretched<00:00:21.060> hand<00:00:21.800> she<00:00:22.800> had<00:00:22.890> some

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
right outstretched hand she had some

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.970 
right outstretched hand she had some
pain<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.060> swelling<00:00:24.630> over<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> lateral<00:00:25.680> part

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
pain and swelling over the lateral part

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.880 
pain and swelling over the lateral part
of<00:00:26.130> her<00:00:26.340> elbow<00:00:26.730> when<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.480> examined<00:00:27.960> her<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.710> well

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
of her elbow when I examined her as well

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.519 
of her elbow when I examined her as well
as<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.160> pain<00:00:29.369> over<00:00:29.609> her<00:00:29.760> distal<00:00:30.150> radius<00:00:30.529> her

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
as some pain over her distal radius her

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.040 
as some pain over her distal radius her
elbow<00:00:31.920> flexion<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.579> also<00:00:32.880> decreased<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.809> she

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
elbow flexion is also decreased and she

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.010 
elbow flexion is also decreased and she
was<00:00:34.140> paying<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.590> supination<00:00:35.420> okay<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.480> what

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
was paying with supination okay so what

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
was paying with supination okay so what
do<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> think's<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:39.090> she

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
do you think's going on here I think she

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
do you think's going on here I think she
just<00:00:39.329> has<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> simple<00:00:39.989> sprain<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> her<00:00:41.040> elbow

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
just has a simple sprain of her elbow

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.979 
just has a simple sprain of her elbow
and<00:00:41.579> wrist<00:00:42.020> okay<00:00:43.020> um<00:00:43.800> did<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.550> about

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
and wrist okay um did you think about

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
and wrist okay um did you think about
anything<00:00:45.989> more<00:00:46.230> serious<00:00:46.469> well<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.520> looked<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
anything more serious well I looked for

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
anything more serious well I looked for
a<00:00:47.969> fracture<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> x-ray<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.829> didn't<00:00:50.160> see

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
a fracture on the x-ray and I didn't see

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
a fracture on the x-ray and I didn't see
any<00:00:50.430> fractures<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> elbow<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> wrist

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
any fractures of the elbow or the wrist

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.160 
any fractures of the elbow or the wrist
um<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> palpated<00:00:54.239> over<00:00:54.420> her<00:00:54.570> snuffbox

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
um and when I palpated over her snuffbox

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.560 
um and when I palpated over her snuffbox
she<00:00:56.010> didn't<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.399> any<00:00:56.670> pain<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.149> tenderness

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
she didn't have any pain or tenderness

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660 
she didn't have any pain or tenderness
so<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.260> scaphoid<00:00:58.710> fracture<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> quite

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so I think a scaphoid fracture is quite

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.299 
so I think a scaphoid fracture is quite
unlikely<00:01:00.530> what<00:01:01.530> we'll<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.890> we'll<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
unlikely what we'll do is we'll go and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.189 
unlikely what we'll do is we'll go and
take<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> look<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> x-rays<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.080> do

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
take a look at the x-rays and when we do

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.660 
take a look at the x-rays and when we do
I<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> take<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> good<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I want you to take a good look at the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.880 
I want you to take a good look at the
lateral<00:01:06.180> view<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> elbow<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
lateral view of the of the elbow and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730 
lateral view of the of the elbow and
look<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> sale<00:01:09.299> sign<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
look for a sale sign so you see that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
look for a sale sign so you see that
when<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> fat<00:01:11.369> pads<00:01:11.700> elevated<00:01:12.600> by

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
when the fat pads elevated by

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
when the fat pads elevated by
intra-articular<00:01:13.500> hemorrhage<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
intra-articular hemorrhage and that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
intra-articular hemorrhage and that
sometimes<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> only<00:01:16.170> sign<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.830> arc

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
sometimes can be the only sign of an arc

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
sometimes can be the only sign of an arc
radial<00:01:17.549> head<00:01:17.700> fracture<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.840> let's<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.530> take<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
radial head fracture so let's go take a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.230 
radial head fracture so let's go take a
look

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.460 

you<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.330> right<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> fractured

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you were right to think of a fractured

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
you were right to think of a fractured
scaphoid<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> mechanism<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:27.000> injury

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
scaphoid with that mechanism of injury

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.749 
scaphoid with that mechanism of injury
but<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.130> lack<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> tenderness

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
but I think with the lack of tenderness

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
but I think with the lack of tenderness
and<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.360> normal<00:01:30.630> x-ray<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.439> rolls

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and the normal x-ray I think that rolls

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.210 
and the normal x-ray I think that rolls
it<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.450> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.259> she<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:34.710> does

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it out but I do think she probably does

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.030 
it out but I do think she probably does
have<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> fractured<00:01:35.970> radial<00:01:36.299> head<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.890> look

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
have a fractured radial head if you look

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
have a fractured radial head if you look
at<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.310> sale<00:01:38.579> sign<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
at this sale sign here you can see the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
at this sale sign here you can see the
elevated<00:01:40.920> fat<00:01:41.280> pad<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> even<00:01:42.360> though<00:01:42.479> we

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
elevated fat pad and even though we

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.080 
elevated fat pad and even though we
can't<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> fracture<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.579> radial<00:01:44.939> head

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
can't see a fracture on the radial head

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330 
can't see a fracture on the radial head
itself<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.079> infer<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.590> from<00:01:46.619> seeing<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
itself we can infer it from seeing that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.999 
itself we can infer it from seeing that
so<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.140> should<00:01:49.320> treat<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
so I think we should treat it for that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:02:02.490 
so I think we should treat it for that
okay<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.700> we'll<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:50.909> back<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.090> see<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:51.540> sure

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.560 

you
