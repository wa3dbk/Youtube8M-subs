00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
buying this game but he never did and we

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.240 
buying this game but he never did and we
were<00:00:52.079> talking<00:00:52.379> about<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.219> I

really<00:01:12.450> say<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.670> all

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
really say what it's like but but all

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.039 
really say what it's like but but all
these<00:01:14.939> games<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.270> pretty<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> kind

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
these games are pretty good this is kind

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
these games are pretty good this is kind
of<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> filler<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.009> take<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> extra

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
of just a filler to take up the extra

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.100 
of just a filler to take up the extra
five<00:01:17.850> bucks<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.509> ten<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
five bucks but this is actually ten so I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.749 
five bucks but this is actually ten so I
went<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.350> over<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> limit<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
went a little over the limit but you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.830 
went a little over the limit but you
know<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.000> worth<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.630> he's

something today like a product I thought
that'd<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> little<00:02:54.210> more<00:02:54.330> exciting<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
that's kind of the root of the problem

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.050 
that's kind of the root of the problem
