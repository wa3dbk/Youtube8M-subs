that's it for under the hood I guess oh

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.480 
that's it for under the hood I guess oh
I<00:04:07.120> also<00:04:07.450> did<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:08.460> throttle<00:04:09.460> body<00:04:09.700> heater<00:04:10.120> bypass

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
I also did a throttle body heater bypass

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.780 
I also did a throttle body heater bypass
see<00:04:12.490> those<00:04:12.700> tubes<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:13.450> there<00:04:14.790> normally

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
see those tubes right there normally

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.170 
see those tubes right there normally
those<00:04:16.120> would<00:04:17.280> heat<00:04:18.280> up<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.610> throttle<00:04:18.880> body

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
those would heat up the throttle body

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.770 
those would heat up the throttle body
but<00:04:19.630> since<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.560> live<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.890> Texas<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:23.290> know<00:04:23.410> the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
but since I live in Texas you know the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.700 
but since I live in Texas you know the
throttle<00:04:25.780> body<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:26.050> never<00:04:26.230> going<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.470> freeze

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
throttle body is never going to freeze

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.680 
throttle body is never going to freeze
up<00:04:26.890> because<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.760> barely<00:04:28.120> ever<00:04:28.240> gets<00:04:28.510> below

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
up because it barely ever gets below

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.080 
up because it barely ever gets below
freezing<00:04:29.020> here<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:30.430> there's<00:04:30.640> no<00:04:30.760> point<00:04:30.940> in

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
freezing here so there's no point in

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.040 
freezing here so there's no point in
having<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.420> throttle<00:04:31.780> body<00:04:31.960> heat<00:04:32.200> of<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:34.050> and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
having a throttle body heat of it and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.620 
having a throttle body heat of it and
you<00:04:35.710> know<00:04:35.830> it'll<00:04:35.980> give<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.640> couple<00:04:37.540> extra

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
you know it'll give you a couple extra

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.400 
you know it'll give you a couple extra
horsepower<00:04:38.080> maybe<00:04:38.590> but<00:04:39.660> since<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.750> figured<00:04:40.990> I

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
horsepower maybe but since I figured I

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.280 
horsepower maybe but since I figured I
don't<00:04:41.980> need<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.490> get<00:04:43.300> rid<00:04:43.420> of<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:44.580> and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
don't need it just get rid of it and

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.670 
don't need it just get rid of it and
it's<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:48.210> straight<00:04:49.210> tail<00:04:49.780> pipe<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.440> got

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
it's a straight tail pipe that I got

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.390 
it's a straight tail pipe that I got
done<00:04:50.980> by<00:04:51.520> just<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:52.060> local<00:04:52.330> muffler<00:04:53.020> shop<00:04:53.400> it's

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
done by just a local muffler shop it's

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.140 
done by just a local muffler shop it's
not<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:54.820> greatest<00:04:55.240> thing

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
