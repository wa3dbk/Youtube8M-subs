00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.550
 here I present the automatic trap 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.550
 for a stick more alone 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.290
 the automatic plot does not exist 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.000
 the floor is moved with the weight of the 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.870
 troop long 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.740
 the doors are very good 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.740
 like everything 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.500
 and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 is reconsidering so that the pigeon 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 recognize the door is loaded 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.450
 when the pigeon enters 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.760
 you come here in the background comes to call the 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.420
 dove 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.420
 when the pigeon enters 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.010
 this cut that has the wood is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.620
 when the palm between 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.360
 do not take the tail with the closures do not 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.810
 take the pigeon's tail but when 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810
 step on here 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.750
 with two pigeons 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.330
 in the mesh 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.259
 already 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.259
 in this screw 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.450
 here this regular weight 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.900
 the weight of the two for the reds more 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.900
 powerful 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.479
 here what you have is a clone is so that 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.500
 walk the door 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.920
 ah 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.710
 Y 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.660
 why 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.690
 at this time the animals 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.430
 organized happy 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.939
 the term 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.939
 ah 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.870
 a space only of the ham is very large 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.950
 another thing 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.050
 the floor so that when the pigeon is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.030
 because it is more enclosed what luck 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.890
 there it was upright so that this in 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.890
 one screw is missing 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:03:01.620
 would hold and the floor still moving the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:04.560
 good spring for the Canary Islands because 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.060
 in the peninsula I do not like that the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.160
 urban styles 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.400
 is that I'm interested in her that I 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:17.959
 call and phone six days 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.959
 10 22 16 days 10 92 92
