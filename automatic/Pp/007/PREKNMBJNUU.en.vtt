00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
can go to the heat I can make a little

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.670 
can go to the heat I can make a little
bit<00:01:05.220> less<00:01:05.430> money<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> little

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
bit less money you know it is a little

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
bit less money you know it is a little
bit<00:01:07.860> less<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> no<00:01:09.060> state

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
bit less because there is no state
