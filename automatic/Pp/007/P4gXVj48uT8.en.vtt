00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
run pretty much all games actually at

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.960 
run pretty much all games actually at

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
Ultra settings at 1440p which is up

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.449 
Ultra settings at 1440p which is up
higher<00:03:30.359> than<00:03:30.629> 1080p<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.410> just<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.129> car<00:03:32.340> just

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
higher than 1080p and just this car just

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.460 
higher than 1080p and just this car just
overall<00:03:32.819> it's<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.090> way<00:03:33.540> too<00:03:33.569> fast<00:03:34.079> for<00:03:34.260> this

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
overall it's just way too fast for this

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.110 
overall it's just way too fast for this
price<00:03:34.650> point<00:03:36.500> now<00:03:37.500> for<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.919> SSD<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.909> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
price point now for the SSD this is the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.740 
price point now for the SSD this is the
pony<00:03:39.599> accelerate<00:03:40.530> SSD<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.909> this<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.389> our<00:03:42.540> first

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750

solid state drive which they are much

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.409 
solid state drive which they are much

faster than hard drives and this is

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.939 
faster than hard drives and this is

drive<00:04:25.180> silver<00:04:25.960> I'm<00:04:26.260> choosing<00:04:26.680> this<00:04:26.740> mainly

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
drive silver I'm choosing this mainly

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.409 
drive silver I'm choosing this mainly
because<00:04:27.070> it's<00:04:27.430> just<00:04:27.610> only<00:04:27.790> five<00:04:28.120> dollars

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
because it's just only five dollars

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.600 
because it's just only five dollars
cheaper<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.199> is<00:04:29.350> by<00:04:29.500> Seagate<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.190> this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
cheaper but this is by Seagate and this

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.129 
cheaper but this is by Seagate and this
also<00:04:30.790> is<00:04:30.970> number<00:04:31.210> one<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.540> good<00:04:31.840> hard

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
also is number one of the good hard

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.070 
also is number one of the good hard
drives<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.500> can<00:04:32.560> get<00:04:32.860> right<00:04:33.070> now<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:34.720> one

you<00:04:59.740> have<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:00.010> OS<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.460> your<00:05:00.639> hard<00:05:00.820> drive<00:05:00.910> aside

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
you have the OS on your hard drive aside

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.900 
you have the OS on your hard drive aside
from<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.780> SS<00:05:02.080> having<00:05:02.740> an<00:05:02.830> OS<00:05:03.070> on<00:05:03.280> your<00:05:03.310> SSD

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
from the SS having an OS on your SSD

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.190 
from the SS having an OS on your SSD
that's<00:05:04.150> where<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.419> major<00:05:04.570> difference<00:05:05.020> is

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
that's where the major difference is

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.840 
that's where the major difference is
fighting<00:05:05.830> games<00:05:06.070> there's<00:05:06.310> not<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.580> much<00:05:06.700> of

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
fighting games there's not that much of

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.610 
fighting games there's not that much of
a<00:05:06.910> difference<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.479> this<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:08.169> still<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> really

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
a difference so this is still a really

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.020 
a difference so this is still a really
good<00:05:08.740> her<00:05:08.889> drive<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.220> get<00:05:09.340> for<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.669> thousand

is a Marko ATX mid tower but the thing
that's<00:05:52.180> really<00:05:52.300> special<00:05:52.570> about<00:05:52.720> is<00:05:52.930> that's

same sort of small architecture that the
original<00:05:58.060> BitFenix<00:05:58.510> prodigy<00:05:58.660> did<00:05:59.139> but<00:05:59.919> since

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
original BitFenix prodigy did but since

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.190 
original BitFenix prodigy did but since
this<00:06:00.430> is<00:06:00.610> micro<00:06:00.970> ATX<00:06:01.150> it'll<00:06:01.750> actually<00:06:01.840> hold

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
this is micro ATX it'll actually hold

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.659 
this is micro ATX it'll actually hold
this<00:06:02.380> motherboard<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:03.099> actually<00:06:03.490> it<00:06:03.639> is

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
this motherboard and actually it is

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.150 
this motherboard and actually it is
surprisingly<00:06:04.599> small<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.349> will<00:06:05.740> still<00:06:05.950> hold

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
surprisingly small and will still hold

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.460 
surprisingly small and will still hold
your<00:06:06.400> humongous<00:06:07.000> graphics<00:06:07.419> card<00:06:07.630> and<00:06:07.900> even<00:06:08.320> if

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
your humongous graphics card and even if

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.290 
your humongous graphics card and even if
you<00:06:08.560> were<00:06:08.650> to<00:06:08.680> add<00:06:08.889> on<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.310> future<00:06:09.580> water<00:06:09.910> cooler

this<00:06:10.479> will<00:06:10.690> hold<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:11.020> too<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.560> this<00:06:12.250> just

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
this will hold that too and this just

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.790 
this will hold that too and this just
looks<00:06:12.700> really<00:06:13.330> nice<00:06:13.479> for<00:06:13.930> a<00:06:13.960> case<00:06:14.289> not<00:06:14.650> to

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
looks really nice for a case not to

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.940 
looks really nice for a case not to
mention<00:06:14.979> that<00:06:15.789> this<00:06:16.060> also<00:06:16.300> lights<00:06:16.690> up<00:06:16.960> so<00:06:17.229> this

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
mention that this also lights up so this

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.040 
mention that this also lights up so this
just<00:06:18.160> looks<00:06:18.400> eight<00:06:18.610> this<00:06:19.060> looks<00:06:19.389> just<00:06:19.810> looks
