might be bats that's right and then the
yellow<00:01:26.820> circles<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.540> supposing<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.439> either

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
yellow circles I'm supposing are either

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
yellow circles I'm supposing are either
pumpkins<00:01:29.630> because<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:30.900> look

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
pumpkins because they don't look

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.319 
pumpkins because they don't look
completely<00:01:31.470> orange<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.970> might<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
completely orange or they might be a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.710 
completely orange or they might be a
moon<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.770> those<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.009> pumpkins<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:35.939> moons<00:01:36.360> I'm

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
moon so those are pumpkins or moons I'm

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920
