00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

all<00:00:00.630> right<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:00.960> now<00:00:01.079> I've<00:00:01.469> shown<00:00:01.770> everything

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
all right so now I've shown everything

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.610 
all right so now I've shown everything
as<00:00:03.149> far<00:00:03.360> as<00:00:03.419> you<00:00:03.629> know<00:00:03.720> two<00:00:03.870> point<00:00:04.110> three<00:00:04.319> point

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
as far as you know two point three point

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.740 
as far as you know two point three point
but<00:00:05.100> I'm<00:00:05.190> not<00:00:05.310> sure<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> draw<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.629> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
but I'm not sure how to draw in a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.120 
but I'm not sure how to draw in a
symmetrical<00:00:07.259> box<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.830> really

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
symmetrical box and this is really

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.220 
symmetrical box and this is really
simple<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.700> sort<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.690> um<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:11.750> nice<00:00:12.750> met<00:00:13.019> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
simple this is sort of um a nice met a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.959 
simple this is sort of um a nice met a
symmetrical<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.920> more<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> show

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
symmetrical is more of like how to show

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.359 
symmetrical is more of like how to show
a<00:00:15.299> sense<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.109> real<00:00:16.379> scale<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.070> everything

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
a sense of real scale because everything

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.760 
a sense of real scale because everything
I'm<00:00:17.460> drawing<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.880> kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> small<00:00:19.560> but

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
I'm drawing is kind of kind of small but

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.260 
I'm drawing is kind of kind of small but
if<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.369> were<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> actually<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:20.970> something

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
if you were to actually see something

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.640 
if you were to actually see something
that<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.600> would<00:00:21.720> draw<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.109> real<00:00:22.590> life

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that what you would draw it in real life

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.460 
that what you would draw it in real life
you<00:00:23.189> would<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.810> vanishing

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you would have you know the vanishing

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
you would have you know the vanishing
points<00:00:25.710> would<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:26.279> way<00:00:26.670> way<00:00:26.880> far<00:00:27.180> off<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
points would be way way way far off the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.900 
points would be way way way far off the
paper<00:00:27.630> summit<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> most<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> stuff<00:00:29.880> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
paper summit so most of the stuff you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.580 
paper summit so most of the stuff you
can<00:00:30.150> almost<00:00:30.300> draw<00:00:30.599> asymmetrically<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.439> you're

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
can almost draw asymmetrically if you're

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.680 
can almost draw asymmetrically if you're
trying<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> draw<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.219> an<00:00:32.340> accurate<00:00:32.669> box<00:00:32.880> so

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
trying to draw like an accurate box so

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.190 
trying to draw like an accurate box so
I'm<00:00:34.320> gonna<00:00:34.469> show<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> how<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> draw<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.569 

alright<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:40.800> gonna<00:00:40.920> pick<00:00:41.100> any<00:00:41.250> vantage

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
alright I'm not gonna pick any vantage

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
alright I'm not gonna pick any vantage
points<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.030> horizon<00:00:42.480> line<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.870> I'm

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
points or horizon line for this one I'm

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.209 
points or horizon line for this one I'm
just<00:00:43.860> gonna<00:00:44.070> start<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> point<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
just gonna start with a point and

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
just gonna start with a point and
aligned<00:00:47.750> going<00:00:48.750> straight<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:51.320> any<00:00:52.320> symmetric

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
aligned going straight up any symmetric

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.610 
aligned going straight up any symmetric
means<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.090> lines<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.050> away

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
means that the lines that are going away

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.709 
means that the lines that are going away
from<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> paper<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.390> vanishing

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from the paper like where your vanishing

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
from the paper like where your vanishing
points<00:00:58.079> would<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.969> non-existent<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
points would be are non-existent and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.090 
points would be are non-existent and
they're<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.230> basically<00:01:02.059> basically

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
they're just basically basically

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.609 
they're just basically basically
perpendicular<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.760> we're<00:01:06.659> gonna<00:01:06.810> take<00:01:07.229> two

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
perpendicular so we're gonna take two

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
perpendicular so we're gonna take two
perpendicular<00:01:08.130> lines<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
perpendicular lines going this way and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.940 
perpendicular lines going this way and
that<00:01:09.570> way<00:01:09.990> we'll<00:01:10.799> start<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.250> way<00:01:11.400> first

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.109 

it's<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:19.010> good<00:01:19.130> thing<00:01:19.340> since<00:01:19.670> we're<00:01:19.850> trying<00:01:20.000> to

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
it's a good thing since we're trying to

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.580 
it's a good thing since we're trying to
keep<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.360> asymmetrical<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.290> means<00:01:21.440> this

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
keep it asymmetrical so that means this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.859 
keep it asymmetrical so that means this
line<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:22.070> basically<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.760> have<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.450> go<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:23.690> here

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
line is basically I have to go up here

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:24.969 
line is basically I have to go up here
so<00:01:24.049> it's<00:01:24.200> good<00:01:24.320> thing<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.500> just<00:01:24.650> kind<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:24.830> keep

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
so it's good thing you just kind of keep

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.530 
so it's good thing you just kind of keep
straight<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.490> just<00:01:25.610> eyeball<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.180> look<00:01:26.360> at

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
straight and just eyeball it and look at

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.480 
straight and just eyeball it and look at
it<00:01:26.659> there's<00:01:27.110> there's<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.590> official<00:01:28.190> way<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.340> do

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
it there's there's a official way to do

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.490 
it there's there's a official way to do
it<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.790> takes<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.119> lot<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.299> time<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:29.810> this

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
it but it takes a lot of time so this

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.190 
it but it takes a lot of time so this
way<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.710> mean<00:01:31.300> trust<00:01:32.300> your<00:01:32.479> eyes<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.810> guys<00:01:32.960> are

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
way I mean trust your eyes you guys are

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.420 
way I mean trust your eyes you guys are
usually<00:01:33.290> right<00:01:33.649> you<00:01:33.830> mean<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.070> can<00:01:34.250> measure

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
usually right you mean you can measure

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.570 
usually right you mean you can measure
it<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.790> want<00:01:35.000> up<00:01:35.360> here<00:01:35.659> but<00:01:36.159> you<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:37.399> do

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
it if you want up here but you just do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.340 
it if you want up here but you just do
it<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:37.759> way<00:01:38.799> no<00:01:40.030> so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
it this way no so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:53.529 
it this way no so
and<00:01:42.350> let's<00:01:42.979> do<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.159> over<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.270> side<00:01:52.539> and

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
and let's do it over on the side and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.919 
and let's do it over on the side and
just<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.229> we<00:01:54.409> would<00:01:54.500> with<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.710> parallel<00:01:55.100> line

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
just like we would with a parallel line

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:07.149 
just like we would with a parallel line
pick<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.050> corner<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.679> box<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.920> now

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
pick the corner of the box and so now

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.370 
pick the corner of the box and so now
the<00:02:07.520> only<00:02:07.700> like<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.600> two<00:02:08.690> point<00:02:08.899> respected

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the only like and two point respected

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.970 
the only like and two point respected
are<00:02:09.619> these<00:02:10.280> lines<00:02:10.580> from<00:02:11.390> parallel<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.709> these

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
are these lines from parallel all these

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.470 
are these lines from parallel all these
lines<00:02:13.190> also<00:02:13.400> run<00:02:13.700> parallel<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.209> that's<00:02:14.360> how

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
lines also run parallel and that's how

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.470 
lines also run parallel and that's how
we<00:02:14.540> call<00:02:14.720> an<00:02:14.840> asymmetrical
