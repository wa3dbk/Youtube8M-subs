00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
because we have a really large

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.669 
because we have a really large
department<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:12.210> gathers<00:00:12.690> all<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.469> good

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
researchers in the field in the same

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.720 
researchers in the field in the same
place<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.710> sort<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.070> central<00:00:17.430> place

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
place and it's sort of a central place

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.769

for<00:00:17.760> classics<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:19.170> Europe<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.689> you

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
for classics in Europe I think so you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.810 
for classics in Europe I think so you
don't<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.529> travel<00:00:23.430> very<00:00:23.519> far

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
interesting because apparently the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.699 
interesting because apparently the
Oxford<00:03:09.100> classics<00:03:09.820> degree<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.440> the
