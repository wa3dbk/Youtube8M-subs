00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you have a bunch of levels in so it's

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.589

so basically you got these go balls down
here<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.909> gotta<00:02:27.120> use<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.780> glue<00:02:28.049> balls

tower here I've done that better also

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
tower here I've done that better also
here<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.359> sucks<00:02:48.659> them<00:02:48.780> up<00:02:48.870> into<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.260> pipe<00:02:49.530> it

here it sucks them up into the pipe it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640 
here it sucks them up into the pipe it
builds<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.849> up<00:02:50.879> here<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:52.019> continue<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.530> can

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
level you have to build a bridge across

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.020 
level you have to build a bridge across

and also includes a new element which is
the<00:03:21.359> element<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.079> balloons<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.269> basically

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
the element of balloons and basically

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.729 
the element of balloons and basically
here<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.769> can<00:03:25.889> zoom<00:03:25.919> in<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:26.280> two<00:03:26.430> fingers<00:03:27.739> you

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
here we can zoom in with two fingers you

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.140 
here we can zoom in with two fingers you
take<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.069> little<00:03:29.190> blue<00:03:29.400> balls<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:29.940> build

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
take the little blue balls and you build

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.990 
take the little blue balls and you build
a<00:03:30.269> bridge<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:32.340> gotta<00:03:32.489> use<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.669> blues

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
a bridge and you gotta use the blues

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.210 
a bridge and you gotta use the blues
keep<00:03:33.389> up<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.569> bridge<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.109> doesn't<00:03:34.410> hit<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
keep up the bridge so it doesn't hit the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.979 
keep up the bridge so it doesn't hit the
spikes<00:03:35.549> down<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.269> then<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:36.660> can't<00:03:36.840> use

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
spikes down here and then you can't use

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.210 
spikes down here and then you can't use
too<00:03:37.139> many<00:03:37.260> balloons<00:03:37.560> because<00:03:37.709> then<00:03:37.919> i'll<00:03:38.040> hit

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
too many balloons because then i'll hit

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.240 
too many balloons because then i'll hit
the<00:03:38.340> spikes<00:03:38.579> up<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.620> quite<00:03:40.919> simple

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the spikes up there so it's quite simple

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.809 
the spikes up there so it's quite simple
but<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.639> also<00:03:41.760> hard<00:03:42.480> at<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.750> same<00:03:42.989> time<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.790> I

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
but it's also hard at the same time so I

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.400 
but it's also hard at the same time so I
just<00:03:45.060> grabbed<00:03:45.269> balloon<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.959> can<00:03:49.109> tell<00:03:49.290> the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
alright so this is this is actually a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.580 
alright so this is this is actually a
great<00:04:55.100> example<00:04:55.990> which<00:04:56.990> also<00:04:57.170> uses<00:04:57.410> the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
great example which also uses the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.510 
great example which also uses the
balloons<00:04:58.180> we<00:04:59.180> gotta<00:04:59.330> stick<00:04:59.540> these<00:04:59.690> balloons

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
could have made it up there so then we

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.950 
could have made it up there so then we
pass<00:07:00.910> the<00:07:01.090> level<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:01.480> now<00:07:01.540> we<00:07:01.600> got<00:07:01.780> two

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
pass the level and now we got two

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.780 
pass the level and now we got two
blenders<00:07:02.230> and<00:07:02.740> just<00:07:03.280> keeps<00:07:03.430> going<00:07:03.580> like<00:07:03.730> that

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790 
blenders and just keeps going like that

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.980 
blenders and just keeps going like that
and<00:07:04.030> it<00:07:04.090> gets<00:07:04.210> harder<00:07:04.660> as<00:07:04.780> the<00:07:04.810> game

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
and it gets harder as the game

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.680 
and it gets harder as the game
progresses<00:07:05.410> very<00:07:05.919> simple<00:07:06.310> but<00:07:07.300> that's<00:07:07.450> it<00:07:07.570> you

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690
