of her time and made their work you know
I<00:00:41.330> don't<00:00:41.510> think<00:00:41.540> you<00:00:41.720> can<00:00:41.900> see<00:00:42.199> she<00:00:42.410> was

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
copying them appropriating them I think

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.500 
copying them appropriating them I think
the<00:00:45.800> best<00:00:46.040> way<00:00:46.309> to<00:00:46.339> describe<00:00:46.879> what<00:00:47.239> she<00:00:47.269> was

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.079 
the best way to describe what she was
doing<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:48.769> say<00:00:49.010> she<00:00:49.250> was<00:00:49.400> making<00:00:49.640> other

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089
