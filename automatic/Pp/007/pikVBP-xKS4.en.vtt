this tip is about snipers so let's say

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.830 
this tip is about snipers so let's say
you<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.480> sniper<00:00:19.070> right<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.250> guy<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
you have a sniper right this guy and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.870 
you have a sniper right this guy and
your<00:00:21.840> enemy<00:00:22.170> most<00:00:22.410> likely<00:00:22.769> also<00:00:23.189> has<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
your enemy most likely also has one and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.080 
your enemy most likely also has one and
you<00:00:24.510> need<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> attack<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.230> area<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:27.060> need

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
you need to attack an area if you need

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.120 
you need to attack an area if you need
to<00:00:27.420> do<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.830> hide<00:00:29.099> your

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
to do all that then you can hide your

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
to do all that then you can hide your
sniper<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.029> doesn't<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.330> counter<00:00:30.779> snipers

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
sniper so it doesn't get counter snipers

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.310 
sniper so it doesn't get counter snipers
by<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> enemy<00:00:31.920> sniper<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.020> do

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
by the enemy sniper and the way you do

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.970 
by the enemy sniper and the way you do
this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.739> clump<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.790> infantry<00:00:36.980> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this is clump up all your infantry so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.569 
this is clump up all your infantry so
that<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.489> surrounding<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> sniper

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
that if they are surrounding the sniper

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.010 
that if they are surrounding the sniper
I'll<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:41.940> fear<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.719> really

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I'll put some fear you want to be really

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.500 
I'll put some fear you want to be really
you<00:00:43.860> want<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.550> close

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.209 

something<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.890> hard<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
something like that so that it's hard to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
something like that so that it's hard to
select<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.969> sniper<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
select your sniper as you can see I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.720 
select your sniper as you can see I
can't<00:00:53.190> even<00:00:53.250> select<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> without<00:00:54.180> doing<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
can't even select it without doing that

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
can't even select it without doing that
now<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.879> makes<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> hard<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> enemy<00:00:57.949> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
now this makes it hard for the enemy to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
now this makes it hard for the enemy to
select<00:00:59.399> his<00:00:59.579> sniper<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.390> right-click

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
select his sniper and then right-click

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
select his sniper and then right-click
on<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:00.960> sniper<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:03.329> he<00:01:03.510> can't

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
on your sniper so if he can't

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
on your sniper so if he can't
right-click<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.379> sniper<00:01:04.650> he<00:01:05.040> can't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
right-click on your sniper he can't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
right-click on your sniper he can't
counter<00:01:05.670> snipe<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:07.220> unless<00:01:08.220> his<00:01:08.400> sniper<00:01:09.060> just

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
counter snipe you unless his sniper just

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.600 
counter snipe you unless his sniper just
gets<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> lucky<00:01:09.689> shot

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
gets a lucky shot

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.630 
gets a lucky shot
so<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> will<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.030> helpful<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:13.490> hiding<00:01:14.490> your

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so this will be helpful in hiding your

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
so this will be helpful in hiding your
sniper<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.180> doesn't<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.450> counter<00:01:15.750> sniped<00:01:15.960> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
sniper so doesn't get counter sniped but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.420 
sniper so doesn't get counter sniped but
this<00:01:16.380> also<00:01:16.560> makes<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> hard<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
this also makes it hard for you to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.060 
this also makes it hard for you to
select<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:17.909> sniper<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.770> way<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.979> you
