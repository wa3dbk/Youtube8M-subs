a medium sized just him but the rest of
them<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.870> pretty<00:00:55.079> much<00:00:55.289> almost<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> same

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
them are pretty much almost the same

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.660 
them are pretty much almost the same
size<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> wanted<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> start<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.079> tank<00:00:58.320> young

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
size so I wanted to start to tank young

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
size so I wanted to start to tank young
also<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.940> grow<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.359> each<00:01:00.600> other<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
also they can grow into each other and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
also they can grow into each other and
you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.219> used<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> each<00:01:02.670> other<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you know be used to each other by the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
you know be used to each other by the
time<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.840> big<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.110> hopefully<00:01:05.010> their

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
time they get big and hopefully their

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.770 
time they get big and hopefully their
attitudes<00:01:05.970> won't<00:01:06.210> change<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.030> since<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
attitudes won't change and since then I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
attitudes won't change and since then I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tank and the w XM was actually able to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.630 
tank and the w XM was actually able to

link up with the MP 10 so I'm running

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
link up with the MP 10 so I'm running
about<00:01:48.000> eight<00:01:48.990> different<00:01:49.380> settings

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
about eight different settings

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.510 
about eight different settings
throughout<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> days<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.310> with<00:01:53.310> different

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
throughout the days and with different

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.109 
throughout the days and with different
intensity<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:55.189> what's<00:01:56.189> good<00:01:56.430> about<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
intensity and what's good about it is it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.870 
intensity and what's good about it is it
gives<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:57.570> random<00:01:58.200> flow<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.950> since

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
gives me way more random flow and since

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240 
gives me way more random flow and since
it's<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> small<00:02:00.390> tank<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.740> high<00:02:01.920> flow

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it's a small tank you know the high flow

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.450 
it's a small tank you know the high flow
is<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.759> spinning<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> circle

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
is just not spinning them in a circle

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
is just not spinning them in a circle
it's<00:02:05.460> actually<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.649> giving<00:02:07.649> them

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's actually you know giving them

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.999 
it's actually you know giving them
different<00:02:08.160> strengths<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.750> far<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.289> lagoon<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
swimming leg up towards the fan as you

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.540 
swimming leg up towards the fan as you
can<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.330> kind<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.690> weather<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:20.050> now<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.340> I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
can see kind of weather at now but I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.950 
can see kind of weather at now but I
think<00:02:21.700> they're<00:02:22.030> looking<00:02:22.300> around<00:02:22.480> for<00:02:22.720> food

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
think they're looking around for food

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.680 
think they're looking around for food
because<00:02:23.380> I'm<00:02:23.530> near<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.830> tank<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:27.480> what's<00:02:28.480> nice

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
because I'm near to tank but what's nice

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.100 
because I'm near to tank but what's nice
about<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.200> w<00:02:29.470> XM<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.660> set<00:02:31.930> all

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
about the w XM is that you can set all

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.230 
about the w XM is that you can set all
kinds<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.560> settings<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:34.030> never

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
kinds of settings to this and you never

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.540 
kinds of settings to this and you never
have<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.540> touch<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.800> turn<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.890> off<00:02:35.950> turn<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.340> on

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
have to touch it turn it off turn it on

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.930 
have to touch it turn it off turn it on
I<00:02:36.880> got<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.240> night<00:02:37.420> mode<00:02:37.660> set<00:02:37.990> for<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.940> also

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
I got a night mode set for it and also

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.500 
I got a night mode set for it and also
since<00:02:40.930> i'm<00:02:41.080> talking<00:02:41.410> about<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.709> Neptune<00:02:42.130> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
since i'm talking about the Neptune I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.540 
since i'm talking about the Neptune I
did<00:02:43.510> place<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.290> next<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> temperature

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
did place this next to the temperature

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.720 
did place this next to the temperature
probe<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.870> figure<00:02:47.440> out<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.070> was<00:02:48.280> accurate

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
probe to figure out if this was accurate

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.270 
probe to figure out if this was accurate
or<00:02:48.880> not<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.959> thermometer<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.830> actually

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
or not this thermometer is actually

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.030 
or not this thermometer is actually
inaccurate<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.600> core<00:02:52.810> life<00:02:53.080> it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
inaccurate it's a core life it's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.100 
inaccurate it's a core life it's
actually<00:02:54.459> two<00:02:54.670> degrees<00:02:55.030> higher<00:02:55.450> than<00:02:55.810> what

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
actually two degrees higher than what

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.340 
actually two degrees higher than what
the<00:02:56.200> water<00:02:56.410> actually<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.090> got<00:02:58.330> at<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> 79

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
the water actually is so I got at the 79

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.610 
the water actually is so I got at the 79
which<00:02:59.950> keeps<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> tank<00:03:00.700> at<00:03:00.850> 77<00:03:01.600> which<00:03:02.470> is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
which keeps the tank at 77 which is

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.340 
which keeps the tank at 77 which is
ideal<00:03:02.830> temperature<00:03:03.459> for<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.700> reef<00:03:03.910> tank<00:03:04.350> most

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
ideal temperature for a reef tank most

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.050 
ideal temperature for a reef tank most
people<00:03:05.650> would<00:03:05.800> say<00:03:05.950> 78<00:03:06.580> but<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.120> preferred<00:03:07.600> 77<00:03:08.350> I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
people would say 78 but I preferred 77 I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.590 
people would say 78 but I preferred 77 I
also<00:03:10.060> added<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.840> red<00:03:11.140> scarlet<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.270> can<00:03:13.420> see

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
also added a red scarlet if you can see

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.009 
also added a red scarlet if you can see
his<00:03:13.720> legs<00:03:14.050> know<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:14.739> he's<00:03:14.890> coming<00:03:14.920> up<00:03:15.340> not<00:03:15.700> but

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
his legs know if he's coming up not but

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.360 
his legs know if he's coming up not but
he's<00:03:17.019> probably<00:03:17.230> hiding<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:17.860> I'm<00:03:18.040> coming

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
he's probably hiding because I'm coming

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.090 
he's probably hiding because I'm coming
near<00:03:18.549> him<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:20.260> everything<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.650> doing<00:03:20.830> good<00:03:21.010> in

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
near him but everything is doing good in

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.100 
near him but everything is doing good in
this<00:03:21.190> tank<00:03:21.459> pH<00:03:22.150> has<00:03:22.390> been<00:03:22.570> nice<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.900> stable

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
this tank pH has been nice and stable

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.509 
this tank pH has been nice and stable
and<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:25.049> would<00:03:26.049> have<00:03:26.200> something<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.650> do<00:03:26.830> with

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
and that would have something to do with

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.020 
and that would have something to do with
the<00:03:27.730> Shadle<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.660> add<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.140> back<00:03:29.320> I

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
the Shadle that I add it in the back I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.670 
the Shadle that I add it in the back I
put<00:03:31.030> about<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.209> quarter<00:03:31.570> pound<00:03:31.780> ball<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.500> look

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
put about a quarter pound ball you look

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.759 
put about a quarter pound ball you look
a<00:03:32.709> baseball-sized<00:03:33.900> blob<00:03:34.900> shadle<00:03:35.350> back<00:03:35.500> there

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
a baseball-sized blob shadle back there

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.979 
a baseball-sized blob shadle back there
and<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.549> keep<00:03:36.730> this<00:03:36.910> refugium<00:03:37.450> light<00:03:37.690> running

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
and I keep this refugium light running

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.310 
and I keep this refugium light running
24<00:03:38.590> hours<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:40.299> been<00:03:40.510> pretty<00:03:40.750> stable<00:03:41.019> as

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
24 hours and it's been pretty stable as

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.770 
24 hours and it's been pretty stable as
far<00:03:41.530> as<00:03:41.620> pH<00:03:41.950> goals<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.150> did<00:03:43.390> add<00:03:43.570> those

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
far as pH goals and I did add those

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.680 
far as pH goals and I did add those
black<00:03:44.049> pieces<00:03:44.549> around<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.480> block

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
black pieces around it just to block

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.660 
black pieces around it just to block
some<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.140> light<00:03:47.320> from<00:03:47.530> escaping<00:03:47.709> out<00:03:48.250> from

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
some of the light from escaping out from

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.170 
some of the light from escaping out from
this<00:03:48.790> overflow<00:03:50.519> since<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.579> did<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.940> it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
this overflow since I did that it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.060 
this overflow since I did that it
actually<00:03:52.360> gives<00:03:52.690> them<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.989> nice<00:03:53.170> little

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
actually gives them a nice little

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.759 
actually gives them a nice little
moonlight<00:03:54.730> coming<00:03:55.480> down<00:03:55.630> from<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.650> when

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
moonlight coming down from here so when

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.340 
moonlight coming down from here so when
the<00:03:56.890> lights<00:03:57.070> are<00:03:57.250> off<00:03:57.310> at<00:03:57.670> night<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.959> fish<00:03:59.170> get

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
the lights are off at night the fish get

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.199 
the lights are off at night the fish get
a<00:03:59.410> little<00:03:59.620> bit<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.860> moonlight<00:04:00.310> which<00:04:01.060> is

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
a little bit of a moonlight which is

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.990 
a little bit of a moonlight which is
pretty<00:04:01.360> nice<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.010> since<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.640> added<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
pretty nice and since I added the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.780 
pretty nice and since I added the
softies<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.959> also<00:04:05.440> went<00:04:05.739> ahead<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.220> added<00:04:06.610> some

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
softies I also went ahead and added some

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.670 
softies I also went ahead and added some
timers<00:04:07.799> just<00:04:08.799> so<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.610> know<00:04:09.640> they're<00:04:10.530> stick<00:04:11.530> to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
timers just so you know they're stick to

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.140 
timers just so you know they're stick to
a<00:04:11.709> schedule<00:04:12.010> as<00:04:12.340> far<00:04:12.549> as<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.760> lighting<00:04:13.060> is

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
a schedule as far as the lighting is

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.550 
a schedule as far as the lighting is
concerned<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.690> know<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.959> made<00:04:14.110> a<00:04:14.140> little<00:04:14.350> reef

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
concerned I know it made a little reef

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.599 
concerned I know it made a little reef
you<00:04:15.070> know<00:04:15.660> octopus<00:04:16.660> mess<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:18.280> everybody

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
you know octopus mess that everybody
