00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.159
 frau 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.169

 first thing 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.810
 it is severe 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.810
 wanting a little to be desired 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 the group of pepper and each one 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 even with everyone 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.690
 I identify myself 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.050
 if I have no doubt 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.880
 the majority belonged to dialing 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.230
 but - should be kept to a minimum 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.940
 so senator 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.940

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 guilherme leme 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 I do not care 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.650
 the descendants are like this 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.800
 picks up pretty good 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 she 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.080
 I'll leave 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.800
 sitting in the environment 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.990
 the thymus 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.040
 in seven of them 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
 the international jokes 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.069
 I really do not know Bethlehem always. 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.449
 only 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:25.879
 I did it 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.060
 not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.060
 bush 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.279
 bush 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.279
 we 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.989
 not 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.779
 it is 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.559
 Earth 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.879
 6 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 O 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.169
 now it goes well 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 international 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.279
 made 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.989
 not 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.989
 we 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.039
 he until now 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.039
 in the afternoon 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.479
 but is like that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.400
 they now have the minutes 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.030
 It is a very dynamic day and night. 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.400
 because I think it complements that ball but they think that you are not 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.699
 to like 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.699
 How does she have no chance? 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.479

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.699
 rodrigo maya rj 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.699
 however it still shows a little of itself but then 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 working from the distributed document 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.520

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.139

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.409
 this image 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.460
 elaborated now 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.180
 at the same pace moonwalk 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.259
 I'm but the ball stayed for me 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.229
 richard wrangham 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.110
