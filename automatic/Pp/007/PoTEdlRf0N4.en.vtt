little bit about the game mechanics and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.830 
little bit about the game mechanics and
kind<00:00:21.540> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> look<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.930> feel<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.290> game<00:00:23.840> so

we're going to start off here this is
the<00:00:27.180> first<00:00:27.390> puzzle<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:28.080> see<00:00:28.230> there's<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the first puzzle you can see there's a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
the first puzzle you can see there's a
whole<00:00:28.680> sign<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> background<00:00:29.550> I'll<00:00:30.270> toss

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
whole sign in the background I'll toss

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
whole sign in the background I'll toss
out<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:30.780> punch<00:00:31.260> jelly<00:00:31.560> bean<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.369> blob

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
out my punch jelly bean and the blob

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.890 
out my punch jelly bean and the blob
transforms<00:00:33.059> into<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> hole<00:00:33.449> and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.629> can<00:00:33.780> go

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
transforms into a hole and I can go

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.340 
transforms into a hole and I can go
right<00:00:34.050> through<00:00:35.270> wow<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> love<00:00:36.629> you<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> town<00:00:37.080> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in the Far background a lot of these

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.120 
in the Far background a lot of these
trees<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:45.270> move<00:00:45.420> back<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.810> forth<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:47.070> a

trees will move back and forth there's a

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.670 
trees will move back and forth there's a
lot<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> their<00:00:48.239> 3d<00:00:48.630> elements<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
lot of their 3d elements but it's all in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430 
lot of their 3d elements but it's all in
this<00:00:49.770> 2d<00:00:50.130> world<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:52.020> know<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.260> kept

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
this 2d world so you know we kept

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.549 
this 2d world so you know we kept
everything<00:00:52.710> very<00:00:53.460> 2d<00:00:53.880> but<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.989> embracing<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
everything very 2d but it's embracing a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
everything very 2d but it's embracing a
lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> new<00:00:55.890> technology<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.630> see<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> signs

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
lot of new technology so I see the signs

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.510 
lot of new technology so I see the signs
in<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.440> background<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.160> leading

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
in the background are kind of leading

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
in the background are kind of leading
you<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.680> show<00:01:02.040> off<00:01:02.160> with

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you to you know do what show off with

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
you to you know do what show off with
the<00:01:02.399> blob<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.790> do<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.059> he<00:01:03.090> eats<00:01:03.300> his<00:01:03.450> jelly

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the blob can do as he eats his jelly

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
the blob can do as he eats his jelly
beans<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.410> right<00:01:04.710> yeah<00:01:05.070> early<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.520> in<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
beans that's right yeah early on in the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760 
beans that's right yeah early on in the
game<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.300> lot<00:01:06.509> of<00:01:06.539> these<00:01:06.720> signs<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
game we have a lot of these signs one of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.080 
game we have a lot of these signs one of
the<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:08.039> things<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.490> wanted<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.789> do<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the big things that we wanted to do in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.340 
the big things that we wanted to do in
this<00:01:09.180> game<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.539> eliminate<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.050> lot<00:01:10.289> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this game was eliminate a lot of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
this game was eliminate a lot of
extraneous<00:01:10.950> interface<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.030> text<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
extraneous interface and text from the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
extraneous interface and text from the
game<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.920> won't<00:01:14.190> see<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> text

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
game so you won't see a lot of text

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.320 
game so you won't see a lot of text
tutorials<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.670> just<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> cumbersome

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
tutorials or just kind of cumbersome

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.230 
tutorials or just kind of cumbersome
menu<00:01:18.690> elements<00:01:19.369> one<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> compromises<00:01:21.119> we

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
menu elements one of the compromises we

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
menu elements one of the compromises we
did<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> create<00:01:21.869> these<00:01:22.140> signs<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.369> here

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
did was to create these signs so here

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
did was to create these signs so here
you'll<00:01:23.760> see<00:01:23.820> an<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.150> arrow<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> I'll<00:01:25.560> take

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you'll see an up arrow and I'll take

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
you'll see an up arrow and I'll take
that<00:01:26.070> advice<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that advice and go up here and a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
that advice and go up here and a
treasure<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.619> my<00:01:28.860> reward<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.060> know

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
treasure will be my reward but you know

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.090 
treasure will be my reward but you know
they're<00:01:30.630> taper<00:01:30.840> off<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.080> lot<00:01:31.380> later<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.010> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they're taper off a lot later on in the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
they're taper off a lot later on in the
game<00:01:32.130> seems<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.299> bit<00:01:33.450> more

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
game seems I could be a little bit more

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
game seems I could be a little bit more
immersive<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.189> text

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
immersive that way to not have text

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
immersive that way to not have text
popping<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.510> every<00:01:36.750> 10<00:01:36.900> seconds<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
popping up every 10 seconds that's the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.300 
popping up every 10 seconds that's the
idea<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> I've<00:01:41.009> come<00:01:41.280> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
idea so you see now that I've come up

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
idea so you see now that I've come up
here<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> treasure<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.110> in

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
here I can get this treasure and just in
