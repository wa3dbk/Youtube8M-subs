chimney or whatever it is and then aim
for<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.909> edge<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.720> window<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:24.070> go<00:01:24.280> up<00:01:24.490> on

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
for the edge of the window and go up on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:38.370 
for the edge of the window and go up on
the<00:01:25.950> wire<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.710> guy<00:01:32.860> inside<00:01:33.310> is

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:51.029 

now<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.439> parser<00:01:40.429> version<00:01:46.359> is<00:01:48.579> more<00:01:49.579> simple

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
now the parser version is more simple

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.300 
now the parser version is more simple
than<00:01:52.039> icon<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.899> next<00:01:54.229> one<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.679> going<00:01:55.189> to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
than icon and the next one is going to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.490 
than icon and the next one is going to
be<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.359> same<00:01:57.729> like<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.090> first<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.990> go<00:02:00.140> through

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
be the same like the first we go through

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.690 
be the same like the first we go through
all<00:02:01.689> align<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:03.369> whole<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.700> chimney<00:02:06.700> and

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
all align this whole and chimney and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.050 
all align this whole and chimney and
then<00:02:08.390> not<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:10.250> go<00:02:10.690> on<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.810> rooftop<00:02:13.060> in

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
then not here you go on the rooftop in

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.930 
then not here you go on the rooftop in
the<00:02:14.120> end<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> row<00:02:15.049> top<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.760> go

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the end of the row top here and it go

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.850 
the end of the row top here and it go
down<00:02:17.829> hold<00:02:18.829> it<00:02:18.970> for<00:02:19.970> crosshair<00:02:20.480> okay<00:02:20.989> not<00:02:21.590> on

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
down hold it for crosshair okay not on

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.809 
down hold it for crosshair okay not on
it

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
it

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:37.479 
it
I<00:02:22.849> look<00:02:23.690> down<00:02:23.989> touching

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:50.050 

and<00:02:38.900> conservation<00:02:42.379> make<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.409> catch<00:02:44.269> here<00:02:47.900> here

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
and conservation make a catch here here

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.550 
and conservation make a catch here here
and<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> second<00:02:51.540> flaw

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
