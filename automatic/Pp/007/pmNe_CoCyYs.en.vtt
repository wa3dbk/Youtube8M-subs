00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.440
 red he was receiving the mios guy from epinal 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.240

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 best moments of the meeting in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.350
 imagery 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
 nineteen to ten it was the combined score 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.439
 last three meetings between the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 two formations and yet it will take 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.130
 wait late in the first third for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 see the red devils open the mark 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.960
 on this launch coming from the deviated blue 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.580
 by jimmie johnson in front of the slot 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 of andré ge rise var it is 1 0 for 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.300
 the red devils that go back to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 locker rooms with this second advance 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.340
 third and the truck that will push this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.870
 superb stoppage of the match for mado 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 laura who will launch his leggings for 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.129
 stop this palace and then behind and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 well brian will double the bet on this 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.670
 mcdonald's throw there's dave 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.090
 labrecque who hang around the corner and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.360
 that's 2 0 2 0 for briançon who at this 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.980
 moment there makes a break that they will keep 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.629
 until the end of the match even if they do not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.250
 do not know yet it's not fault for 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.110
 the game you're trying to pick up at 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 score first on this action is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 in shot number 3 b returns to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.890
 contact of madaule will have the porter of the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 devils 16 defend my from their achievements 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 a few minutes later will be once 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 further requested by the troop to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.049
 philippe bozon 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.060
 this time it's on this swept toss 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.400
 that it is the transverse of the cerberus 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 briançonnais who will save the guardian of the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.540
 aim of laura who without point on this 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 third third harpooning once from 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.280
 more and who would be elected mvp of this 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.590
 meets logically laundering for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.420
 the goalkeeper briançonnais victory 2 to 0 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.180
 men from both terglav for the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 last home encounter this 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.790
 season everything if we find the coach at 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.790
 micro of the post match 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.080
 defensive game galy match today 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.480
 it's been a few games but as long as we 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.160
 talk about being better on the ground 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.240
 we need to be more than a team of 20 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.070
 in a defensive 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.030
 I intend to pocket one too because 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.410
 they work hard all season 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.340
 then it's the town hall 10 launderings 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.450
 if there are things that do not work at 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.130
 beginning of the year but today we 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.480
 see we throw a lot more we put 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.040
 much more talked about the cage did 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680
 many difficulties the Gazette 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.820
 opponents this is what we ask for 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 look at things more simply I 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.440
 finds that we progress a lot then 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.220
 would also do the other side of the benefits 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.900
 digital 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.840
 if we did a great job today 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.580
 defender the attackers really have 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.740
 hasten their efforts paid the price we have 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.050
 blocked shooting it's his real face of 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.870
 blue or we gave a few days to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.640
 auspicious leave for you to really 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.459
 now rest physically too 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.820
 then when we come back after the line of 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.540
 really get ready for the last one the 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.830
 last is not in season we will take 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 there are two games where after a game 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.250
 both not looking too much 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.709
 ranking that can happen we're going 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.850
 prepare as much as possible for wheat whatever 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.890
 it happens we are in the final and that in 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.269
 the first 4 or not hinse worked 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.180
 quite rightly tonight especially in 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.380
 the bands know a lot rubbed 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.140
 physically the end of the match right there 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.300
 how do you feel there is 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.280
 tired necessarily especially after the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.709
 long wait we've never had 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.950
 so much time in a cloakroom nothing 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.530
 do but uh nan but that's it is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.820
 tired we get hurt but as we have 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.680
 earned what we wanted before 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.290
 holidays especially I think to do some 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.380
 well head to leave each left 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.700
 to the right besides brian and 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.770
 do something else with 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 a feeling of victory over the last 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.620
 match how you felt 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.040
 collectively the things that come 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.239
 that's fine 2 0 I did not think 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.920
 redo but I recognize I will remember 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.569
 especially the fact that we did not cash 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.360
 of purpose next to that since the beginning of 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.720
 season good part of people I think about 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.610
 outside brian can matter does not see 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.900
 not necessarily like a team like a 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.940
 welded collective that is capable of 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.500
 to win 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.860
 I personally have no doubt 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.900
 a single second if you had seen the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.459
 in quotation marks galley that we lived in 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.549
 go to vaujany for over a month 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.010
 things like that in the locker room 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.870
 has always gone well except that it is 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.220
 on that behind on the ice it's not 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.450
 always easy to win we do not have 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.280
 always won we went to 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.109
 through 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.030
 it was not at all well if a fault 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.510
 professional as against against 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.169
 strasbourg 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.280
 but I think these defeats there 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.800
 also allows a group to forge 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.440
 is precisely to pull himself up 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.180
 to go as far as possible 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.550
 and on the side of philippe bozon the coach of 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.010
 epinal game you day was hard 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.810
 already bus trouble to get to 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.400
 brian and then the defeat 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.229
 listen to what he has to tell us philippe 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 to start what happened 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.930
 exactly for you it was not 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.930
 simple tonight with the bus I believe 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.420
 good galley day as we call it 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.400
 left at 8 o'clock this morning 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:07.520
 arrived at 8:30 20:45 here we all who we 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.760
 could have an accident on the road 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.100
 a plug of plugs and then the bus 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.290
 after that which has broken down so 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.660
 that's part of the ups and downs but 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.400
 I would not look for that as an excuse for 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.510
 the match then what happened 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.960
 on the match why what has 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.430
 missed in the end tonight the whole 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.370
 conviction and conviction of sold 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.980
 in the duels we had our chances 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.660
 did not score we had good 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.570
 opportunities with players who are 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.760
 often presented alone so that's it 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.570
 the finish the conclusion but it was 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.030
 a little more than year life at the time m 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.670
 bottom for to try to force the hand 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.990
 you have a particular goal to it 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.850
 two matches and one place 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.740
 would be for you the right place or 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.120
 are you already in 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.690
 in the playoffs there we had a 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.640
 goal on the last six matches on 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.040
 can still reach but it will require 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.410
 win our last two games and 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.350
 then actually before the match we 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.780
 spoke this week it's trying to 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.270
 keep the advantage of ice for 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.620
 the play-offs we lost it tonight so 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.410
 we have two games left to try 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.240
 to rectify that helps to have like 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.160
 goal of having more so the 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.510
 eighth place to finish a question 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.640
 which has nothing to do with the match but 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.970
 team has achieved a triplet is not so 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.670
 long time 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.770
 how physically he is this moment 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.330
 what is he going for yeah so what 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:37.910
 time they move in this 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:40.040
 joke this side know it's not always 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.400
 obvious to him 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.740
 he worked a lot very well 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.590
 obviously his body has a lot 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.570
 damaged and then and recover it a 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.520
 match rhythm which is very high 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.410
 now and I think he's in 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.970
 a period since a few weeks ago 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.770
 where it's hard physically for him 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.650
 all he has lived in the last year 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.630
 beyond the illness that has yet to 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.910
 not hide some traces in his 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.060
 body had a lot of products very 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.880
 toxic and that now with all the 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.180
 work that has been accomplished since 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.460
 month 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.940
 well he has a little backlash which is 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.920
 normal so I have to say it's a 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.490
 normal process if there is no 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.310
 panic but try to manage his time 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.990
 rest and fatigue but in good standing 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.690
 general has returned well he has taken 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.070
 kilos even since this summer the most 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.760
 important for him is to 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.680
 physically rebuild the city and 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.180
 took a lot of pounds compared to this 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.100
 that we left it this summer so it is in 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.210
 good track on it and confident you 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.380
 for the future that it drains is the end 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.090
 of this post-match briançon is 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.980
 now fifth to two small points 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.750
 of the dukes of angers there are two matches left
