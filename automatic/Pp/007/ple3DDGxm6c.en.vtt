180 degrees until you're holding them

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.039 
180 degrees until you're holding them
corner<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> corner<00:02:05.390> now<00:02:06.390> you're<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
corner to corner now you're going to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.260 
corner to corner now you're going to
slide<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> left<00:02:08.160> over<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> one

slide the one on the left over the one

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
slide the one on the left over the one
on<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.530> creases<00:02:11.280> or

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
on the right so that these creases or

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.180 
on the right so that these creases or
lines<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.300> overlap

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
lines here overlap

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.150 
lines here overlap
and<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.810> corner<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.890> top

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160

boomerang will be in between this corner

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.120 
boomerang will be in between this corner
here<00:02:20.310> made<00:02:20.790> by<00:02:20.970> these<00:02:21.030> two<00:02:21.390> edges<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.130> the

here in between these two edges of the
top<00:02:28.080> boomerang<00:02:29.690> once<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.650> like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
top boomerang once you have it just like

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.950 
top boomerang once you have it just like
that<00:02:31.920> we're<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.030> put<00:02:33.210> two<00:02:33.420> pieces<00:02:33.630> of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
tape on the top one here on this edge of

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.580 
tape on the top one here on this edge of
the<00:02:37.080> corner<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.790> take<00:02:39.750> two

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
pieces of tape maybe like an inch long

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.260 
pieces of tape maybe like an inch long
and<00:02:45.350> put<00:02:46.350> one<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.910> edge<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:50.030> then<00:02:51.030> put

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:01.400 
and put one on this edge and then put
one<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.870> edge<00:02:59.060> flip<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.210> over<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.570> we're

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
one on this edge flip it over and we're

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560 
one on this edge flip it over and we're
going<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.650> do<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.950> same<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.940> bottom

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.140 
to the left maybe at like a 70 degree
angle<00:05:30.710> but<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:30.979> experiment<00:05:31.490> with<00:05:31.760> it<00:05:32.000> and

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
angle but you can experiment with it and

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.899 
angle but you can experiment with it and

then rotate your hand outward similar to

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.550 
then rotate your hand outward similar to
like<00:05:35.060> when<00:05:35.390> you're<00:05:35.539> doing<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.870> yo-yo<00:05:36.110> if<00:05:36.440> you

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
like when you're doing a yo-yo if you

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.870 
like when you're doing a yo-yo if you
make<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.860> sleep<00:05:37.159> just<00:05:37.880> let<00:05:38.120> it<00:05:38.240> roll
