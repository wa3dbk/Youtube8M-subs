00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 my beautiful beautiful twins recently 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
 I came back from a trip to those who already follow me. 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.420
 there in instagram there was a little bit of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.400
 happened I searched the clip with the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.049
 best moments of this trip to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.280
 to share here with you was all recorded 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.960
 on an ipad 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.850
 then such a thing as traveler goods 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 It's in the rush but I wanted to show 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
 for you with images and not only with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 photos with moving pictures one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 bit of the places I went to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.980
 where I went I took a cruise to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 aboard the pullmantur monark ship by 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 from the Caribbean and the Antilles then 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 more or less understand where I went 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.110
 stop I left Colombia for reindeer and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 we stopped going we went to curacao 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.910
 We also stopped at la guaira in venezuela 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.640
 and ended up in Panama it was actually a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.100
 press trip a trip for journalists 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 I was 15 more journalists here in 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 Brazil, we made this trip in 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.309
 true when you board you start 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the port and descends in the same port but 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 we were not even a case apart from 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 people ended up starting a place 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.949
 ending in the other but it is not so 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.229
 works normally on the blog I made a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.510
 post saying how it was all giving the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.180
 More or less hints how much does it cost to do? 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.400
 This trip to which airport you have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.509
 Do you want to leave Brazil? 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.920
 A lot of cool pictures for you guys. 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.409
 sensational about the card people 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.740
 And the Caribbean is wonderful when people 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.640
 stop to think, you do not need to walk. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.979
 visa 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.450
 the cruise ends up being even more 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.939
 cheaper than making a trip from a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.950
 hot week ship for you to see more 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.900

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.900

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.450
