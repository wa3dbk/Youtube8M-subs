00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.259
 the mood of Mr. Rainier at Andora direct starting inter 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.880
 emotions are so many I do this 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.479
 let's call it a trade 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.139
 this passion 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.569
 just because of the emotions it gives you sometimes 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.759
 negative others are positive 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.939
 ketty unleash an unspeakable adrenaline so I'm very happy a lot 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.489
 proud to be a part 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.269
 of the Nerazzurri family 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.909
 from where it starts again 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.929
 restart if I have been called and why 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.620
 there were the real problems there was misfortune accidents 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.720
 certain things they have 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.560
 determined the change 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 of a coach this is always sorry because 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 but it is part of ours in our work of ours 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290
 drawbacks 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 so it was now the most important thing 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.230
 and regain self-esteem confidence 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.830
 and try to score points 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.790
 the target 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.650
 to that of always winning would be 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.540
 fbook the beginning of a new path nao, because the winners win here with the inter 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.430
 it would really be a thing 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.080
 the splendid 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 what we'll try to do with these guys because 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 a year and a half ago 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.460
 will be champions 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.350
 I'm a champion 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.710
 so I really hate their milan strength 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.960
 their desire for reaction 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.460
 however, those who have not slipped but the important thing in man have slipped 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.570
 and getting up and continuing to fight is what I asked them to fight from 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.210
 first to the last second 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.690
 but how I saw them fight when I played against them 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.820
 so I knew how hard it was to beat them I knew that until the last second I didn't 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.140
 they would have stopped 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.020
 here I want to see that team beyond the game systems beyond 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.899
 of who plays I want to see that group 4 and compact 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.030
 with rice that does not give up a second 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.670
 and baptized the man of the red oranges even with the interactive orange always 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 the same I believe that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.030
 where I've been there is always the obligation to necessarily win because 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.669
 if I went to Parma I knew what was needed was a hopeless situation 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.319
 because I had the obligation to win because otherwise the team would be 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.549
 relegated 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.419
 going to Rome with 0 points I knew that 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.209
 there was an obligation to win 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.539
 then there was that ride 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.949
 amazing that just crazy 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.899
 Minternal 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.689
 misfortunes of others 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.899
 but bon for me of course 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.599
 and even here I am called to win in March but when you style life 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.629
 in a team called inter you just have to think about winning 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.069
 nothing else matters 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.469
 certainly now we are thinking of winning then we will try to ifar play well 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.679
 team 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:53.269
 but now the important thing is to win kerry to get close again 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.589
 to that championship that is waiting for us 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.589
 this is the most important thing 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.239
 you got me on group haley bennett 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.079
 very clear I read that there may be some players salted 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.219
 because they have won so much 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.179
 rio 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.029
 I am here from da da 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.059
 24 hours I realized that a group knows 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.849
 a group of people who f 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.059
 there are friends are compact 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.909
 a locker room they know 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.950
 they have won a lot but those who win will continue to win 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.569
 now they are touching the bitter short mass they know what sweet is 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.779
 for which or are 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.239
 I count a lot on this just about those players who have won these champions 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.489
 because a former champion because he wins and wants to continue winning is not that 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.419
 arrives 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.769
 a victory that stops but a champion always wants to win only if he enjoys himself 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.349
 wins 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.649
 and I'm sure I have many champions in the locker room
