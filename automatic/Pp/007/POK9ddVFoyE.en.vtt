00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 we have to start with the sad news 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.919
 died Mikhail Kalashnikov legendary 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.599
 designer small arms your 94 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.700
 Birthday marked one and a half months 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.410
 back despite the venerable age 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 on health did not complain though in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.279
 recently increasingly been in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.650
 the hospital said routine examinations 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.400
 the whole world knows what an automaton is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.619
 Kalashnikov 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.920
 recently named after him and the main 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 Russian arms concern 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 if he hadn't become gunsmiths 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.810
 so surely would be Michael 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.460
 T. from Quinn as a child 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.530
 practically never parted with a pencil 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 and paper and could wake up in the middle of the night 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.239
 write down the strings come to mind but I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 satisfied 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 condition became a poet that i went by 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.899
 another way and because I have a lot 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.390
 bad poets this is another one he has always been 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.820
 romantic and at the front I dreamed how to help 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 our fighters beat the fascists today immediately 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.899
 2 cities of Trubchevsk in the Bryansk region 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.059
 Lipetsk dace argue exactly where 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
 Kalashnikov died at and when sid legend 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.619
 drew a construction that came to mind 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.659
 future automaton brilliant insight 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.020
 demanded long years of hard work 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.939
 the same legendary ak-47 appeared 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.830
 only after the war at the beginning on the drawings and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.850
 then as prototypes and only 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 after strong 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 until it was adopted later 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.210
 they will say that in 1947 really 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 became a landmark for the Soviet defense industry 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.470
 scientists have unraveled the secret of the atomic bomb a 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 Kalashnikov finish my famous 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 automaton since the constructor name has been 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.560
 inextricably linked with his brainchild for 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420
 short time in volume conquered 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 worldwide popularity its name 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.310
 became a brand and unofficial symbol 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.619
 USSR and then Russia 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.360
 american soldier and threw away his 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.100
 capricious M16 rifle and about this 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.220
 Vietnamese Soviet from AK-47 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.720
 counting on captured ammunition 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.159
 this story will repeat then and in 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.750
 afghanistan and iraq 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.429
 automatic bribed simplicity and reliability 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.159
 in the west they seriously believed that 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.200
 Kalashnikov is a closed scientific follows 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.789
 and center and were amazed that the automaton 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.619
 invented a senior sergeant suspended 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.539
 us education classes 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.370
 the designer has always spoken with respect 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.890
 Kalashnikov famous person here 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.630
 many know better than Kalashnikov 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.530
 same and genesta anara who 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.510
 maker of m16 rifle in american 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.980
 the press wrote that the Russian sergeant 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.910
 armed with the entire Warsaw unit and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.489
 were wrong 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 Kalashnikov weapons used in 55 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.120
 countries in one Kalashnikov assault rifle 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.010
 depicted on the state emblem 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.480
 some other newborn boy 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.799
 called magical in their understanding 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.510
 name collage 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.230
 Designer treated such glory 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.099
 calmly 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:47.730
 Well, I think that this is any designer 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.730
 nice if you don't pay for it 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.590
 Kalashnikov rarely wore numerous 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.780
 reward and among which are two stars 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.790
 the hero of socialist labor three orders of Lenin and 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.019
 orders of andrew the first-called even 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.209
 general designer positions 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.140
 Izhmash Michael Timofeev himself loved 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.200
 often go to the plumbing disc and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 always walked in a bathrobe deftly vice 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.500
 working humming songs for me 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.890
 therefore all songs are useful one motive 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.629
 the storm roared 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.040
 Internationale is Kalashnikov before 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.900
 the last days of jim in izhevsk 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.459
 need to have experienced just weapons 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.680
 deserved compatriots good-natured 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.420
 Timofeevich treated those who came to him 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.629
 journalists cucumber own salting 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.950
 and answered the most awkward questions like 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:45.040
 you sleep and when so many people died 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.049
 of our weapons yes does it 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 the designer is to blame this is the policy is to blame 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.680
 I will not be able to peacefully agree 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.750
 so that the weapon is not used say that 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.790
 Kalashnikov first promised to shake hands 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.410
 that constructor who could 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.669
 surpass his automaton in a lifetime 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.530
 Mikhail Timofeevich 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.530
 such constructors and found
