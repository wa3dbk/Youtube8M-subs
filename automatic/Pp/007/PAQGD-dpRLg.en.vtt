00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello guys and girls in this video os 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.040
 I will give my reasons and I will tell you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.420
 if it 's worth buying the pokemon x and the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.840
 pop or the pokemon and so stay tuned 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.619
 and let's start the 3d graphics are a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.150
 reason to buy this game because 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.509
 because they do not resemble any version 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 previous pokemon that has come out is 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.200
 say is a unique version now 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.270
 what 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.470
 there is no game that looks like the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.900
 true 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 the graphics those simple and monotonous 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.870
 that have changed for example look how 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.079
 they were before the red and the blue 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.730
 now a huge change feeling said he 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.920
 I could but can not afford 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.649
 to take out a game where so on 3 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.570
 I think that has given in the key and you go 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.660
 to see what is going to be a boom in the market 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.449
 and if not time to time but without place 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.409
 to doubt the best of all is that there 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.870
 many many pokemon that discover the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.000
 pokemon here in pokémon and we have 3 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.119
 pokédex we can see the center of the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.580
 cost the mountain and there are 7 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.600
 pokemon or there are more than 100 in each 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.780
 they are three different 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.759
 we can also have all of the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.759
 previous pressures not only the new 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:26.399
 they did some of them now 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 same I believe that for all those 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.729
 pokemon fanboys and fire when I want them 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.820
 I think this game brings us back 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.119
 that little spark we had saved from 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.500
 see good things and that's why with 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.990
 the step eyes I think the truth 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.929
 is that we're going to enjoy it a lot because 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.200
 we just have information about the game 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.149
 itself of the pokemon there are heaps that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.340
 discover, however, the theme of the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.619
 story is still the same that's not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.050
 a boy or a girl who goes by carlos 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.380
 trying to get the option to damage 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.539
 in a way catching new pokémon besides 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.459
 like a new game environments a lot 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.569
 information and therefore the history in 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.250
 yes it is a mystery 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.620
 that helps to buy the game 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.440
 also now we will be accompanied 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 by four friends 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.720
 that is, he does not love having to fight against 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.580
 one but against four different what 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.480
 makes a different perspective different 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.550
 in one place we have a new thing that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.230
 is to change the two skin tones and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.420
 besides hair until we get our 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 I virtual to go further we have 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.570
 two battle modalities on the one hand 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.480
 we have the orgaz pokemon that consists 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.330
 in which one of our pokémon luche 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.550
 against five other savages here I 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.670
 I am in favor of the series of pashas is for 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.070
 give you an idea more or less 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.740
 another part we have the aerial battles 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.660
 which are that because they 're going 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.130
 flying or with the ability to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:07.700
 levitation can fight in the air and in 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.850
 a battle mode so we have two 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.880
 battle knots that 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.800
 give a plus to buy this game another 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.610
 of the reasons to buy this game 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:24.170
 is the new type of pokemon the type to 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.690
 unique and specific pokemon and you are 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.090
 watching some of the pokemon that are from 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.260
 this type and it should be noted that some of 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.560
 the pokemon of the previous versions 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.490
 have been modified to have that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.800
 double double weight type with type and for 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.040
 finish not only we have the ores 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.530
 evolutions that are evolutions of 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.880
 some pokemon the person has of 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.440
 the version is new that we have 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.750
 evolved with some stones 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.750
 specific for that pokemon 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.270

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.860

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.670
