owning the house and we already building
it<00:01:08.200> it's<00:01:08.800> taking<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.220> little<00:01:09.340> longer<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
little more money but I think it's

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.810 
little more money but I think it's
pretty<00:01:11.500> impressive<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:12.070> we're<00:01:12.520> building

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820
