00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.200
 extremely varied I grew up in 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.079
 listening to dorothée metallica ac / dc 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.000

 smashing pumpkins jack and the machine 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.640
 or still protect myself I will also be 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.520
 always fans of artists big mouths 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.820
 pioneers like ntm iam assassins in 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.249

 m6 public enemy in the united states in 

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:11.079
 arriving at the college I lived my great 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:13.929
 period rock metal grunge pants 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.749
 riddled and festival I was a big 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.799
 fan of sound system of a down thriller 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:22.749
 downs tempelhof crazy period 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.189
 today I enjoy music so much 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.620
 rock that the raf 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 I like a lot of art 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.490
 on independent labels like lines 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.290
 elsewhere spec evidence in big brother 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 ali is in a completely different register 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.440
 I like the booba and wei instru and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.970
 I like his caramel song because 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.790
 when we listen to them and watch the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.590
 clip taking literally each of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.840
 his words we get the impression that this is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 of a song of a libertine headmaster 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 boulogne billancourt who has carded in 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.390
 the middle of caramelized candy but 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.070
 that he still has super bad 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 against competing shops but 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.040
 There's no need to say I think his instru 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 his great is double pony is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.790
 a jewel question that is also me 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 very often asked is what you have 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.840
 piercings or hitches I find 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.730
 some piercing or tattoo really 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.770
 very beautiful but the idea of ​​having some 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.930
 permanent thing on the skin did not 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.910
 never attracted I think I would arrive 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.010
 to get bored I wanted a single 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 piercing I dreamed for a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.130
 ten years ago and I was there 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.250
 twelve years 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.320
 and it's my piercing on the tongue I 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.670
 do not put all too often why because 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.890
 that I got tired here I know myself 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.270
 daphne asks me if the carrots and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.020
 tomatoes that was time yesterday that they 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.190
 would defend you I will defend tomatoes 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.860
 definitely like the so-called stone 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.480
 billon in the sad bamba and inna is 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.580
 a lot of you ask me what 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.320
 I think of the law authorizing marriage 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.280
 and adoption for couples 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 homosexuals 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.670
 and this question calls from me a 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.040
 another question why this law 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:02.239
 does not exist and not already before 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.239
 was waiting what actually 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.100
 in this debate we have the impression that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.510
 all France is the father of the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.970
 soon-to-be bride 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.019
 who asks for the hand of his son from 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.670
 Sakineh 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.780
 he has to say whether or not he is 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.250
 agree this marriage away from me the idea 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.939
 to want to hurt anyone but 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.900
 for me equality is obvious and 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.430
 so she does not even argue and this 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.379
 which is a pity in this debate this is the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.569
 we are completely forgotten about 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.190
 thousands of teens for months every 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.739
 teenagers from France who discover themselves 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.439
 homosexual and who will reach him at 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.599
 assume themselves hear in the media at 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.720
 about homosexuality the worst 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.480
 prejudices the worst arguments foolish 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.670
 issued by adult men and women 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.379
 political women spokespersons of 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.670
 movement after all that was said 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.650
 since the beginning of this debate 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.470
 I hope this law will reassure them 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.930
 and I am particularly happy that 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.510
 this law passed for these young people 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.519
 teenagers who mistakenly believe that their 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.379
 sexuality is a problem the real 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.299
 problem in France right now it's the 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.599
 advertising fungus fungus 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.310
 feet 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.049
 the one who ask us if we recognize 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.120
 and who says who slips a water whose 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.430
 toes and who settle there 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.709
 advertising is a real problem it's me 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 you recognize yourself banon no no no 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.440
 I do not recognize you I do not know you 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.880
 do not know each other but I do not know 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.590
 you are very much at this moment 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.539
 ask are you all the time 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.780
 in a good mood 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:33.750
 yes I am happy to the optimists and 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.210
 at least inexhaustible when I'm in 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.259
 trusted and respected I am someone 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.720
 of reserved enough promised it's true but 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.259
 the mean laval disrespect uses 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.419
 some ladies to feel superior 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.240
 annoys me and when I'm annoyed by these 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.430
 guidelines and it shows and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.889
 Goodbye good mood and if the conditions 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.520
 lend themselves to it I have no problem at the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.259
 know 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.330
 it is the positive consequence of having 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.910
 been a nerd who wore dresses in 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.770
 wool with my squirrel style and 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.139

 during recess as an adult on 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.310
 definitely refuses to have to endure 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.650
 the sometimes disrespectful attitude of 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.659
 people and we learn life to impose the 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.400
 respect to those whose ankles have 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.620
 sometimes a little too good 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.169
 but always be on your side 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.600
