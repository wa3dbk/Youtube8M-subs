00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.170
 since 1988 we started our dream of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.520
 support young students in their 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.420
 excellent academic training 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.940
 today 25 years later we have transformed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.450
 our story to become the 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.989
 school with the unique model of education 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.989
 individualized and personalized 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.199
 in advancing we form successful young people with 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.199
 mentality of champions 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.879
 What I like the most is the generosity of 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.820
 the teachers or they do not do it to 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.280
 one alone that help you with all the bad 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.659
 you have and the school is called 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.659
 because it does not progress anymore 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.140
 they do not need one as they do not explain to 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.920
 one things without a mind of what 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 I learned in five years here he learned it in 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.630
 three months is a very open space 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.570
 so that I can entertain is so 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.679
 free then campese learn much more 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.280
 quick much clearer easier and the 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.310
 method to study teachers the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.869
 environment that everyone ends the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.640
 friend seven students when the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.770
 teachers of the best there is because the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.539
 project there is one I misunderstood the subject 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.860
 very well stopped to win because no 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.149
 clean finish understanding with the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 teacher next door no longer helping him 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.280
 supporting everything to the compaÃ±eras only 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.729
 They receive one super good always what 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.740
 I like to move that is in the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.330
 Traditional education is not recognized 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.709
 what is your weakness 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.259
 simply standardize the 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.819
 knowledge is standardized that they should 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.830
 know all the students here 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.110
 recognizes the individual and from the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.009
 recognition of the individual is acted upon 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.009
 to improve 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.969
 thinking about young athletes 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.939
 we present the new program 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.530
 baccalaureate for champions designed 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.599
 for all those young people who 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.269
 practice sports with high level 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.079
 competition whose objective is to be 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.540
 sports-related highlights we offer 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.920
 a unique model of education 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.560
 customized with flexibility of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 schedules and teachers highly 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.159
 trained for athletes 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.250
 through an open and natural environment 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.569
 can find themselves 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.569
 becoming champions 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.950
 I dedicate myself to play high tennis 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.120
 performance since I was 6 years old I've been 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.340
 national and departmental champion yo 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.590
 I practice athletics soccer because that's what 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.930
 I like riding more 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.660
 We will support the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.070
 young athletes because we believe in their 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.070
 spirit of champions 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.310
 or the support that teachers do not give 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.319
 more than all the support with sportsman 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.870
 because it is very hard to be in a school 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.700
 Do not give support for anything and see no 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.830
 many opportunities that other schools 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.580
 they do not offer it and it has helped me a lot 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.850
 in my way of training and traveling to 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.709
 for tennis that is a law of 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.010
 opportunities is a school that you 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.860
 can overcome you can get to success very 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.989
 easy because you learn a lot and it opens you 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.739
 many doors in both your sport and 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.140
 in other things this is very demanding 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.630
 school for athletes the support is 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.910
 very big I do not say that the best school 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.510
 there's nothing like studying 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.510
 fresh air 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.360
 once 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
 move along
