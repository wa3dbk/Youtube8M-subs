00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.420 

you

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:03:56.450 

you

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.810 

so<00:03:57.460> what<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.850> could<00:03:58.030> see<00:03:58.240> so<00:03:58.510> far<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:59.490> I've<00:04:00.490> got

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
so what I could see so far is I've got

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.910 
so what I could see so far is I've got
one<00:04:01.300> prophet<00:04:02.080> broke<00:04:03.180> nothing<00:04:04.180> else<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.570> far

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
one prophet broke nothing else so far

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.960 
one prophet broke nothing else so far
again<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.100> if<00:04:06.190> you're<00:04:06.310> watching<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:06.760> you

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
again and if you're watching this you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.640 
again and if you're watching this you
probably<00:04:07.000> just<00:04:07.480> witnessed<00:04:07.900> my<00:04:08.020> crazy<00:04:08.290> crash

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
probably just witnessed my crazy crash

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.230 
probably just witnessed my crazy crash
into<00:04:09.040> those<00:04:09.220> signs<00:04:09.580> over<00:04:09.880> there<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.060> was

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
into those signs over there I was

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.000 
into those signs over there I was
basically<00:04:10.360> over<00:04:10.630> here<00:04:10.900> by<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.080> trees<00:04:11.380> came

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
basically over here by the trees came

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.500 
basically over here by the trees came
down<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.430> through<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.880> normally<00:04:13.240> make<00:04:13.300> it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
down and through and I normally make it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.730 
down and through and I normally make it
through<00:04:13.690> I've<00:04:13.780> actually<00:04:13.960> never<00:04:14.260> hit<00:04:14.530> these

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
through I've actually never hit these

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.190 
through I've actually never hit these
signs<00:04:15.250> before<00:04:15.430> but<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.060> guess<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.570> hit<00:04:16.930> too<00:04:17.080> much

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
signs before but I guess I hit too much

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.930 
signs before but I guess I hit too much
throttle<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.769> like<00:04:17.890> auto<00:04:18.130> propeller<00:04:18.549> as<00:04:18.790> I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
throttle and like auto propeller as I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.470 
throttle and like auto propeller as I
was<00:04:19.030> coming<00:04:19.150> through<00:04:19.390> so<00:04:19.780> here's<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.830> quad

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
was coming through so here's the quad

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.720 
was coming through so here's the quad
nothing<00:04:22.480> too<00:04:22.690> bad<00:04:22.900> as<00:04:23.890> far<00:04:24.370> as<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.550> can<00:04:24.610> tell

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
nothing too bad as far as I can tell

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.910 
nothing too bad as far as I can tell
I've<00:04:25.120> looked<00:04:25.420> at<00:04:25.510> all<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.900> arms<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.590> there's

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
I've looked at all the arms and there's

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.220 
I've looked at all the arms and there's
absolutely<00:04:27.490> no<00:04:27.880> cracks<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.510> no<00:04:28.750> actually

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
absolutely no cracks and no actually

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.750 
absolutely no cracks and no actually
impact<00:04:29.650> mark<00:04:29.920> so<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.250> feeling<00:04:30.670> this

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
impact mark so I have a feeling this

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.650 
impact mark so I have a feeling this
back<00:04:31.690> right<00:04:32.560> propeller<00:04:33.040> number<00:04:33.430> one<00:04:33.670> got

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
back right propeller number one got

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.530 
back right propeller number one got
smashed<00:04:35.290> by<00:04:35.680> design<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:36.850> that's<00:04:37.060> what<00:04:37.240> took<00:04:37.390> it

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
smashed by design so that's what took it

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.000 
smashed by design so that's what took it
out<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.840> air<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.350> cuz<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:38.560> did<00:04:38.770> try<00:04:38.980> to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
out of the air so I cuz I did try to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.500 
out of the air so I cuz I did try to
throttle<00:04:39.310> up<00:04:39.550> as<00:04:39.670> I<00:04:39.820> was<00:04:39.910> looking<00:04:40.210> through<00:04:40.240> the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
throttle up as I was looking through the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.540 
throttle up as I was looking through the
air<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:41.740> might<00:04:41.920> have<00:04:42.010> seen<00:04:42.190> in<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.430> video

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
air you might have seen in the video

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.640 
air you might have seen in the video
