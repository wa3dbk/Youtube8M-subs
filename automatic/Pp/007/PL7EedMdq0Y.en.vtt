coming<00:00:50.730> through<00:00:51.500> here<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.960> originally<00:00:54.960> was

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
coming through here I originally was

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.200 
coming through here I originally was
gonna<00:00:55.289> run<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:58.039> SATA<00:00:59.660> eSATA<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> back

gonna run the SATA eSATA from the back

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.600 
gonna run the SATA eSATA from the back
behind<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.570> motherboards<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
behind the motherboards right but the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.359 
behind the motherboards right but the
the<00:01:06.060> lines<00:01:06.900> aren't<00:01:07.260> long<00:01:07.560> enough<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.810> go

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
the lines aren't long enough to go

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
the lines aren't long enough to go
behind<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> motherboard<00:01:11.939> tray<00:01:12.119> through<00:01:12.869> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
behind the motherboard tray through here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.789 
behind the motherboard tray through here
and<00:01:14.450> plug<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.090> had<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> run<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.900> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and plug in so I had to run that this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.510 
and plug in so I had to run that this
way<00:01:20.900> there<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.909> 24<00:01:23.909> pin<00:01:24.150> power<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.520> there

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
way there is the 24 pin power and there

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.590 
way there is the 24 pin power and there
is<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> rerun<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.600> but

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
is the I'm gonna have to rerun this but

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.870 
is the I'm gonna have to rerun this but
there<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:32.869> four<00:01:33.869> pin<00:01:34.079> power<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> data

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
there is the four pin power and the data

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
there is the four pin power and the data
cable<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> optical<00:01:42.810> drive<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.710> going

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
cable from the optical drive is going

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
cable from the optical drive is going
through<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.729> installed<00:01:47.240> an<00:01:48.240> external<00:01:48.930> or

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
through there I installed an external or

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
through there I installed an external or
uh<00:01:49.759> sorry<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.020> 140<00:01:52.020> millimeter<00:01:52.439> fan<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.610> top

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
uh sorry a 140 millimeter fan up top

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.209 
uh sorry a 140 millimeter fan up top
there<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.659> two<00:01:54.930> 140<00:01:55.530> millimeter<00:01:55.920> fans

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
there so there's two 140 millimeter fans

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.770 
there so there's two 140 millimeter fans
and<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.860> hard<00:01:59.070> drive<00:01:59.340> there's<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.360> cable

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and the hard drive there's this cable

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.530 
and the hard drive there's this cable
mess<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:02.280> gonna<00:02:02.460> run<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.939> all

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
mess right here I was gonna run it all

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.310 
mess right here I was gonna run it all
up<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> there

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
up in there

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.610 
up in there
but<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> better<00:02:10.140> view

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
but you get a better view

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.900 
but you get a better view
but<00:02:12.519> opted<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.150> run<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.489> just<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.640> get<00:02:15.730> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
but opted to run it there just to get it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.369 
but opted to run it there just to get it
done<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.620> couple<00:02:17.950> hours<00:02:18.310> here<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:20.290> this

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
done at a couple hours here on this

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.750 
done at a couple hours here on this
there<00:02:23.379> are<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:25.569> thumb<00:02:25.840> screws<00:02:26.519> for<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
there are the thumb screws for the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.140 
there are the thumb screws for the
optical<00:02:28.510> drive<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:30.580> are<00:02:30.790> plastic<00:02:32.849> but<00:02:33.849> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
optical drive and they are plastic but I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.979 
optical drive and they are plastic but I
mean<00:02:34.930> they're<00:02:35.099> they're<00:02:36.099> easy<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.790> do<00:02:37.720> turn

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
mean they're they're easy to do turn

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.460 
mean they're they're easy to do turn
though<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.319> mean<00:02:38.560> they're<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:41.140> know<00:02:41.230> there's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
though I mean they're you know there's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.009 
though I mean they're you know there's
good<00:02:42.040> grip<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.519> there<00:02:43.739> I've<00:02:44.739> seen<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> lot<00:02:45.190> of

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
good grip on there I've seen a lot of

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.110 
good grip on there I've seen a lot of
thumb<00:02:47.019> screws<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.739> were<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:49.030> know

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
thumb screws that were you know

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120 
thumb screws that were you know
basically<00:02:49.569> said<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.140> third<00:02:50.319> thumb<00:02:50.799> screws

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
basically said the third thumb screws

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.770 
basically said the third thumb screws
but<00:02:51.430> they're<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:52.630> short<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:54.250> know

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
but they're so short that you know

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.589 
but they're so short that you know
there's<00:02:55.780> no<00:02:56.019> way<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:57.390> yeah<00:02:58.390> you'd

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
there's no way you can get a yeah you'd

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.150 
there's no way you can get a yeah you'd
have<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.930> use<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> screwdriver<00:02:59.530> but<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:02.160> mounted

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
have to use a screwdriver but I mounted

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.780 
have to use a screwdriver but I mounted
the<00:03:03.430> optical<00:03:04.000> drive<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.810> second<00:03:05.610> five<00:03:06.610> and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the optical drive in the second five and

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.690 
the optical drive in the second five and
a<00:03:06.819> quarter<00:03:07.000> bay<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:12.340> wasn't

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
a quarter bay because the it wasn't

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.080 
a quarter bay because the it wasn't
going<00:03:12.849> back<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:13.989> fan<00:03:14.349> on<00:03:14.650> top<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.910> is

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
going back with that fan on top this is

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.900 
going back with that fan on top this is
a<00:03:16.269> pretty<00:03:16.510> short<00:03:17.730> optical<00:03:18.730> drive<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.389> guess<00:03:19.780> but

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
a pretty short optical drive I guess but

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.849 
a pretty short optical drive I guess but
with<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.060> on<00:03:22.180> top<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.989> was<00:03:23.109> sticking<00:03:23.380> out<00:03:23.560> just

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
with it on top it was sticking out just

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.309 
with it on top it was sticking out just

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
recommend with this case this is a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.340 
recommend with this case this is a
decent<00:05:19.440> case<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:20.790> only<00:05:21.000> two<00:05:21.690> issues<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.170> have

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
decent case the only two issues I have

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.750 
decent case the only two issues I have
is<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.830> front<00:05:23.070> bezel<00:05:24.410> removing<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.610> if<00:05:26.610> you

is the front bezel removing it if you
have<00:05:26.940> to<00:05:27.120> remove<00:05:27.420> it<00:05:27.630> there's<00:05:28.530> no<00:05:28.710> real<00:05:29.010> good

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
have to remove it there's no real good

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.510 
have to remove it there's no real good
way<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:30.290> you<00:05:31.290> know<00:05:32.540> set<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.690> down
