00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to all guys and welcome to a 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 new video today I'll show you how to cure 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.870
 at best our small orchid 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.000
 premise or advice replace the two 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 they are responsible I do not recommend 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.949
 buy architet because he needs to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 there is a great deal of care first 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109
 various methods for say with the schalke 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.060
 idea I was the one of peace in the in 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.859
 this case, however, let's say mine 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.820
 sink plugged I contacted her 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.559
 baby we have to alternate clean water 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:48.989
 hot water until we reach it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:51.030
 the average temperature once 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 we understood the basin and the adam 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.460
 reached the desired temperature imperia 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 hand on creates once you limmer 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.530
 dialogue with the hand we make of the water 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.080
 above the leaves anyway because vi 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.560
 then I explain the orchid if it went to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 below we say from the holes and from above instead 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.610
 even the water comes because they are there 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 some states a little more than 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 peter a little more big smoke must 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 do this bitrel procedure at random 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.430
 only wins to these layers so that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.130
 we all say all the bass is hair d 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.479
 water 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 once this is done we take the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:39.900
 our idea and I do muscle then 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.009
 now let's talk about the care of 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.990
 this plant this plant must be 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.960
 watered once a week 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 I chose Sunday as day and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.950
 I tell you something don't panic 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.880
 when the plant after behind in music 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.090
 you bought it 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.860
 don't make any more flowers and lose them because it is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.540
 a very normal thing 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.250
 in fact this has been here for two months 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.929
 completely the first of flowers instead 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.939
 I'm down here three months 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.550
 as you have seen unless I explain flowers 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.709
 why this house after a bit of 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.379
 time begins to lose its leaves and also 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.209
 many times it happens as it happened to 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.580
 lawn from some people I know that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.760
 to these these branches are made 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.709
 completely we say with sisti century 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.560
 completely so they must be 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.209
 voted to the trocar 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.700
 think that now that today flowers are 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.170
 lucky because you need to know that 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.060
 most times jolie not 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.830
 they remain just and the plant must 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.709
 be brought to three quarters again 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.720
 but I don't know how they stayed 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.010
 these two flowers that this flowers 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.489
 let's say it's the one that's better respect 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 many other people too 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.099
 they throw the orchids because they repair you 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.290
 after the roots that come out some time 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.510
 outside that is what is done by all of 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.790
 this color 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.660
 and then the various branches and flowers there 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.489
 I am more 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.129
 many times even the leaves begin to 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.739
 dry and those people not so much 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.560
 passionate thinking that they throw 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.530
 let them be sins but not only death there 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.780
 I explain one thing you can see it from 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.319
 underground roots for this that 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.480
 orchids 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.760
 we say we find them more in 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.220
 transparent vases just to see the 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.739
 roots because in practice if these 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.030
 roots are still green tell yourself that the 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.549
 card still alive 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.190
 if instead the curls at these have here 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.859
 this color we say so is dead 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.739
 in fact the whole plant happened there 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.319
 person I know who sings it 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.260
 leaves I have to see if the born had been 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.049
 they will become completely brown 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.359
 there were no buckets and speeders there 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.540
 but she gave you by sending from these 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.040
 roots the waterfall regularly indeed 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.640
 the plant after we say two three months 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.819
 fiesta do others throw others high 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.549
 obviously the orcs of the months buds 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.019
 on so many types know those of 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.530
 viola with the reads to the call 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.390
 bands and we say that they are acquired not 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.129
 I remember 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.000
 sorry for homo precisely not me 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.709
 I remember the name 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.420
 But there are these types of orchids 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.850
 politicians seem to me to mean in 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.340
 larino butterfly because they own them 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.449
 flowers and suffered the lady butterflies 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.160
 then of the others that instead with these 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.380
 leaves a little elongated c with delle 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.630
 leaves that stretch, however, mono to the mi 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.360
 I remember however I remember that it is called 90 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.250
 in fact there is lavender and purple and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.110
 these cases may be 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.610
 all types even smaller 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.009
 in fact cysts exist orchids 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.550
 meghni that even if they are smaller 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:46.900
 they cost more though than all and the vi 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.370
 greeting serves must of curiosity 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.370
