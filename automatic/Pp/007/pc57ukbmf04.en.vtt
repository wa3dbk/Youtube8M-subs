00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.240
 makeup tutorial how can you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.370
 to be realizing I have things 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
 different from the ones I usually carry in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 my day to day and through in my 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.100
 makeup and in you know why today 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.930
 I bring a look inspired by coach was 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.240
 for those who do not know who is a coach in the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 kitchen is a music festival that is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.830
 takes place for three days in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 california usa and while they do not adapt 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.560
 to our tendencies now here in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 argentina that we are in autumn 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 precisely the season in winter 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 obviously spring trends 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.930
 summer there but I liked it very much 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 the idea and I could not stop creating them 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 this video and I was not going to wait until 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 be spring so good you guys 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.100
 obviously as always in all my 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.620
 tutorials also what they like most 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 what suits your needs 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.469
 sugar mill with its products that have 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 but hey it is more than anything 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 share with you this look 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.469
 really liked to recreate something different 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.469
 although I did not leave the neutral which is what 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.300
 what I usually do in my eyes is like 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.949
 that has a little bit different 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.800
 obviously this is not something that I would use 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 day by day and much less something neutral 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.510
 change a bit and incorporate a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 little bit more looks more varied to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 channel I decided to bring you be very inspired 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 coaching since last Wednesday and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 I'm bringing you the inspired looks 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 in the case of last Wednesday they 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.990
 I brought a look inspired by make up that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 It's on that street and sener but obviously 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.730
 it did not stop being a neutral look like me 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.550
 like as always I extra all in the 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.020
 easier, more neutral and wearable looks 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.330
 possible because able and bring them a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 look all the color is fuchsia purple 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.680
 yellow myself I would not know how to use it 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 and I would not know how to present it so 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.740
 well let's go bit by bit 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 incorporating those things to the channel but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.090
 Well, I liked it a lot, because if 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.460
 well as I already told you, it is still a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.830
 neutral look has its obvious touches 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.000
 that they give pop to makeup so 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.310
 good if you want to know how 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.230
 applying this set in one of the brand 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.600
 capi lattice so that my hair does not have 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.390
 Frizz was brilliant and perfect during 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.830
 all night although good is a 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.979
 half imaginary festival because it has already 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.470
 past but good this understand 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.610
 how to flatten the top part I'm going 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.200
 to leave half thanks 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.510
 but he swears it gives them a shine 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.430
 incredible and what I'm going to do 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.500
 is apply me is like pinchi are you 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.629
 flowers were super trendy in the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.000
 summer and good are fashionable in the 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.480
 spring-summer trends over there 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.069
 in the USA and in all countries wherever 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.209
 spring-summer truth that I love 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.519
 and what I am doing here simply 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.349
 in it is admitted the around I like 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.299
 very much because it is a super super look 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.829
 simple and we will be able to give you a little 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.299
 more work prominence at 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.410
 makeup that is what most excites me 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.450
 of this look 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.740
 and now we are going to start with the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.290
 makeup the first thing I'm doing 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.450
 with this mate town is to apply it 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.880
 throughout my eyelid so that I do not 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.100
 better not in folds and have a base 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.740
 to apply a shadows the first shadow 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.530
 that I am applying is this matte shadow 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.970
 in medium brown tone according to my tone of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 skin and now what I'm going to do is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.900
 apply a shadow vanilla also beats 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.420
 in what would be all the eyelid mobile 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.130
 with a cat tongue 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 what I'm doing is I go back to the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.470
 skewer with shake the medium brown 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.020
 to blur these two colors and I'm going to 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.510
 start filling my pieces because a 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.670
 very clear point of this makeup that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.920
 I was watching the corchera is the eyebrows 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.810
 well marked and good just that was 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.850
 what he wanted to achieve then he put on makeup 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.550
 with a shadow a little darker than 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.040
 what to use false eyelashes for 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.080
 I am inevitable, I have little too 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.269
 I have super action so I think that 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.680
 this gives the touch super wow to 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.950
 make up if you have some 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.750
 perfect eyelashes parts of this step 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.520
 but what I'm doing is making myself a 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.980
 simple face makeup I'm going to 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.019
 apply the corrector blur it because 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.670
 let's focus on something that 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.670
 I'll show you later 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.210
 once our proofreader is 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.980
 perfectly blurred what you 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.380
 not seal it with the same dust that I 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.750
 apply on the eyes in this case is a 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.670
 of marilyn that modifies and now with this 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.260
 I'm going to 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.090
 apply in the middle of my eyelids to 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.370
 give more light and that my eye 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.660
 even bigger figure with the brush 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.430
 he also gives me the one I'm doing 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.709
 is to apply the middle brown shade below 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.690
 and blur the for my eyes look 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.610
 increasingly larger I will also apply 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.430
 the same shadow that I applied in the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.470
 middle of the eye in the lacrimal that I'm going to 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.500
 happen to apply to me browser is that you 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.000
 They know that it's not very much but I 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.740
 I'm going to apply with the intention of 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.840
 Tan your face because you know 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.550
 be in a season where it's hot 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.560
 and where they are balanced and good I 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.880
 I'm on the contrary, then 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.580
 just what I'm doing is 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.950
 Tan a little dot on the cheekbones and 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.330
 with a smaller brush carrying it 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.330
 as if it were blush 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.950
 now with this color tattoo of medium 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.230
 lemon capital in the star part of 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.600
 this makeup inspired by chela that 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.450
 are this kind of diamond could you 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.730
 say little lights made with shadows 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.860
 obviously you can use the 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.810
 stickers that many girls that 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.910
 they were cost but they were pretty 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.220
 good to do something different with 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.990
 properly makeup and in this case 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.640
 replacement of this color of your 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.490
 Maybelline I know that I'm not going to 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.700
 move throughout the night although good not 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.690
 I'm going to go to the I'm reviewing and sealing 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.330
 with a golden umbrella so that it is 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.400
 much more intense now what I'm going to 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.260
 to do is make a few pointless nonsense 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.810
 some one to roll liquids for 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.550
 give it a more different touch and I take advantage 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.500
 and incidentally I do not cover or glue 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.570
 eyelashes because mine does not dry black 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.490
 ideal if you go to a festival 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.040
 geoffrey to ultra coaching or whatever 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.450
 apply a lip balm since I 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.460
 I had forgotten to mix the details 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.930
 with the chalk so that's why I'm 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.400
 applying the mascara but well that's it 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.400
 how is the final look 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.020
 and one held by sent and I hope that 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.420

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.340

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.310
 little bit of pain though good hairstyle 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.600
 that I brought them is not complicated and 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.190
