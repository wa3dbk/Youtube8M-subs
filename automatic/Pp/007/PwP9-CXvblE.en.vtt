00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 hello everyone talks to them friman this time I come to clarify about a point criticized 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.810
 of the wii about which many say that when the casual think that once 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.700
 that they feel fresh in the world of videogames 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.409
 after the wii has introduced them to the market 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.650
 they pass to the competition as they have subjected mythical soft 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.660
 today I come to demonstrate that this statement is totally false for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.060
 start we owe certain points 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.640
 in the last generation of nintendo the cube despite its low sales 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.980
 It was a console more than competitive but that was not able to appreciate 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.830
 let's see for example some of his games more jar corp 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.200
 who achieved the best positions in terms of sales 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.650
 how can we notice we have a super is more bros thousand and with 7 million copies 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.910
 sold 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 Now let's see how Raúl is doing in this generation 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.330
 As we can see the sales have reached 7 point 47 million 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.070
 copies in other words 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.530
 the followers of the saga have grown 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.840
 Yes sirs 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.940
 in less than a year the sales that reached the previous delivery have been reached 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.020
 let's see another saga 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.820
 mario kart dabul data 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 4 million copies were sold in the bucket 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460
 let's see how mario kart wii is doing 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.200
 Well, they did not even imagine it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.260
 in less than a year he has doubled his sales is the saga that more followers has 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.280
 got 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.830
 the same thing we can see with for example by reading cell 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.120
 Darwin Curry who managed to sell his three points 1 million copies 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.790
 how will túa and the igp princess de güidi 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.250
 as expected 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 reached 4 points 5 million copies sold 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.160
 and so we can see this also with the saga of metroid meter and pavements not 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.430
 reached the million while the 3 already reached its 1 point 3 million 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.870
 copies sold 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.020
 Something important to note is that these games have just been released 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.620
 maximum one year ago 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.110
 and now they have achieved excellent sales comparing with the time that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 they sold their gay prequels in Quito 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.920
 sales will continue to increase that's logical 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.290
 as a conclusion that we can affirm 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.460
 Nintendo has managed to get the same casuals that they have attracted 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.389
 as regular players 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.599
 have made some who went over to the competition come back 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:20.199
 with this I show you that nintendo has achieved more gaimer sque with the 21 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.879
 so for those who say that casuals will not continue to mature with wii 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.119
 You can get your silly affirmations in your ass 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.649
 something that should also be noted is this 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.939
 run away to have both casual players like jar corkery month 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.399
 let's see the best-selling games to date 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:40.089
 wii sport is already included in all regions except Japan 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.409
 Wii play and comes included when buying a Wiimote 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.799
 so do not take it so much into account 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.729
 let's see what follows 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.129
 i have seen it well 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.939
 Mario Kart Wii is actually the best-selling game of Wii 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.709
 followed by wii fit and immediately by super is more bros brawl 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.149
 with this I show you that will actually is a console aimed at everything 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.709
 public thing that nintendo has maintained in its policy since the nes 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.349
 Not if I find more fundamental information I make new videos 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.129
 You can see the information in a link that you placed in the description of the video 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.379
 says goodbye 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.819
 goodbye
