00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
and out of the purl bumps in such a way

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.320 
and out of the purl bumps in such a way
that<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:47.020> isn't<00:04:47.319> going<00:04:47.409> to<00:04:47.500> show<00:04:50.939> and<00:04:51.939> I'm<00:04:52.120> not

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
that it isn't going to show and I'm not

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.999 
that it isn't going to show and I'm not
pulling<00:04:52.599> too<00:04:52.930> tightly<00:04:55.439> I'm<00:04:56.439> just<00:04:56.710> gonna<00:04:56.800> go

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
pulling too tightly I'm just gonna go

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:03.740 
pulling too tightly I'm just gonna go
out<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.860> I'm<00:05:00.009> gonna<00:05:00.129> pull<00:05:00.520> up<00:05:01.509> a<00:05:01.750> little<00:05:01.960> bit

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
out and I'm gonna pull up a little bit

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.270 
out and I'm gonna pull up a little bit
cut<00:05:04.750> real<00:05:04.930> close<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.469> then<00:05:07.979> if<00:05:08.979> you're<00:05:09.250> using

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
cut real close and then if you're using

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.589 
cut real close and then if you're using
wool<00:05:09.879> or<00:05:10.379> even<00:05:11.379> a<00:05:11.439> wool<00:05:11.620> blend<00:05:12.030> it's<00:05:13.030> going<00:05:13.389> to

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
wool or even a wool blend it's going to

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.480 
wool or even a wool blend it's going to
felt<00:05:14.199> inside<00:05:14.710> there<00:05:15.009> and<00:05:15.099> you<00:05:15.190> won't<00:05:15.310> ever

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
felt inside there and you won't ever

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.209 
felt inside there and you won't ever
have<00:05:15.729> to<00:05:15.759> worry<00:05:15.909> about<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.560> this<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.740> acrylic

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
have to worry about it this is acrylic

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.709 
have to worry about it this is acrylic
and<00:05:18.639> so<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:21.759> smart<00:05:22.060> thing<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.300> do<00:05:22.539> with

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
and so the smart thing to do with

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:29.730 
and so the smart thing to do with
acrylic<00:05:23.139> would<00:05:23.289> be<00:05:23.469> to<00:05:28.169> go<00:05:29.169> in<00:05:29.379> and<00:05:29.560> out<00:05:29.680> of

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
acrylic would be to go in and out of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:41.269 
acrylic would be to go in and out of
pearl<00:05:30.099> bumps<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:34.389> go<00:05:35.289> around<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:36.250> purl<00:05:36.940> bump<00:05:37.240> a

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.760 

couple<00:05:42.279> times<00:05:43.029> if<00:05:43.330> you<00:05:43.449> can<00:05:43.750> without<00:05:44.560> having

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
couple times if you can without having

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.110 
couple times if you can without having
it<00:05:45.039> show

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.990 

we're<00:05:49.630> not<00:05:49.810> diving<00:05:50.080> here

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.360 

what<00:05:53.360> time

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.620 

there<00:06:00.210> so<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.270> really<00:06:01.389> can't<00:06:01.900> see<00:06:02.199> where<00:06:02.889> I

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
there so you really can't see where I

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.630 
there so you really can't see where I
added
