ways now when we look at the holding
game<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.920> more<00:01:34.920> advanced<00:01:35.310> players

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
game will see that more advanced players

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
game will see that more advanced players
don't<00:01:36.240> often<00:01:36.540> play<00:01:37.020> roles<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.920> 6<00:01:38.310> 3<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.030> 5<00:01:40.020> 4

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
don't often play roles like 6 3 or 5 4

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.609 
don't often play roles like 6 3 or 5 4
in<00:01:41.490> ways<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:42.570> them<00:01:42.780> into<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> running

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
in ways that get them into a running

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.620 
in ways that get them into a running
game<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.520> running<00:01:44.880> games<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:46.079> simpler<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
game so running games are simpler to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.780 
game so running games are simpler to
execute<00:01:48.630> than<00:01:49.020> other<00:01:49.320> types<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:50.009> game<00:01:50.280> plans

execute than other types of game plans

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.719 
execute than other types of game plans
and<00:01:51.380> especially<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.130> less

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
experience than your opponent there's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.740 
experience than your opponent there's
nothing<00:01:58.079> wrong<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.729> taking<00:01:59.729> opening<00:02:00.420> rolls

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
nothing wrong with taking opening rolls

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.590 
nothing wrong with taking opening rolls
in<00:02:01.290> ways<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:02.219> would<00:02:02.399> put<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.210> a

game now how would you proceed from
there<00:02:35.349> let's<00:02:36.069> suppose<00:02:36.519> white<00:02:37.510> rolled<00:02:38.370> an

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
play the five down to there you then

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.619 
play the five down to there you then
rolled<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.860> six<00:02:48.160> four<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:50.549> now<00:02:51.549> you're<00:02:52.390> much

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
rolled a six four and now you're much

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.960 
rolled a six four and now you're much
more<00:02:52.959> advanced<00:02:53.349> than<00:02:53.709> your<00:02:54.099> opponent<00:02:54.790> who

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
more advanced than your opponent who

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.839 
more advanced than your opponent who
rolled<00:02:55.299> only<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> five<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:58.379> if<00:02:59.379> your<00:03:00.190> opponent

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
rolled only a five one if your opponent

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.839 
rolled only a five one if your opponent
didn't<00:03:01.239> hit<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.799> say<00:03:02.799> your<00:03:03.310> opponent<00:03:03.910> rolled

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
didn't hit you say your opponent rolled

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.720 
didn't hit you say your opponent rolled
some<00:03:06.849> other<00:03:07.150> number<00:03:07.780> maybe<00:03:09.299> for<00:03:10.299> wine<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
some other number maybe for wine and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.110 
some other number maybe for wine and
split<00:03:12.730> there<00:03:13.859> what<00:03:14.859> would<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.220> next<00:03:15.669> do<00:03:15.880> if

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
split there what would you next do if

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.379 
split there what would you next do if
you're<00:03:16.329> into<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> running<00:03:17.139> game<00:03:17.349> well<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:19.180> were

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
you're into a running game well you were

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.629 
you're into a running game well you were
hoping<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.079> wouldn't<00:03:20.349> get<00:03:20.650> hit<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.519> and

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
hoping you wouldn't get hit here and

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.879 
hoping you wouldn't get hit here and
sent<00:03:22.239> back<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.900> beginning<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.650> that

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
sent back to the beginning and that

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.220 
sent back to the beginning and that
didn't<00:03:24.340> happen<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:25.120> now<00:03:25.299> you're<00:03:25.599> ahead<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
didn't happen so now you're ahead in the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.970 
didn't happen so now you're ahead in the
race

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.620 

what<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.160> would<00:03:30.340> like<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.579> do<00:03:30.970> suppose<00:03:31.389> he

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
what you would like to do suppose he

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.949 
what you would like to do suppose he
rolled<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.290> five<00:03:32.889> four<00:03:33.430> suppose<00:03:33.970> blue<00:03:34.389> roles<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
rolled a five four suppose blue roles of

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.629 
rolled a five four suppose blue roles of
five<00:03:35.230> for<00:03:36.000> what<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.120> would<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:37.989> is

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
five for what you would like to do is

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.839 
five for what you would like to do is
establish<00:03:39.780> some<00:03:40.780> safe<00:03:41.109> landing<00:03:42.040> places

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
establish some safe landing places

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.370 
establish some safe landing places
especially<00:03:43.299> out<00:03:43.900> here<00:03:44.349> in<00:03:44.680> your<00:03:45.010> outer<00:03:45.669> board

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
especially out here in your outer board

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.979 
especially out here in your outer board
so<00:03:47.380> if<00:03:47.739> from<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.280> position<00:03:48.549> like<00:03:48.940> this<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.630> rolled

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
so if from a position like this I rolled

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.770 
so if from a position like this I rolled
something<00:03:50.500> like<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.709> five<00:03:51.099> for<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:52.359> would<00:03:52.569> want

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
something like a five for you would want

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.349 
something like a five for you would want
to<00:03:52.870> make<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.079> point<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.980> helps<00:03:54.730> block<00:03:54.970> your

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
to make a point it helps block your

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.050 
to make a point it helps block your
opponent's<00:03:55.620> checkers<00:03:56.620> but<00:03:57.190> more<00:03:57.430> importantly

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
opponent's checkers but more importantly

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.449 
opponent's checkers but more importantly
if<00:03:58.329> you're<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.780> running<00:03:59.169> game<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.709> gives<00:04:00.280> you

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
if you're in a running game it gives you

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.129 
if you're in a running game it gives you
a<00:04:00.489> safe<00:04:00.910> spot<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.780> land<00:04:02.379> on<00:04:03.450> next<00:04:04.450> we'll<00:04:04.720> talk

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
a safe spot to land on next we'll talk

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.589 
a safe spot to land on next we'll talk
about<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.530> difference<00:04:06.129> between<00:04:06.250> an<00:04:06.940> indirect
