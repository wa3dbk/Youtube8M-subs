now is my indoor palm clinic

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.999 
now is my indoor palm clinic
I've<00:00:12.410> had<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:12.710> inside<00:00:14.530> after<00:00:15.530> being<00:00:15.709> outside

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
I've had this inside after being outside

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.009 
I've had this inside after being outside
all<00:00:16.369> summer<00:00:17.320> for<00:00:18.320> I<00:00:18.710> think<00:00:18.980> about<00:00:19.250> a<00:00:19.840> month<00:00:20.840> and

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
all summer for I think about a month and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.870 
all summer for I think about a month and
a<00:00:21.050> half<00:00:21.080> maybe<00:00:21.949> a<00:00:22.099> little<00:00:22.400> bit<00:00:22.519> longer<00:00:22.730> than

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
a half maybe a little bit longer than

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.310 
a half maybe a little bit longer than
that<00:00:23.000> I'll<00:00:23.720> have<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:24.310> double-check<00:00:26.320> basically

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
that I'll have to double-check basically

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.290 
that I'll have to double-check basically
the<00:00:27.500> things<00:00:27.710> are<00:00:27.949> main<00:00:28.910> things<00:00:29.179> to<00:00:30.250> note<00:00:31.300> it's

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
the things are main things to note it's

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.280 
the things are main things to note it's
still<00:00:32.540> losing<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.110> lot<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.410> yellow<00:00:33.830> leaves<00:00:35.290> I've

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
still losing a lot of yellow leaves I've

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.530 
still losing a lot of yellow leaves I've
gotten<00:00:36.650> pretty<00:00:36.920> used<00:00:36.979> to<00:00:37.190> that<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:38.269> doesn't

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
gotten pretty used to that it doesn't

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.469 
gotten pretty used to that it doesn't
really<00:00:38.659> concern<00:00:38.870> me<00:00:39.080> anymore<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.820> also<00:00:41.000> it's

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
really concern me anymore and also it's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.450 
really concern me anymore and also it's
really<00:00:41.540> been<00:00:41.839> taking<00:00:42.170> off<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:43.040> was<00:00:43.190> quite

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
really been taking off it was quite

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.680 
really been taking off it was quite
wishy<00:00:43.670> before<00:00:44.119> and<00:00:44.360> now<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:45.530> become<00:00:46.010> more<00:00:46.820> of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.549 

shooting<00:00:50.690> out<00:00:51.070> into<00:00:52.070> these<00:00:52.250> big<00:00:52.640> leagues<00:00:52.909> like

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
shooting out into these big leagues like

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.460 
shooting out into these big leagues like
see<00:00:54.559> how<00:00:54.650> tall<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.549> is<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:55.930> it's<00:00:56.930> quite<00:00:57.229> a<00:00:57.260> bit

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
see how tall it is now it's quite a bit

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.130 
see how tall it is now it's quite a bit
taller<00:00:57.619> than<00:00:57.920> was<00:00:58.070> before<00:00:58.430> also<00:00:59.119> the<00:00:59.600> newer

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
taller than was before also the newer

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.490 
taller than was before also the newer
growth<00:01:00.680> towards<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.519> top<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:01.939> tips<00:01:02.500> these

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
growth towards the top of the tips these

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.160 
growth towards the top of the tips these
leaves<00:01:03.799> are<00:01:04.040> huge<00:01:04.460> compared<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> other

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
leaves are huge compared to the other

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.709 
leaves are huge compared to the other
ones<00:01:06.430> let<00:01:07.430> me<00:01:07.549> bring<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.030> little<00:01:08.270> closer

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.999 

you<00:01:11.719> can<00:01:11.840> see<00:01:11.990> these<00:01:12.140> are<00:01:12.320> more<00:01:12.469> like<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:12.829> size

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
you can see these are more like the size

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.690 
you can see these are more like the size
of<00:01:13.280> like<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.460> outdoor<00:01:14.329> Bush<00:01:14.840> plant<00:01:15.549> pretty<00:01:16.549> good

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
of like a outdoor Bush plant pretty good

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.870 
of like a outdoor Bush plant pretty good
size<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:18.369> basic<00:01:19.369> got<00:01:19.549> three<00:01:19.789> main<00:01:20.179> sheets

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.340 

now<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.240> basically<00:01:25.570> just<00:01:25.720> going<00:01:26.110> all<00:01:26.320> over

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
now it's basically just going all over

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.870 
now it's basically just going all over
the<00:01:26.530> place<00:01:26.770> it's<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.159> growing<00:01:27.490> with<00:01:27.670> this

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
the place it's like growing with this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.899 
the place it's like growing with this
overtalk<00:01:28.360> amount<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.750> plants<00:01:29.080> so<00:01:29.920> really<00:01:30.670> my

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
overtalk amount of plants so really my

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.200 
overtalk amount of plants so really my
only<00:01:31.030> choice<00:01:31.300> I'm<00:01:31.659> going<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.990> prune<00:01:32.229> this<00:01:33.210> back

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
only choice I'm going to prune this back

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.890 
only choice I'm going to prune this back
quite<00:01:34.630> dramatically<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:37.270> not<00:01:37.420> too<00:01:37.600> worried

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
quite dramatically I'm not too worried

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.960 
quite dramatically I'm not too worried
about<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.259> results<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.710> I'm<00:01:39.670> pretty

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
about the results of that I'm pretty

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.690 
about the results of that I'm pretty
sure<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.650> know<00:01:41.770> as<00:01:42.040> this<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.430> growing

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
sure that you know as this is growing

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.950 
sure that you know as this is growing
the<00:01:43.119> roots<00:01:43.330> are<00:01:43.509> going<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:44.590> know<00:01:44.710> nicely<00:01:45.960> so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
the roots are going you know nicely so

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.649 
the roots are going you know nicely so
you<00:01:47.830> know<00:01:47.920> I'll<00:01:48.190> cut<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.640> back<00:01:48.820> quite<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.450> bit

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
you know I'll cut it back quite a bit

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.310 
you know I'll cut it back quite a bit
and<00:01:49.899> you<00:01:50.830> know<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:52.149> stronger<00:01:52.600> or<00:01:52.810> now

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
and you know the stronger or now

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.529 
and you know the stronger or now
stronger<00:01:53.649> root<00:01:53.890> system<00:01:54.310> should<00:01:55.090> easily<00:01:55.360> be

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
stronger root system should easily be

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.410 
stronger root system should easily be
able<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.869> shoot<00:01:56.080> up<00:01:56.259> more<00:01:57.210> growths<00:01:58.210> and

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
able to shoot up more growths and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
able to shoot up more growths and
hopefully<00:01:58.750> it'll<00:01:58.899> stay<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.140> little<00:01:59.320> more

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
hopefully it'll stay a little more

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440 
hopefully it'll stay a little more
bushier<00:01:59.950> that's<00:02:00.580> kind<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.000> goal<00:02:01.149> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
bushier that's kind of the goal and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.419 
bushier that's kind of the goal and
aiming<00:02:01.720> for<00:02:01.899> here<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.289> don't<00:02:02.770> really<00:02:02.890> want<00:02:03.220> some

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
aiming for here I don't really want some

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.190 
aiming for here I don't really want some
big<00:02:03.640> long<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:05.800> know<00:02:05.920> tree<00:02:06.729> when<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.750> know<00:02:07.960> I'm

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
big long you know tree when I know I'm

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.620 
big long you know tree when I know I'm
going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.410> be<00:02:08.500> growing<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.860> indoors<00:02:09.630> probably

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
going to be growing it indoors probably

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.320 
going to be growing it indoors probably
about<00:02:10.780> half<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.200> time<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:13.060> watch

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
about half the time so I do watch

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.350 
about half the time so I do watch
through<00:02:13.830> push<00:02:14.830> out<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.250> bit<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:16.239> know

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
through push out a little bit you know

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.640 
through push out a little bit you know
keep<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:17.820> within<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.970> reasonable<00:02:19.350> width<00:02:20.350> but

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
keep it within a reasonable width but

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.770 
keep it within a reasonable width but
also<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.920> reasonable<00:02:21.370> height<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.930> I'll<00:02:23.200> start

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
also a reasonable height so I'll start

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.370 
also a reasonable height so I'll start
with<00:02:26.970> bring<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.120> back<00:02:28.450> quite<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.110> bit

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
with bring this back quite a bit

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.250 
with bring this back quite a bit
I<00:02:30.299> mean<00:02:31.299> if<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.750> different<00:02:32.079> time<00:02:32.230> of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
I mean if this is a different time of

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.630 
I mean if this is a different time of
year<00:02:32.530> I'd<00:02:32.680> probably<00:02:32.829> take<00:02:33.070> cuttings<00:02:33.310> off

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
year I'd probably take cuttings off

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.770 
year I'd probably take cuttings off
these<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.739> know<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.769> still<00:02:36.070> might<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.780> I'll

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
these you know I still might but I'll

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.100 
these you know I still might but I'll
think<00:02:37.930> about<00:02:38.049> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
think about it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.509 
think about it
also<00:02:42.299> putting<00:02:43.299> this<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> bit<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.400> way

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
also putting this a bit and the way

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.520 
also putting this a bit and the way
these<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.820> been<00:02:45.910> growing<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.450> don't<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.870> won't

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
these have been growing I don't I won't

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800 
these have been growing I don't I won't
be<00:02:47.620> surprised<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.250> front/back<00:02:48.540> two<00:02:49.540> months

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
be surprised to front/back two months

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.229 
be surprised to front/back two months
from<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:49.989> doing<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.470> again<00:02:50.769> but<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:52.120> know

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
from now doing this again but you know

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.420 
from now doing this again but you know
we'll<00:02:52.630> see<00:02:52.660> what<00:02:52.900> happens<00:02:53.380> I've<00:02:53.890> never<00:02:54.130> really

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
we'll see what happens I've never really

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.430 
we'll see what happens I've never really
done<00:02:54.579> this<00:02:54.610> before<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.590> we'll<00:02:56.590> see<00:02:56.799> whether

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
done this before so we'll see whether

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.830 
done this before so we'll see whether
it's<00:02:59.440> not<00:02:59.680> interesting

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.420 
cutting back a little bit of sort of
dead<00:03:36.720> raw<00:03:37.320> wood<00:03:37.740> there's<00:03:38.240> not<00:03:39.240> much<00:03:39.480> there<00:03:40.430> I'm

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
dead raw wood there's not much there I'm

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.710 
dead raw wood there's not much there I'm
not<00:03:41.610> sure<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:41.850> it's<00:03:41.940> really<00:03:42.150> bad<00:03:42.330> there's<00:03:42.600> just

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
not sure if it's really bad there's just

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.830 
not sure if it's really bad there's just
no<00:03:42.840> leaves<00:03:43.080> there<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.670> that's<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.660> think

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
no leaves there and that's it I think

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.330 
no leaves there and that's it I think
I'm<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:46.920> going<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.190> leave<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.370> at<00:03:47.490> this<00:03:49.340> this

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
I'm just going to leave it at this this

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.850 
I'm just going to leave it at this this
is<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> took<00:03:50.820> off<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.690> know<00:03:54.530> I'm<00:03:55.530> pretty

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
is what I took off you know I'm pretty

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.430 
is what I took off you know I'm pretty
sure<00:03:56.010> will<00:03:56.130> come<00:03:56.250> back<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:57.330> think<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.260> root

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
sure will come back I think the root

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.130 
sure will come back I think the root
system<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:58.920> definitely<00:03:59.040> healthy<00:04:00.110> when<00:04:01.110> I

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
system is definitely healthy when I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.470 
system is definitely healthy when I
water<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.460> roots<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:02.970> suck<00:04:03.180> up<00:04:03.210> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
water this the roots just suck up the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.390 
water this the roots just suck up the
water<00:04:03.860> really<00:04:04.860> fast<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:08.430> yes<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.360> it's

water really fast so yes I think it's

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.600 
water really fast so yes I think it's

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
what happens I think I think I'll have
