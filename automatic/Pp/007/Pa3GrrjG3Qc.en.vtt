00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 if you want to know more about the design here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.710
 down good on my channel I have another video 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.460
 where he explained the first impressions 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.010
 about this phone when we go to the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.450
 settings in the android version 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.840
 we found a 4.1.2 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 jelly beans 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.860
 how can you see 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.200
 good 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.099
 we will see social networks 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.830
 how do they behave personally? 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.830
 I had no problem do not see it 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.930
 good here we have facebook 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.050
 we see facebook 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.170
 as you can see there loads very fast 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.170
 images 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.610
 well that was facebook now we go with 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.610
 twitter 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.960
 that like facebook but the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.490
 perfection 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.040
 I have no problems 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.040
 the notifications reach me at the moment 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.760
 not like in other phones 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.560
 I've seen that it takes a bit or even 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.140
 change the time of publications and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.500
 that does not happen to me now we're going to 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.500
 instagram 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.380
 another one of the favorite social networks of 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.380
 everyone 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.250
 well here we have an instagram 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.250
 what else can I show 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.290
 in terms of navigation 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:59.370
 of course it's faster clearer not 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.370
 it is in the best 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.310
 but yes 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.310
 I'm pretty quick of things 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.450
 and the browser that comes by default 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.239
 here is com 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.290
 what else we have good 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.050
 calculator alarm settings and by 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.730
 of course I will show you the camera that is 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.030
 one of the strengths of this 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.030
 phone 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.030
 we can call him 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.560
 a skinny tuna 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.560
 disadvantage of his flash 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.340
 since it is not very bright as I thought 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.270
 but good is 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.270
 it's very good 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.810
 and here we see for example good here such 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.849
 it will not look good again for what I am 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.389
 recording 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.230
 but this photo is taken at 12 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.330
 megapixels 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:13.500
 and in the camera we can change 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:17.849
 the settings we have front camera 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.590
 and it's a photo effect that's stops 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:26.740
 when choosing the defect that you want 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:31.020
 I like this has a mobile interface 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.020
 very well very well achieved 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.630
 we have also 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.540
 and selection of scenes swept from 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.500
 panorama 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.960
 front camera video cameras 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.430
 and front videos 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.110
 well we switched to video mode 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.110
 to video mode we have 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.420
 also several modes 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.110
 here we have the adjustments 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.620
 what is video resolution we have it 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:20.070
 now full hd 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.070
 the microphone capture method 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.290
 and several other things 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:33.439
 then I will show how good play how much 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.439
 two moments of loading 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.699
 how can you see 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:54.210
 we have place tops 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.280
 and well I think it would be the whole review 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.240
 no, I do not focus very much on applications 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:03.340
 because you imagine that you already know 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.230
 android from head to toe 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.780
 single 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.240
 I wanted to show him the dream maybe a 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.680
 little of what they had not seen as the 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.840
 camera 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.410
 or social networks how do they work in this 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.410
 phone 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:24.760
 but well I would be all friends if 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.130
 they want some other video or if they want 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.840
 two videos a week comment here 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.210
 down 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:36.460
 I like it and subscribe 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.460
 is receiving with more content 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.740
 and if they want 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.310
 tomorrow I'll make a video of how 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.740
 use the studio dj application 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.300
 which is a mixer for android very 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.740
 good 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.780
 if you want, let me 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.120
 comments if I do it in this week 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.639
 and so I'll be coming up with two videos every 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.990
 week 

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:06.550
 so that we do not lose the habit 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:09.450
 and well it would not be all friends 

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.450
 I say goodbye 

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.870
 until next time
