00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.440 
you'll need some washi tape and a pair
of<00:01:08.400> scissors<00:01:12.409> I'm<00:01:13.790> cutting<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> washi<00:01:15.090> tape

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
of scissors I'm cutting the washi tape

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.539 
of scissors I'm cutting the washi tape
in<00:01:15.630> half<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.409> thinner<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.189> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
in half to make it thinner then it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:33.470 
in half to make it thinner then it's
time<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> create<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.390> diamond

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.210 

so<00:01:34.480> I<00:01:34.510> started<00:01:35.020> at<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.260> bottom<00:01:35.680> with<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.860> large

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
so I started at the bottom with a large

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.910 
so I started at the bottom with a large
v-shape<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.480> then<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:37.780> finished<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.530> outline

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
v-shape and then I finished the outline

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.220 
v-shape and then I finished the outline
at<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.190> top<00:01:39.430> just<00:01:40.390> kind<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.660> follow<00:01:40.900> along

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
at the top just kind of follow along

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.660 
at the top just kind of follow along
with<00:01:41.440> what<00:01:41.500> I'm<00:01:41.740> doing<00:01:41.770> on<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.340> screen

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
with what I'm doing on the screen

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.400 
with what I'm doing on the screen
because<00:01:43.180> it's<00:01:43.480> easier<00:01:43.870> for<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.260> actually

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
because it's easier for you to actually

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.830 
because it's easier for you to actually
see<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.280> then<00:01:45.610> for<00:01:45.850> me<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.150> explain<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.630> with

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
see that then for me to explain it with

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:57.090 
see that then for me to explain it with
a<00:01:46.870> bunch<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.350> confusing<00:01:47.979> words<00:01:55.860> once<00:01:56.860> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
a bunch of confusing words once the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.680 
a bunch of confusing words once the
shape<00:01:57.370> is<00:01:57.550> laid<00:01:57.790> out<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.180> can<00:01:58.330> tweak<00:01:58.660> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
shape is laid out you can tweak the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.810 
shape is laid out you can tweak the
layering<00:01:59.080> very<00:01:59.560> easily<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.280> get<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.640> look

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
layering very easily to get it to look

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.240
