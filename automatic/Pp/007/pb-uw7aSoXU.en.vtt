riders<00:00:03.389> review<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.929> want<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.140> talk<00:00:04.290> about<00:00:04.439> a

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
riders review and I want to talk about a

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.990 
riders review and I want to talk about a
board<00:00:04.859> I've<00:00:04.980> been<00:00:05.130> riding<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.670> month

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
board I've been riding for about a month

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.509 
board I've been riding for about a month
and<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.180> half<00:00:06.210> it's<00:00:06.960> been<00:00:07.080> an<00:00:07.290> insane<00:00:07.800> unreal

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
and a half it's been an insane unreal

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.600 
and a half it's been an insane unreal
board<00:00:08.910> far<00:00:09.900> above<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.680> expectations<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
board far above my expectations of it

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.460 
board far above my expectations of it
this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.330> considered<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.990> wide<00:00:13.170> board

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
this is considered a wide board

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.160 
this is considered a wide board
typically<00:00:13.800> for<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> short<00:00:14.340> board<00:00:15.170> dimensions

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
typically for the short board dimensions

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.109 
typically for the short board dimensions
so<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.439> is<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> hybrid<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.610> 20<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so this is a hybrid and this is 20 and a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.170 
so this is a hybrid and this is 20 and a
quarter<00:00:18.510> by<00:00:19.289> five<00:00:19.320> ten<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.610> is<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> five

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
quarter by five ten this one is a five

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380 
quarter by five ten this one is a five
six<00:00:21.570> twenty<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> quarter<00:00:22.830> by<00:00:23.190> two<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
six twenty two and a quarter by two and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.410 
six twenty two and a quarter by two and
five<00:00:24.810> eighths<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.230> believe<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.160> anyways<00:00:26.730> been

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
five eighths I believe but anyways been

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
five eighths I believe but anyways been
absolutely<00:00:27.990> an<00:00:28.260> amazing<00:00:28.740> board<00:00:29.220> I've<00:00:29.400> written

the<00:00:48.149> waves<00:00:48.299> are<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:48.600> big<00:00:48.839> it's<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.350> hard<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
the waves are so big it's just hard to

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.110 
the waves are so big it's just hard to
paddle<00:00:49.889> into<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> had<00:00:50.489> enough<00:00:50.699> volume<00:00:50.909> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
paddle into but I had enough volume the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.449 
paddle into but I had enough volume the
paddle<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.659> it<00:00:51.749> and<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.979> surprised<00:00:53.249> me<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:53.459 
paddle into it and what surprised me the

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:55.160 
paddle into it and what surprised me the
most<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.909> I<00:00:53.999> was<00:00:54.120> able<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.359> ride<00:00:54.569> it<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.839> real

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
most is I was able to ride it on a real

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.770 
most is I was able to ride it on a real
small<00:00:55.499> what<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.769> would<00:00:55.949> consider<00:00:56.069> typical

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
small what I would consider typical

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.299

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
waves on the inside so it just doubled

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140 
waves on the inside so it just doubled
my<00:01:07.170> wave<00:01:07.470> count<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.910> really

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
my wave count so I'm really really

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.000 
my wave count so I'm really really
impressed<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.870> excited<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.770> board

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
impressed and excited about this board

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.220

kind of a subtle rocker a little bit of
a<00:01:15.480> belly<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.200> too<00:01:16.410> much<00:01:17.180> sometimes<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a belly here not too much sometimes it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.610 
a belly here not too much sometimes it
was<00:01:18.480> too<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:18.690> belly<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> board<00:01:19.380> gets<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
was too much belly the board gets a

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
was too much belly the board gets a
little<00:01:19.770> sloppy<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:20.430> trying<00:01:20.550> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
little sloppy when you're trying to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.470 
little sloppy when you're trying to
paddle<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.140> single<00:01:22.140> concave<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.120> nice

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
paddle in single concave to a nice

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.090 
paddle in single concave to a nice
double<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> did<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.500> good<00:01:25.650> job<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
double you did a really good job on this

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.440 
double you did a really good job on this
double<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.730> then<00:01:26.850> he<00:01:26.940> combined<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.420> with

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
double and then he combined it with

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.350 
double and then he combined it with
these<00:01:27.660> pretty<00:01:28.500> rad<00:01:28.770> fins<00:01:29.100> kind<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> Gephardt

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
these pretty rad fins kind of a Gephardt

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.150 
these pretty rad fins kind of a Gephardt
foil<00:01:30.690> on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.230> front<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:31.620> things<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
foil on the front of these things and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.280 
foil on the front of these things and
then<00:01:32.250> he<00:01:32.400> did<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.550> cutaway<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:33.300> right

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then he did a cutaway on these right

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.190 
then he did a cutaway on these right
here<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.210> kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.270> releases<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.690> lot<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:36.990> water

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
here so kind of releases a lot of water

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.500 
here so kind of releases a lot of water
and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.550> magic<00:01:38.730> with<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.240> fins

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
and then I think the magic with the fins

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.420 
and then I think the magic with the fins
and<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.750> tail<00:01:39.810> combined<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.160> arc

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and the tail combined this arc

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.510 
and the tail combined this arc
Swallowtail<00:01:42.710> really<00:01:43.710> made<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.010> work<00:01:44.190> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
Swallowtail really made it work and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240 
Swallowtail really made it work and
perform<00:01:45.060> almost<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> short<00:01:46.770> board<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.130> mean

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
perform almost like a short board I mean

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.640 
perform almost like a short board I mean
it's<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.120> got<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> lot<00:01:48.630> more<00:01:48.659> volume<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
it's it's got a lot more volume but it's

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.330 
it's it's got a lot more volume but it's
shorter<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.960> worked<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.650> really<00:01:52.860> good

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
shorter and it worked really really good

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
shorter and it worked really really good
I've<00:01:53.640> never<00:01:54.240> never<00:01:54.630> had<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.870> problem<00:01:55.140> turning

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I've never never had a problem turning

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.340 
I've never never had a problem turning
it<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.940> even<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.570> big<00:01:57.780> surf<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.260> was

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
it and even in big surf when it was

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
it and even in big surf when it was
critical<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:59.370> thing<00:01:59.550> just<00:01:59.790> responds<00:02:00.720> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
critical this thing just responds to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.540 
critical this thing just responds to
everything<00:02:01.380> I've<00:02:01.530> been<00:02:01.800> able<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> give<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.400> I

longboard and they want to scale down

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.319 
longboard and they want to scale down
they<00:02:07.710> should<00:02:07.740> try<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.060> and
