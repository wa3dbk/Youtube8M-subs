00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.080
 to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.049
 today we are going to prepare a very delicious dessert 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.120
 colored gelatin and that we're going to 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.660
 need a glass of water 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 boiled a sachet of flavor gelatine a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.210
 glass of cold water and we will add the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.510
 neutral gelatin so you can grab 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.670
 consistency once the water boils it 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.680
 we will add this water to a bowl with the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.949
 flavor gelatin that we have in powder 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.530
 and we'll mix it up we'll split it up 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.899
 that is diluted completely after 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.910
 we will add coloring if we want 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.030
 apply some color especially in the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.610
 gelatin and last we will add a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.309
 dehydrated sheet in this case of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.590
 gelatine without flavor or failing 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.880
 also be neutral gelatin powder and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 with those simple steps 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.590
 we made our jelly 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.399
 Well, we have already returned from the kitchen and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.809
 we have our gelatin here 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.070
 prepared color 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.140
 simply prepare with the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.600
 instructions envelopes as 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.640
 indicates the manufacturer but we will apply 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.979
 about three sheets of neutral gelatin or 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.680
 unflavored gelatin for each sachet of 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.820
 colored gelatin that will give you more 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.650
 consistency and if we want we have 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.780
 dyes to make the amount of 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.180
 colors that we want to make according to our 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.149
 taste and our creativity and we will do 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.950
 now the final step of one of the layers 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.070
 of gelatin as you can see we already have 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.860
 some done and the only test will be 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.450
 that the top layer that we're going to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.729
 add the gelatin is consistent 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.119
 as you can see it is consistent and 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.780
 we can already add our last layer 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.780
 of gelatin 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.990
 with a little care that there is 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.020
 been a little bit cool 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.330
 and very carefully takes 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.570
 the fridge 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.310
 and when it is already curdled they will turn to 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.170
 place the following layers and so 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.990
 does with each of the layers of 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.180
 colors is simply very easy to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.580
 do but you have to do it with one with 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.400
 advance because each layer requires 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.670
 approximately 20 to 25 minutes of 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.980
 cooled and here you have these showy 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.110
 gelatins of very rich colors very 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 fresh on the palate and how you can see 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.570
 super colorful for any 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.570
 birthday
