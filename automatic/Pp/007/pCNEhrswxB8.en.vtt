00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
that damages normal ranges multi-lane

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.990 
that damages normal ranges multi-lane
and<00:01:06.900> recharge<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.140> pretty<00:01:08.380> quick<00:01:08.740> now<00:01:09.040> one<00:01:09.970> of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
and recharge is pretty quick now one of

and recharge is pretty quick now one of
the<00:01:10.119> things<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.570> you<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.079> understand<00:01:11.530> if

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
the things is you have to understand if

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.700 
the things is you have to understand if
you<00:01:11.950> use<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:13.390> probably<00:01:13.750> use<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.200> shoot<00:01:14.470> a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710

peashooter<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.400> lot<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.909> then<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.810> repeater<00:01:17.560> a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
peashooter a lot and then the repeater a

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.820 
peashooter a lot and then the repeater a
lot<00:01:18.010> they<00:01:18.850> all<00:01:19.000> shoot<00:01:19.300> in<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.540> single<00:01:19.960> lane<00:01:20.200> now

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
lot they all shoot in a single lane now

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.560 
lot they all shoot in a single lane now
the<00:01:20.890> problem<00:01:21.190> with<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.580> three<00:01:21.880> Peter<00:01:22.180> is<00:01:22.390> it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
the problem with the three Peter is it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.810 
the problem with the three Peter is it
doesn't<00:01:23.140> shoot<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.470> three<00:01:23.950> lanes<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.460> mean<00:01:24.729> it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
doesn't shoot in three lanes I mean it

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.640 
doesn't shoot in three lanes I mean it
doesn't<00:01:25.120> shoot<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.450> single<00:01:25.780> lane<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.110> shoots

doesn't shoot in a single lane it shoots

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.930 
doesn't shoot in a single lane it shoots
in<00:01:26.770> three<00:01:27.070> lanes<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:29.170> means<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:30.040> can<00:01:30.550> either

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
in three lanes that means it can either

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.320 
in three lanes that means it can either
be<00:01:31.920> weaker<00:01:32.920> or<00:01:33.100> stronger<00:01:33.520> depending<00:01:34.120> on<00:01:34.210> how

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
be weaker or stronger depending on how

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.260 
be weaker or stronger depending on how
you<00:01:34.390> play<00:01:34.720> now<00:01:35.620> what<00:01:36.550> happens<00:01:36.880> when<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.090> use<00:01:37.240> a
