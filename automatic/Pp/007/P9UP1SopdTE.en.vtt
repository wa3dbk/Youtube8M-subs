the<00:02:11.520> tippy-top

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
the tippy-top

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.180 
the tippy-top
it's<00:02:12.849> got<00:02:13.060> great<00:02:13.300> base<00:02:13.780> when<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.680> grade<00:02:14.980> them

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's got great base when we grade them

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.089 
it's got great base when we grade them
out<00:02:15.400> they<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:16.060> measure<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:17.050> low<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:17.830> noise

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
out they can measure very low for noise

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.190 
out they can measure very low for noise
and<00:02:19.379> micro<00:02:20.379> ffunny<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:22.300> trial<00:02:22.629> balance<00:02:23.080> I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
and micro ffunny and for trial balance I

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440 
and micro ffunny and for trial balance I
mean<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.980> try<00:02:24.760> balance<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.300> like

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
mean like this to try balance is like

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.860 
mean like this to try balance is like
within<00:02:25.660> 10%<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.239> we<00:02:28.239> got<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.599> stuff

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
within 10% so we got that stuff

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.390 
within 10% so we got that stuff
