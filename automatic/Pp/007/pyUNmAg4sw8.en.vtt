00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.870 

now<00:01:33.220> what<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.490> would<00:01:33.700> like<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.000> say<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.660> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
now what I would like to say is that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.980 
now what I would like to say is that
definitely<00:01:36.880> when<00:01:37.030> you're<00:01:37.150> idling<00:01:37.570> when

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
definitely when you're idling when

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.370 
definitely when you're idling when
you're<00:01:38.140> driving<00:01:38.530> around<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.970> pretty<00:01:40.180> much

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you're driving around it's pretty much

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.010 
you're driving around it's pretty much
silent<00:01:41.380> unless<00:01:41.710> you're<00:01:41.890> actually<00:01:42.040> on<00:01:42.370> your

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
silent unless you're actually on your

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020 
silent unless you're actually on your
accelerator<00:01:44.020> quite<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> bit<00:01:44.619> not<00:01:45.520> quite<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.790> bit

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
accelerator quite a bit not quite a bit

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.609 
accelerator quite a bit not quite a bit
but<00:01:46.210> once<00:01:46.540> you're<00:01:46.660> about<00:01:46.810> halfway<00:01:47.170> you'll

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
but once you're about halfway you'll

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.240 
but once you're about halfway you'll
start<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.979> hear<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.369> intake<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:51.070> quite

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
start to hear the intake it's quite

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.710 
start to hear the intake it's quite
enough<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.700> don't<00:01:51.880> hear<00:01:52.150> anything<00:01:52.420> when

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
enough so you don't hear anything when

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.810 
enough so you don't hear anything when
you're<00:01:52.840> actually<00:01:53.050> driving<00:01:53.650> around<00:01:54.040> but<00:01:54.700> it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
you're actually driving around but it's

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.060 
you're actually driving around but it's
also<00:01:55.030> loud<00:01:55.390> enough<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:56.020> definitely<00:01:56.800> turn<00:01:57.040> some

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
also loud enough to definitely turn some

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.560 
also loud enough to definitely turn some
heads<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.670> you're<00:01:57.820> driving<00:01:58.180> around<00:01:58.270> so

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
at about 15 percent acceleration and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.780
