00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.329
 hello and welcome to blogs point fr to continue to follow the 3 in 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.349
 live here in los angeles so as we could perhaps guess I 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.319
 am on the stand 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.069
 but a red head I could try the new golden scene bns 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.189
 which was highly anticipated and we already knew it was announced there is 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.949
 a long time ago there was a little missing and here it is we finally got 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.480
 play so been a little demo 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.360
 with two faces different phases of combat and a phase of adventure I 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.450
 started with the combat phase the least we can say in all 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.860
 case from the first steps in this fight is that it is beautiful these tests the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.840
 of course, but it's really very beautiful the effects of spells 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.690
 monsters animations all the scenery been floored really from the very high 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.170
 range for the ds and the interface itself maybe played at the level 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.570
 tactical or so hours with the tactical cross at the tactical level 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.350
 weber 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.140
 certainly you have a small menu at the bottom 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.330
 for his excesses actions stupidly attack magic and so on for 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.540
 100 euros you can either manipulated with the directional cross or with 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.560
 the stylus and even with the know we can also move like that a little bit the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.860
 3d camera view for them not have a better perception of the terrain this 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 that does not change much of its traditional light supply 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.110
 that is to say that each of the characters of your team will attack the monsois 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.880
 turn after you have selected the actions you 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.130
 desire to do so especially the attacked and it is actually the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.350
 spells that are different according to the characters with multiple classes 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.330
 and elementary schools a little bit classic and percent jeans then 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.350
 the jeans have soothed these two little creatures that have some 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.619
 capacity a little bit is not average it smells a little palace in 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.490
 cassation except that it just allows you to cast more powerful spells red and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 by once we cast a powerful spell and so the jeans are a 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.490
 a bit 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.290
 in a particular state we will be able to beauty is launched the famous 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.500
 true invocations with kinematics takes place on both screens which is 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.330
 very impressive the second phase the adventure mix can now a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.539
 little bit of classic rpg aspect we will not talk to all the characters 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.160
 know the objects et cetera et cetera as you can have in rpg 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.220
 classic and then detours days santi little more to zelda with 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.989
 puzzles and all a little madoff other things 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.720
 especially special abilities that have to be given by the factories 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.999
 during the modest reassuring 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.219
 and that is played with the trigger buttons for example I have an object or 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:23.120
 well he grow grass and this art deputy dp not quot that dependent 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.269
 function of the jeans that are with your characters that lends you or what we have 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.699
 could see for om mention this new code does not ring 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.729
 e history is 30 years after the second we do not know more about 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.059
 the moment but in all cases visually it's very promising and 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.379
 at the level of the gameplay there are a lot of ideas 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.989
 I'll tell you more when we'll play a bit longer after 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.690
 believe all the cases for the moment there are a lot of other players right 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.400
 so we will not hang out I leave you for the moment see you soon on gameblog 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.050
 late
