example when you have the clocks in the

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.359 
example when you have the clocks in the
off<00:00:18.849> position<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:20.140> functions<00:00:20.560> as<00:00:20.769> a<00:00:20.859> normal

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
off position it functions as a normal

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.639 
off position it functions as a normal
cage<00:00:21.579> wood<00:00:21.849> and<00:00:22.119> moves<00:00:22.329> back<00:00:22.449> before<00:00:22.929> in<00:00:23.199> the

bearing<00:00:26.649> unit<00:00:26.739> inside<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.369> clutch<00:00:27.699> that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
bearing unit inside the clutch that

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.639 
bearing unit inside the clutch that
provides<00:00:28.359> resistance<00:00:28.689> to<00:00:29.079> the<00:00:29.169> cage<00:00:29.349> so<00:00:29.559> you

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
provides resistance to the cage so you

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.290 
provides resistance to the cage so you
can<00:00:29.739> see<00:00:29.859> it's<00:00:30.009> a<00:00:30.039> lot<00:00:30.279> harder<00:00:30.669> to<00:00:30.999> move<00:00:31.089> that

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
can see it's a lot harder to move that

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.600 
can see it's a lot harder to move that
cage<00:00:31.509> which<00:00:31.989> controls<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.590> chain<00:00:33.190> tension

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
cage which controls the chain tension

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.550 
cage which controls the chain tension
and<00:00:33.850> reduces<00:00:34.210> chain<00:00:34.390> /<00:00:34.600> so<00:00:35.050> we'll<00:00:35.170> quickly<00:00:35.350> get

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
and reduces chain / so we'll quickly get

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:51.530 
and reduces chain / so we'll quickly get
into<00:00:35.680> this<00:00:35.830> thing

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.440 

yes

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.639 

and<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.690> first<00:00:55.899> thing<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.140> want<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.320> be<00:00:56.410> aware

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
and the first thing you want to be aware

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.010 
and the first thing you want to be aware
of<00:00:56.710> when<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.520> remove<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.910> cover<00:00:58.120> is<00:00:58.720> that<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
of when you remove the cover is that the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.530 
of when you remove the cover is that the
unit<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.410> sealed<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.950> that<00:01:00.579> seal<00:01:00.879> may<00:01:01.270> or<00:01:01.329> may

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
unit is sealed and that seal may or may

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.940 
unit is sealed and that seal may or may
not<00:01:01.570> come<00:01:01.960> up<00:01:02.079> with<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.290> cover<00:01:02.500> but<00:01:02.650> you<00:01:02.770> don't

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
not come up with the cover but you don't

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.009 
not come up with the cover but you don't
want<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.160> lose<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.400> seal<00:01:03.879> because<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.900> will

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
want to lose that seal because that will

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.480 
want to lose that seal because that will
allow<00:01:05.260> water<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.740> other<00:01:05.830> contaminants<00:01:06.130> into

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
allow water and other contaminants into

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.890 
allow water and other contaminants into
the<00:01:06.610> system<00:01:06.940> so<00:01:07.150> I'll<00:01:07.240> lift<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.510> up<00:01:07.600> in<00:01:07.780> that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
the system so I'll lift it up in that

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.140 
the system so I'll lift it up in that
case<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.290> seal<00:01:08.530> stayed<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.670> it's<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.090> little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
case the seal stayed in it's a little

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.640 
case the seal stayed in it's a little
sleeve<00:01:10.509> right<00:01:10.720> there<00:01:10.930> but<00:01:11.110> sometimes<00:01:11.500> it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
sleeve right there but sometimes it

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.960 
sleeve right there but sometimes it
looks<00:01:11.740> up<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.070> pulls<00:01:12.280> out<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.729> want<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:12.910> be

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
looks up and pulls out so you want to be

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.330 
looks up and pulls out so you want to be
aware<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.240> them<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:14.140> on<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> HTR<00:01:14.740> mechanism

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
aware of them so on the HTR mechanism

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.240 
aware of them so on the HTR mechanism
the<00:01:15.820> tool<00:01:16.090> necessary<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:17.050> adjust<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.830> tension

is to show you how this clutch works if

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.109 
is to show you how this clutch works if
this<00:01:52.630> band<00:01:52.990> right<00:01:53.320> here<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.950> pinches<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.729> B

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
this band right here that pinches the B

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.540 
this band right here that pinches the B
knuckle<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:56.200> more<00:01:56.470> attention<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:57.160> put

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
knuckle and the more attention you put

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.609 
knuckle and the more attention you put
on<00:01:57.759> that<00:01:57.880> band<00:01:58.209> the<00:01:58.660> tighter<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.289> pinches

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
on that band the tighter that pinches

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.350 
on that band the tighter that pinches
the<00:01:59.679> B<00:01:59.890> knuckle<00:02:00.280> which<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.700> turn<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.060> tighter

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
the B knuckle which in turn in tighter

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.050 
the B knuckle which in turn in tighter
pinches<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:01.929> bearings<00:02:02.380> adding<00:02:03.069> more<00:02:03.280> tension

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
pinches the bearings adding more tension

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.699 
pinches the bearings adding more tension
in<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.360> clutch<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:05.170> can<00:02:05.319> see<00:02:05.500> how<00:02:05.560> that

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
in the clutch and you can see how that

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.270 
in the clutch and you can see how that
works<00:02:05.920> when<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.520> flip<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.970> switch<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.599> can

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
works when you flip the switch I can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.520 
works when you flip the switch I can
mechanism<00:02:09.420> pushes<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:10.539> against<00:02:10.959> those<00:02:11.290> two

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
mechanism pushes up against those two

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.430 
mechanism pushes up against those two
prongs<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.280> engages<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> clutch<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:14.290> like

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
prongs and engages the clutch just like

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
prongs and engages the clutch just like
that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.320 
that
so<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:15.990> our<00:02:16.080> tool<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.880> adjust<00:02:18.180> this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
so with our tool here we can adjust this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
so with our tool here we can adjust this
nut<00:02:18.540> which<00:02:19.349> again<00:02:19.590> will<00:02:20.190> adjust<00:02:20.430> how<00:02:20.700> much

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
nut which again will adjust how much

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.790 
nut which again will adjust how much
tension<00:02:21.209> we're<00:02:21.630> putting<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.170> those<00:02:22.349> problems

not very much and from there again you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.320 
not very much and from there again you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
can go lower if you don't want as much

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.140

to go any higher than that otherwise you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.979 
to go any higher than that otherwise you
will<00:02:43.620> over<00:02:44.190> torque<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> unit<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.810> could

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
will over torque the unit and you could

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.199 
will over torque the unit and you could
potentially<00:02:46.380> break<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.819> for<00:02:48.090> the
