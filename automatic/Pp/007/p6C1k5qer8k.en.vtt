my<00:00:15.520> music<00:00:15.850> is<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.930> fusion<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.590> information

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
my music is the fusion of information

itself to problem-solving with the kind
of<00:00:35.740> music<00:00:35.829> that<00:00:36.040> I<00:00:36.160> do<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.520> attack<00:00:37.300> those<00:00:37.600> pieces

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
of music that I do I attack those pieces

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.570 
of music that I do I attack those pieces
the<00:00:38.200> same<00:00:38.410> way<00:00:38.560> that<00:00:38.710> I<00:00:38.770> might<00:00:38.980> attack<00:00:39.310> like<00:00:39.520> a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
the same way that I might attack like a

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.930 
the same way that I might attack like a
project<00:00:39.940> plan<00:00:40.860> sort<00:00:41.860> of<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.100> know<00:00:42.220> going<00:00:42.640> from

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
project plan sort of you know going from

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.960 
project plan sort of you know going from
making<00:00:43.840> a<00:00:43.870> little<00:00:44.050> prototype<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.700> I<00:00:45.790> make

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
making a little prototype like I make

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.910 
making a little prototype like I make
little<00:00:46.120> song<00:00:46.840> prototypes<00:00:47.350> where<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.560> test<00:00:47.800> an

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
little song prototypes where I test an

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.040 
little song prototypes where I test an
idea<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.400> then<00:00:48.850> I<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.300> know<00:00:49.420> build<00:00:49.870> more

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
idea and then I you know build more

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.110 
idea and then I you know build more
functionality<00:00:50.590> into<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:50.920> until<00:00:51.130> eventually<00:00:51.820> I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
functionality into it until eventually I

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.390 
functionality into it until eventually I
have<00:00:52.300> an<00:00:52.390> entire<00:00:52.630> piece<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.930> music<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:53.380> then<00:00:53.860> I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
have an entire piece of music and then I

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.430 
have an entire piece of music and then I
have<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.330> try<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.510> do<00:00:55.720> everything<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:56.230> can<00:00:56.290> to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
have to try to do everything I can to

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.380 
have to try to do everything I can to
make<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.800> function<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.460> make<00:00:57.700> it<00:00:57.790> scalable<00:00:58.060> so

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
make it function and make it scalable so

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.510 
make it function and make it scalable so
that<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.570> can<00:00:58.660> bring<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:58.870> on<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.050> work

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
that it can bring it on to work

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:26.360 
that it can bring it on to work

when<00:01:27.370> I<00:01:27.400> construct<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.880> piece<00:01:28.090> it's<00:01:28.690> made<00:01:28.930> up<00:01:29.050> of

when I construct a piece it's made up of

when I construct a piece it's made up of
these<00:01:29.380> little<00:01:29.800> small<00:01:29.980> building<00:01:30.490> blocks<00:01:30.730> and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
these little small building blocks and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.150 
these little small building blocks and
you<00:01:31.330> have<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.570> organize<00:01:31.720> them<00:01:32.230> into<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.010> piece

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
you have to organize them into a piece

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.010 
you have to organize them into a piece
of<00:01:33.280> music<00:01:33.550> like<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.210> piece<00:01:34.480> of<00:01:34.510> information

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020

with<00:01:35.170> metadata<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:36.220> same<00:01:36.400> thing<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.670> true<00:01:36.940> for

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
with metadata the same thing is true for

like<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> musical<00:01:38.560> phrase<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:39.010> really<00:01:39.400> like<00:01:39.580> to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
like a musical phrase I really like to

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.370 
like a musical phrase I really like to
be<00:01:39.940> able<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.270> pick<00:01:40.480> out<00:01:40.600> every<00:01:40.960> single<00:01:41.140> little

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
be able to pick out every single little

be able to pick out every single little
sound<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.010> can<00:01:42.040> say<00:01:42.280> oh<00:01:42.430> yeah<00:01:42.640> that's<00:01:43.120> a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
sound and you can say oh yeah that's a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.140 
sound and you can say oh yeah that's a
plug<00:01:43.420> or<00:01:43.960> oh<00:01:44.020> that's<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.410> tap<00:01:44.620> or<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:46.000> a

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.940 
plug or oh that's a tap or that's a
harmonic<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:47.350> really<00:01:47.560> neat<00:01:47.740> when<00:01:47.830> you

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
harmonic and it's really neat when you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.200 
harmonic and it's really neat when you
build<00:01:48.130> up<00:01:48.250> all<00:01:48.370> these<00:01:48.490> little<00:01:48.640> small<00:01:48.820> things

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
build up all these little small things

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.090 
build up all these little small things
that<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:49.750> make<00:01:49.930> something<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:50.800> is<00:01:50.920> like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
that you can make something that is like

don't actually write any music down I
