So today, I'm going to show you how Instagram works.

The interesting thing about doing Instagram for me, 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is that I get to take pictures of the world as it sort of goes by,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.250
or of places that I go - 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.750
You know, little pictures of work or whatever,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750
