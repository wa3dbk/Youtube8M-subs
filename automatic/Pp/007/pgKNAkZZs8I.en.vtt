00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
specimens that grows here by itself

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.540 
specimens that grows here by itself
which<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.310> ninth<00:00:17.880> footer<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:19.550> two

which was about ninth footer and two
years<00:00:20.699> ago<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.910> cut<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.740> about<00:00:22.740> four<00:00:23.640> feet

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
years ago I cut it into about four feet

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.320 
years ago I cut it into about four feet
and<00:00:25.310> today<00:00:26.310> I'm<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.699> reduce<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> a

and today I'm going to reduce it a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:43.000 
and today I'm going to reduce it a
little<00:00:27.480> bit<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:29.000> here<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.090> go

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.920 

selecting<00:00:43.910> points<00:00:44.900> what<00:00:45.710> I<00:00:45.740> want<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.220> cut<00:00:46.930> just

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.610 

so<00:01:19.510> at<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:19.900> point<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:21.520> little<00:01:22.620> growing

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
so at this point this little growing

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.150 
so at this point this little growing
tree<00:01:23.950> has<00:01:24.190> good<00:01:25.030> starting<00:01:25.600> branches<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:27.070> the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
tree has good starting branches for the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.000 
tree has good starting branches for the
future<00:01:30.060> location<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.690> branches<00:01:32.370> bonsai

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
future location of the branches bonsai

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.800 
future location of the branches bonsai
use<00:01:36.010> them<00:01:36.190> I'm<00:01:36.670> gonna<00:01:36.820> let<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.120> grow<00:01:37.330> like<00:01:37.570> this

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
use them I'm gonna let it grow like this

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.190 
use them I'm gonna let it grow like this
for<00:01:38.200> about<00:01:38.729> two<00:01:39.729> more<00:01:39.880> years<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:40.900> get<00:01:41.170> a

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
for about two more years so I can get a

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.820 
for about two more years so I can get a
good<00:01:41.410> curse<00:01:41.710> on<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.210> trunk<00:01:43.440> which<00:01:44.440> is<00:01:44.590> already

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
good curse on the trunk which is already

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.480 
good curse on the trunk which is already
about<00:01:45.070> four<00:01:45.370> inches<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.950> I'll<00:01:48.100> dig<00:01:48.370> it

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
about four inches and then I'll dig it

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.990 
about four inches and then I'll dig it
out<00:01:48.550> into<00:01:49.030> another<00:01:49.870> pot<00:01:50.460> leave<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.790> for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
out into another pot leave it there for

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.690 
out into another pot leave it there for
another<00:01:52.150> two<00:01:52.420> years<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.220> roots<00:01:54.430> can<00:01:54.670> be

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
another two years so the roots can be

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.230 
another two years so the roots can be
established<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:57.509> I'll<00:01:58.509> plant<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.170> into<00:01:59.590> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
established and I'll plant it into a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.570 
established and I'll plant it into a
nice<00:02:01.240> bonsai<00:02:01.869> pot<00:02:02.110> later<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.540> later
