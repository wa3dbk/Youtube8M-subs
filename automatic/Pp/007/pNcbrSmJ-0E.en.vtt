and I'm just going to continue doing
that<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> way<00:03:11.430> across<00:03:12.440> usually<00:03:13.440> have

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that all the way across usually have

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.730 
that all the way across usually have
this<00:03:13.770> just<00:03:14.010> kind<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.490> my<00:03:14.670> lap<00:03:15.230> or<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:18.810> like

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
this just kind of on my lap or on a like

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.860 
this just kind of on my lap or on a like
a<00:03:19.770> pillow<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.280> something<00:03:20.490> on<00:03:21.120> my<00:03:21.300> lap<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
a pillow or something on my lap and I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.870 
a pillow or something on my lap and I
usually<00:03:22.020> just<00:03:22.320> sit<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.710> and<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.520> on<00:03:23.760> my

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
usually just sit and and do this on my

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.650 
usually just sit and and do this on my
lap<00:03:25.070> alright<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.340> now<00:03:26.490> I'm<00:03:26.610> back<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.880> one<00:03:27.540> of

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
lap alright so now I'm back to one of

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.300 
lap alright so now I'm back to one of
the<00:03:27.750> knitted<00:03:28.280> sections<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:31.770> can<00:03:31.950> kind<00:03:32.220> of

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the knitted sections and you can kind of

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.920 
the knitted sections and you can kind of
see<00:03:32.640> how<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.000> doing<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.690> I'm<00:03:33.780> going<00:03:33.900> to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
see how I'm doing here so I'm going to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:45.290 
see how I'm doing here so I'm going to
go<00:03:34.050> under<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.650> V<00:03:38.060> back<00:03:39.060> down<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.810> over<00:03:44.150> go<00:03:45.150> up

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
go under the V back down and over go up

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.570 
go under the V back down and over go up
here<00:03:45.950> where<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:46.980> V<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:49.130> see<00:03:50.130> how<00:03:50.370> that's

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
here where the V you see how that's

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.420 
here where the V you see how that's
forming<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.180> nice<00:03:53.150> edge<00:03:54.150> there<00:03:55.400> nice<00:03:56.400> and

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
forming that nice edge there nice and

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:10.370 
forming that nice edge there nice and
clean

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.650 

and<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.430> looks<00:04:11.640> kind<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.880> uneven<00:04:12.270> but<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.510> have

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
and it looks kind of uneven but you have

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.120 
and it looks kind of uneven but you have
these<00:04:12.870> pearl<00:04:13.200> ridges<00:04:13.680> here<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.400> are<00:04:14.550> kind<00:04:14.820> of

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
these pearl ridges here that are kind of

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.199 
these pearl ridges here that are kind of
intermittent<00:04:17.130> going<00:04:17.550> across<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.209> that's<00:04:18.390> why

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
intermittent going across so that's why

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.290 
intermittent going across so that's why
all<00:04:21.209> right<00:04:21.860> and<00:04:22.860> that's<00:04:23.700> basically<00:04:24.120> what

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
all right and that's basically what

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.430 
all right and that's basically what
you're<00:04:24.420> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.600> do<00:04:24.720> all<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> way<00:04:25.170> across

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you're going to do all the way across

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.830 
you're going to do all the way across
and<00:04:25.560> you're<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.250> going<00:04:26.550> you're<00:04:27.210> going<00:04:27.360> under

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
and you're just going you're going under

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.410 
and you're just going you're going under
the<00:04:28.590> V<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.480> top<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.790> then<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.120> go<00:04:33.240> back

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
the V on the top and then you go back

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.120 
the V on the top and then you go back
into<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.870> same<00:04:34.080> place<00:04:34.260> where<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.620> came<00:04:34.740> up<00:04:34.800> on

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
into the same place where you came up on

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.450 
into the same place where you came up on
the<00:04:35.280> bottom<00:04:35.670> scoot<00:04:36.330> over<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.690> stitch<00:04:37.250> then<00:04:38.250> you

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
the bottom scoot over a stitch then you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
the bottom scoot over a stitch then you
go<00:04:38.610> under<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.150> V<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.610> one<00:04:41.820> stitch<00:04:42.180> that's

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
go under the V of that one stitch that's

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.560 
go under the V of that one stitch that's
two<00:04:42.840> little<00:04:43.790> loops<00:04:44.790> of<00:04:45.120> yarn<00:04:45.390> there<00:04:47.420> you<00:04:48.420> just

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
two little loops of yarn there you just

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.110 
two little loops of yarn there you just
keep<00:04:48.840> doing<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.140> all<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.410> way<00:04:49.620> across<00:04:49.860> so

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.830 

that's<00:04:54.120> how<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.420> do<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.890> cast<00:04:56.160> on<00:04:56.840> edge

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
that's how you do the the cast on edge

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.660 
that's how you do the the cast on edge
from<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.200> square<00:04:58.440> above<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.250> bound<00:04:59.430> off

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
from the square above to the bound off

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.690 
from the square above to the bound off
edge<00:04:59.700> on<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.870> square<00:05:01.260> weave<00:05:02.010> in<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.310> ends<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
edge on the square weave in the ends the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.360 
edge on the square weave in the ends the
same<00:05:02.940> way<00:05:03.150> going<00:05:03.930> across<00:05:04.200> all<00:05:05.010> right<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.220> hope

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
same way going across all right I hope

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.150 
same way going across all right I hope
that<00:05:05.580> helps<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.820> little<00:05:05.940> bit
