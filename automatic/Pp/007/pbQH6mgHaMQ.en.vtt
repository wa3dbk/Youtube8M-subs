00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.600
 welcome to the villa mata 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.900
 Today we ice one in the Carmel 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.130
 with cream and to do it we follow 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.640
 the wonderfully fresh raspberries and 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.740
 season summer, of course, gorgeous 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.650
 son but sweet the pure me 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.759
 Of course, then go through juice without the juice 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.980
 Corner them to me 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.429
 then we make a caramel one 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.599
 cream caramel where we even natural 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.039
 caramelize 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.860
 medisana on lock the whole one 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.180
 a bit of a puzzle like sugar say 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.430
 relationship is give a taste 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.250
 a little bit of water up and then sky 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.020
 the whole place easily under the sky 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 silver market what we then afterwards 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 bring freeze I mean the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.030
 always go 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.420
 while we puree the raspberries 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:01:04.009
 we can already the same time 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:06.229
 make caramel as well as give it 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.610
 brown sugar brown sugar for 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.890
 Caramelizing is simply better 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.420
 uniform and robust aroma and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.420
 Of course that hides the caramel 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 so we go well the living 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.010
 covered in the pot and let 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.659
 The whole glassy then we look 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.940
 the grief brownish becomes the fastest 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.920
 looked down while it takes us of course 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.640
 There never again and puree these beautiful 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.640
 fall through 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.860
 the caramel needs a little something like that 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.160
 23 minutes due to the large amount 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.570
 have the sugar placed therein 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.370
 and when we realize the caramel is 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.930
 slowly liquid is slightly brown 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.420
 consistently has the crystalline 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.490
 we can lose viscosity during 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:09.679
 first lie in the snow men 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:17.570
 Then we give a nice one 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:20.570
 strong shot cream and let 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.350
 the whole take all the knowledge of 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.860
 loosen soil 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.350
 that slows down too much on his art 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.840
 get rid of caramel a bit of water 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.300
 Let's add the sugar 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.520
 the ml cream is not received 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.520
 tastes too strong after being burnt 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:56.230
 which thereby so that we cores 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:03:00.520
 The juice is so nice outside 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.890
 squeeze out the full aroma 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 have so little of the caramel of sugar 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:19.030
 has slowly dissolved and a beautiful 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:24.420
 mass has arisen when we do the whole thing 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.420
 carefully into the passed raspberries 1 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.540
 I was then due to the saane on the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.090
 The whole thing will have happened 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.790
 of course courageous because I do not like that 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.940
 strong dark and red and fruity like 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:49.780
 the zombies but little whitish 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:54.459
 so now we give it all when it's nice 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.940
 creamy is sweeter than wanted the 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.940
 ice cream machine 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.970
 and let it freeze that takes about 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.540
 20 minutes and then I would say 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.160
 that is, after that finished 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.320
 the ice only in the ice cream maker vigorously 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.669
 froze from here I would say that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.050
 is finished chilli con sens and then 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.430
 The whole thing would have to spoon because 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.169
 hot water of course that's me 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.910
 whole triggers goes out again bit 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.910
 chocolate or coffee chocolate and 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:51.800
 maybe the whole thing, too 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:55.130
 also like a situation very short fmrt 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.130
 actively important
