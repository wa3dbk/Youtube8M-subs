00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:11.759
 I wait for the shot more said nothing 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.440
 perfect is the most straight ok then it is 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 all Berisa boys and girls well 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.070
 top plus your max today 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.140
 we will do a boxing on turtle beach px 21 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.720
 so random because I took them today 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 send it back boxing then first of all 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.599
 Cutter immediately turns when you use the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.719
 scissors the rounded tip are 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.630
 cut out is not true yes but then details 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 but it does not therefore cut how to finish it 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.290
 sorry but you will be a song first 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.460
 what do you do before you do that cool 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.600
 a cutter to cut thrust 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 however there is to say these headphones go 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.640
 well they were designed for ps time 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 but go well both for it is turned off and for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 pc because they have all the attacks 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:08.400
 April specials for opposites why 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 however, they are because on open the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 suicide 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 however for a box we then have the ci 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.509
 he wanted to be here then to say that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.090
 We have no few hours what it's 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.330
 this is already a very good record of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.270
 installation I imagine or not is the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.640
 completely useless manual via ha 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.070
 caught fire 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.070
 so much the beach then here we have things 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.070
 support 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.220
 another plastic support that if 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.600
 care here what is that the beautiful they wary 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.210
 a year the part here and see in one 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.930
 kind of sponge that are very comfortable 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.120
 xl atx and that is where the pavilion is 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.670
 much more comfortable and comfortable than 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.140
 to those the former the asp that I always have there of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.200
 a fund that go behind because that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.690
 that I have split so be it 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.780
 that is, the audio jack no longer works 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.020
 so wounds I can't talk without 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.100
 nymph brand instead we have two cables 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.100
 let's do some order 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 this is the cable that lies to me 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.580
 will connect the xbox this 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.450
 they stick around here was a certain point 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.730
 the cable 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.910
 after you do it they stick here 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.630
 behind and then I will stick between tv and 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.210
 will work is this instead of the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.700
 end attaches the decline in saying 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.450
 precisely this is done so and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.970
 then these remarkable hummingbirds work 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.890
 this one serves for the jack for the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.810
 xbox command for works from that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.400
 thank you so much 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.830
 practically this 4 goes here 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.870
 behind here where is the map of the xbox e 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.489
 then this other framework attached to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.270
 attach it over the headphones is expected 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.620
 however in the end everything for good 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.180
 very well on these headphones as like 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.890
 cabbage the break that the Venetian passes 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.680
 excuse a wall command I imagine face 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.480
 discharge as a tissue as a cardboard 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.480
 fuck did the cardboard here 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:33.390
 claudia the remote control maybe work 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:40.460
 signed this moment I apologize 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:42.990
 well sorry but it doesn't mean me 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:49.280
 that in order to remove it by force it breaks at 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:52.170
 box does not expect I succeeded 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.050
 then we practically enjoyed it here 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.870
 a snake the headphones that are 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.490
 adjustable in every way 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.780
 doing so the directional microphone 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.630
 forward ok now let's see everything 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.550
 how it is assembled and seen from above 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.520
 in short, we see better quality 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.150
 of our px 21 with microphone 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.580
 the investment is directional 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.950
 common so very comfortable and here they are 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.000
 equally comfortable compared to the former one 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.970
 and the charges after I show them 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.890
 which is not even that community then see 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.450
 which cost 30 euros 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.850
 from here we have as I said before the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.800
 remotes or is we practically have 40 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.560
 for the cloud rick box that now you 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.970
 I take a moment in this is a 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.920
 moment that I suffered it because I have 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.830
 always denied these things that I am 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.590
 getting used to so i'm hosting i know 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.730
 inhabiting you feel like i always say fuck the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.730
 system and I do so 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.240
 here then I saw nothing and won 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.849
 practically this almost attacks the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.930
 this picture attaches here others 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:10.590
 they command this instead it must be attacked 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.190
 to the maneuver that the saber is ok if that 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.470
 the quarry then remains the setting 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.930
 for rick fox for feet for ps3 I don't know 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.190
 how it works mind tennis player but has 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.830
 however written in this manual 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.080
 useless that fire even if it is me 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.610
 it was useful since some point not 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 understand they were put 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.210
 anyway this one does both as far as 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.520
 concerns PCs from both files and microphone 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.979
 let it be from that to hear how 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.349
 headphones anyway for playing greet 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.940
 box should be attacked back here like this 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.919
 and then this as the gap attached 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.840
 to the component if you don't have it 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.030
 obvious order of the speaker that 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.190
 it is like that it is other hours anyway 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.270
 which must be attached to the scart and then 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.949
 even worse hdmi 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.069
 if you don't necessarily see the component 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.250
 with the scart and therefore nothing 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.659
 the usb cable for the power supply that 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.729
 they would have been fed were paid or to 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.370
 xbox or computer to power only 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.560
 all the boys and girls work and 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.900
 girls well found in this test of the 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.810
 Microphone then a test which of the 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.310
 microphone of the turtle beach px 21 e 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.289
 no guys i have to say he got me 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.330
 really surprised like a pair of headphones 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.490
 I paid 70 euros for slow boys 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.400
 or euro this year 70 euros up 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.219
 gamestop the priest 50 thanks to some 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.900
 I play the product behind for which I have to 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:37.380
 say that as a microphone really 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.690
 guys is really very good quality 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.759
 crystalline both in feel and in like 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.380
 microphone in fact but the most beautiful thing 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.460
 guys who are also very versatile 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.909
 so they are fine on ps3 on xbox 360 and 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.800
 also on pc and mac and I think they go 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:55.139
 also good for xbox one without further 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.210
 dancers but it is not substitute and they are not 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.130
 sure not on ps4 sure that not 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.259
 they work without any splitters but 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.180
 however they are details here inter agazzi 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.800
 for this video it's all so there 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.150
