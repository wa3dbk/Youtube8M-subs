00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.840
 hello friends canary hello friends 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.470
 tempered today I'm going to teach 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.900
 how will I pocket what I went 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.800
 again but here we have it 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.460
 4 page 11 with a lot of quality 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.980
 we give it a little there until when 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.190
 we give the other one to watch the other videos what 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.340
 explain 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.860
 we will give you have not filled : 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.560
 never without giving him we see the neck 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.110
 to see if we can see it does not release the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.650
 syringe 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.960
 We believe that the neck as it has not been 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.780
 full of porridge this would be the most 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.300
 that we can give for example this what 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.670
 we see and it does not have any food in it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.699
 ground 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.829
 we see it there true because this would have to 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.739
 give it already what is associated by 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.350
 example this after this has no food 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.030
 we give you what you do not always have because 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.030
 they do not have them ever undo 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:16.430
 and we see by airbus outside is already 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.430
 finished and I have this one here 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.000
 this one here 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 to the full and now we see everything that 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.390
 they have the full crop 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.990
 If everything has a full craw all four 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 million and me although I have the mouth 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.180
 open 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.210
 look how to have a craw are all fed up 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.729
 of commerce was that I enter this 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.149
 porridge that I give you have probiotics 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:53.049
 and he does it and medicine that does not 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.049
 dies he anointed him this here the cer and not 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.100
 would be part of the series that is coming 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.420
 they have damaged this 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.590
 if you do not have the partridge breeding 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.590
 I was in the breeding 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 but I give them this special believed this 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.489
 comes without a brand that comes antibiotics and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.099
 vitamins for with amino acid for 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.370
 small for the little ones and this is very 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.740
 good and I add it and according to the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.890
 indication and you do not move or a chicken 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.110
 the recommendation that I give if we see that 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.520
 Canarian has a full crop 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.250
 channels have small straws 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.380
 he has a full crop not to give him not to give 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.600
 because that's what the mother gives them but 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.760
 always give him in the morning when he 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.250
 lift and last is now before 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.740
 sleep 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.990
 what is half past four already 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.870
 It's night here at six thirty and 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.700
 why are you all telling me to try it 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.200
 annoying because if you understand the light 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.260
 at night very annoying and that's why what 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.580
 she is here karma milestone and now they have 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.540
 gone with the mother 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.690
 We will look here 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.430
 I put it before 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.370
 in his nest I have everything prepared 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.400
 when the young 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.010
 although I can 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.890
 one with double this to put it and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.409
 here we have from while some locks 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.060
 two sites and the rapids and it gives me time 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.780
 rubber wire all the prisons that 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.909
 I have in the aviary but make impossible 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.579
 one by one running it inside though 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.129
 comes the most recommended nest 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.950
 inside or outside but well I would 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.890
 I use for convenience and for now 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.629
 it's worth a lot today you have doubts write by 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.950
 down here or even another friend from 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.430
 canary to another friend of the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.430
 seeded
