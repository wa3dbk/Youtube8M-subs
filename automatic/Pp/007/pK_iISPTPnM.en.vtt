of the nice things here in the finishing

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.910 
of the nice things here in the finishing
of<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.719> spot<00:00:13.049> pivot<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
of the spot pivot is that you have a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.640 
of the spot pivot is that you have a
nice<00:00:14.160> matte<00:00:14.580> finish<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:15.179> blasted<00:00:15.750> finish<00:00:16.440> on

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
nice matte finish be blasted finish on

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.769 
nice matte finish be blasted finish on
both<00:00:16.859> sides<00:00:17.210> for<00:00:18.210> those<00:00:18.330> who<00:00:18.420> don't<00:00:18.600> know<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
both sides for those who don't know the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.390 
both sides for those who don't know the
spot<00:00:19.020> pivot<00:00:19.380> does<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> few<00:00:19.800> different<00:00:20.160> things

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
spot pivot does a few different things

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.420 
spot pivot does a few different things
number<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.840> your<00:00:22.230> bearing<00:00:22.890> pivot<00:00:23.160> so

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
number one that is your bearing pivot so

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
number one that is your bearing pivot so
you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> nice<00:00:23.970> smooth<00:00:24.330> action<00:00:24.539> very

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
you can have a nice smooth action very

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.810 
you can have a nice smooth action very
very<00:00:25.740> large<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.310> gonna<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.550> very<00:00:26.580> very

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
very large so it's gonna be very very

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.419 
very large so it's gonna be very very
stout<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.779> interior<00:00:28.410> diameter<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
stout the interior diameter here is the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.359 
stout the interior diameter here is the
size<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> actual<00:00:30.269> pivot<00:00:30.689> inside<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.679> it's

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
size of the actual pivot inside and it's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940 
size of the actual pivot inside and it's
gonna<00:00:32.489> act<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.239> over<00:00:33.600> travel<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.380> your

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
gonna act as your over travel for your

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
gonna act as your over travel for your
lock<00:00:35.309> bar<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> lock<00:00:36.120> bar<00:00:36.360> stabilizer

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
lock bar so it's a lock bar stabilizer

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.250 
lock bar so it's a lock bar stabilizer
as<00:00:37.260> well<00:00:37.579> very<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.670> cool<00:00:39.030> concept<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.750> what

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
as well very very cool concept but what

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
as well very very cool concept but what
makes<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:40.890> off<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> mainly

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
makes this one off is going to be mainly

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
makes this one off is going to be mainly
the<00:00:42.600> finish<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the finish and as you see it's got a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.819 
the finish and as you see it's got a
unique<00:00:44.969> anodizing<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.170> you've<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.469> blue

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
unique anodizing here so you've got blue

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
unique anodizing here so you've got blue
and<00:00:46.860> green<00:00:47.610> almost<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and green almost in like a like a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
and green almost in like a like a
paintbrush<00:00:50.100> pattern<00:00:50.579> very<00:00:50.789> wild<00:00:51.239> very<00:00:51.300> cool

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
paintbrush pattern very wild very cool

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
paintbrush pattern very wild very cool
there<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.649> two<00:00:52.860> standoffs<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there are your two standoffs this is a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.340 
there are your two standoffs this is a
standoff<00:00:54.270> model<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.840> opposed<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
standoff model as opposed to the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
standoff model as opposed to the
backspacer<00:00:55.949> model<00:00:56.250> you're<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
backspacer model you're gonna get the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.720 
backspacer model you're gonna get the
blue<00:00:57.600> anodizing<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.590> richly<00:00:59.039> done<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.520> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
custom mate pocket clip and you'll see a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.690 
custom mate pocket clip and you'll see a
dark<00:01:03.270> acid<00:01:03.930> etch<00:01:04.110> stone<00:01:04.559> wash<00:01:04.860> finish<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.460> the

dark acid etch stone wash finish on the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
dark acid etch stone wash finish on the
blade<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> blade<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> different<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
blade but the blade is different for a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.600 
blade but the blade is different for a
couple<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> reasons<00:01:08.790> number<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.540> oh<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
couple of reasons number one oh this is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.499 
couple of reasons number one oh this is
an<00:01:11.729> m3<00:01:11.939> 90<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.350> 690<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.369> you're<00:01:15.150> that

an m3 90 not and 690 if you're that
particular<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.409> Steel's<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.130> here's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
particular about your Steel's but here's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 
particular about your Steel's but here's
where<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.150> gets<00:01:18.270> different<00:01:18.630> oh<00:01:19.020> yeah

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
where it really gets different oh yeah

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this is one of the very few worn cliffs

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.789 
this is one of the very few worn cliffs
that<00:01:22.710> dave<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.040> offered<00:01:24.020> really<00:01:25.020> nice

that dave has offered really nice
looking<00:01:26.430> grind<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.290> typically<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
looking grind on this typically you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.280 
looking grind on this typically you
would<00:01:28.619> only<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.250> f3<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.240> span<00:01:30.720> toe<00:01:30.960> grind

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
would only get an f3 in a span toe grind

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920 
would only get an f3 in a span toe grind
but<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> recently<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> past<00:01:33.299> 3

but he is recently over the past 3
months<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.650> been<00:01:34.829> experimenting<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
months or so been experimenting with a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
months or so been experimenting with a
few<00:01:36.479> new<00:01:36.750> blade<00:01:37.079> profiles<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.549> has

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
few new blade profiles and this one has

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.969 
few new blade profiles and this one has
proven<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:39.750> popular<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.740> an

proven to be very very popular it is an

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
proven to be very very popular it is an
extraordinarily<00:01:41.340> sharp<00:01:42.030> knife<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.509> got<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
extraordinarily sharp knife it's got a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.389 
extraordinarily sharp knife it's got a
great<00:01:42.990> edge<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.670> there<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.509> lockup

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
great edge to it there is your lockup

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.859 
great edge to it there is your lockup
and<00:01:47.399> we'll<00:01:47.640> take<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> look<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> blade

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and we'll take a look at the blade

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.679 
and we'll take a look at the blade
centering<00:01:49.850> hard<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> see<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.299> there<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.630> a
