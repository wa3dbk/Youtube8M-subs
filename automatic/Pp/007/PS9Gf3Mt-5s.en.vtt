had some basic material that they wanted
to<00:01:00.270> include<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.750> other<00:01:00.870> than<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.129> up

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

to include but other than that it was up
to<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.989> yes<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> little

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
to me so yes it was a little

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
to me so yes it was a little
nerve-wracking<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.210> also

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
nerve-wracking at first but I also

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
nerve-wracking at first but I also
enjoyed<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> allows<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.220> more

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
enjoyed because it allows you to be more

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.240 
enjoyed because it allows you to be more
of<00:01:08.549> an<00:01:08.610> artist<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.330> leads<00:01:09.570> into

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
of an artist so this leads into

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
of an artist so this leads into
improvisation<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.000> after<00:01:12.420> shooting<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.290> little

because it kind of sells a theme of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
because it kind of sells a theme of
being<00:01:36.780> outside<00:01:36.960> kind<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> carefree

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
being outside kind of that carefree

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
being outside kind of that carefree
feeling<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.119> very<00:01:39.360> open<00:01:39.720> for

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
feeling it's very open for

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.330 
feeling it's very open for
interpretation<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
interpretation that's kind of what the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.420 
interpretation that's kind of what the
song<00:01:41.689> embodies<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.740> thought<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
song embodies and so I thought that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.749 
song embodies and so I thought that
adding<00:01:44.909> some<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.070> sunlight<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
adding some of that sunlight and some of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.330 
adding some of that sunlight and some of
the<00:01:47.820> Sun<00:01:48.090> flares<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.250> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the Sun flares in there as just kind of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700 
the Sun flares in there as just kind of
a<00:01:50.430> stylistic<00:01:50.970> element<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.659> helped<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
a stylistic element really helped the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
a stylistic element really helped the
video<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> song<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:54.030> connect

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
video and the song actually connect

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.190 
video and the song actually connect
alright

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
alright

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.770 
alright
and<00:01:55.290> finally<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> leads<00:01:56.340> me<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.780> lenses

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and finally that leads me to lenses

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600 
and finally that leads me to lenses
because<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.649> shoot<00:01:58.920> particularly

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
because for this shoot particularly

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.300 
because for this shoot particularly
having<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:00.299> lens<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> job<00:02:01.439> was

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
having the right lens for the job was

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.459 
having the right lens for the job was
quite<00:02:02.549> important<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.119> example<00:02:03.600> during<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
quite important for example during the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
quite important for example during the
performance<00:02:05.009> footage<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.579> wanted<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.119> use<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
performance footage I wanted to use a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.990 
performance footage I wanted to use a
prime<00:02:06.960> lens<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> majority<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> shots

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
prime lens for the majority of the shots

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.169 
prime lens for the majority of the shots
I<00:02:09.119> used<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.420> 59

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
I used a 59

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.220 
I used a 59
prime<00:02:10.479> lens<00:02:10.750> aka<00:02:11.909> 50/50<00:02:12.909> and<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.019> use<00:02:14.200> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
prime lens aka 50/50 and I use that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.589 
prime lens aka 50/50 and I use that
because<00:02:14.409> they<00:02:14.829> have<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.519> large<00:02:15.819> apertures

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
because they have really large apertures

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.289 
because they have really large apertures
and<00:02:16.900> that's<00:02:17.019> nice<00:02:17.290> for<00:02:17.650> two<00:02:17.799> reasons<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:19.060> one

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
and that's nice for two reasons for one

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.209 
and that's nice for two reasons for one
it<00:02:19.569> lets<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.230> lot<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.409> light<00:02:20.530> into<00:02:20.859> the<00:02:20.950> camera

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
it lets a lot of light into the camera

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.050 
it lets a lot of light into the camera
so<00:02:21.609> you<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:22.060> open<00:02:22.840> up<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.290> aperture<00:02:23.620> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so you can open up the aperture and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.240 
so you can open up the aperture and
compensate<00:02:25.060> by<00:02:25.209> reducing<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.319> ISO<00:02:26.920> and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
compensate by reducing the ISO and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.099 
compensate by reducing the ISO and
increasing<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.239> shutter<00:02:28.450> speed<00:02:28.629> what<00:02:28.930> this

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
increasing the shutter speed what this

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.379 
increasing the shutter speed what this
does<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:30.069> actually<00:02:30.159> reduces<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.239> amount

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
does is it actually reduces the amount

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.709 
does is it actually reduces the amount
of<00:02:31.510> grain<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.109> your<00:02:32.230> image<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.799> effectively

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
of grain in your image and effectively

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.690 
of grain in your image and effectively
gives<00:02:34.719> your<00:02:34.930> images<00:02:35.829> a<00:02:35.859> smoother<00:02:36.519> more

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
gives your images a smoother more

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.399 
gives your images a smoother more
professional-looking<00:02:37.329> feel<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.230> other

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
professional-looking feel the other

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.860 
professional-looking feel the other
great<00:02:38.709> thing<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.159> shooting<00:02:39.579> wide<00:02:39.939> open<00:02:40.329> is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
great thing about shooting wide open is

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.229 
great thing about shooting wide open is
that<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.829> gives<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.099> a<00:02:42.159> very<00:02:42.489> shallow<00:02:42.909> depth

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
that it gives you a very shallow depth

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.089 
that it gives you a very shallow depth
of<00:02:43.299> field<00:02:43.359> so<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.959> can<00:02:44.139> isolate<00:02:44.650> your

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
of field so you can isolate your

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.909 
of field so you can isolate your
performer<00:02:45.579> in<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:45.849> case<00:02:46.379> from<00:02:47.379> from<00:02:47.799> the

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
performer in this case from from the

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.349 
performer in this case from from the
rest<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.189> the<00:02:48.250> background<00:02:48.459> as<00:02:48.909> long<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.239> you

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
rest of the background as long as you

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.940 
rest of the background as long as you
can<00:02:49.480> keep<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.659> camera<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.200> focus<00:02:50.590> that's<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
can keep the camera in focus that's the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.360 
can keep the camera in focus that's the
only<00:02:51.159> problem<00:02:51.519> if<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.209> around<00:02:52.389> that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
only problem if you get around that

prime<00:02:54.370> lenses<00:02:54.700> are<00:02:54.939> the<00:02:55.450> bomb<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:56.409> only

prime lenses are the bomb the only
unfortunate<00:02:56.950> part<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:57.750> lenses<00:02:58.750> are

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
unfortunate part is that lenses are

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.539 
unfortunate part is that lenses are
expensive<00:02:59.409> not<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.769> prime<00:03:00.010> lenses<00:03:00.370> but

hundreds of dollars back in their day

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.089 
hundreds of dollars back in their day

or 30 bucks

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.689 
or 30 bucks
and<00:03:55.419> so<00:03:55.810> that's<00:03:56.049> allowed<00:03:56.349> me<00:03:56.379> to<00:03:56.590> get<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:57.099> whole

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
and so that's allowed me to get a whole

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.969 
and so that's allowed me to get a whole
slew<00:03:57.939> of<00:03:58.090> lenses<00:03:58.689> or<00:03:58.900> pretty<00:03:59.470> much<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.620> grand

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
slew of lenses or pretty much a grand

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.089 
slew of lenses or pretty much a grand
total<00:04:00.189> of<00:04:00.459> somewhere<00:04:01.000> around<00:04:01.739> $250<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:02.889> think

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
total of somewhere around $250 I think

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.890 
total of somewhere around $250 I think
250<00:04:03.759> $300<00:04:04.569> which<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.650> about<00:04:06.189> the<00:04:06.340> cost<00:04:06.609> of<00:04:06.819> one

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
250 $300 which is about the cost of one

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.009 
250 $300 which is about the cost of one
and<00:04:07.989> lens<00:04:08.230> or<00:04:08.560> one<00:04:08.860> modern<00:04:09.670> Sony<00:04:10.090> lens<00:04:10.360> so

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
and lens or one modern Sony lens so

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.899 
and lens or one modern Sony lens so
definitely<00:04:11.709> something<00:04:12.129> to<00:04:12.280> consider<00:04:12.430> if<00:04:12.819> you
