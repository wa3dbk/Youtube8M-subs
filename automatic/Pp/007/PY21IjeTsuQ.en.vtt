batteries in the back and then it's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
batteries in the back and then it's
supposed<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.469> last<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.890> about<00:00:46.980> 53<00:00:47.579> hours<00:00:47.700> on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
supposed to last for about 53 hours on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.400 
supposed to last for about 53 hours on
the<00:00:48.120> highest<00:00:48.270> setting<00:00:48.750> um<00:00:49.879> it's<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.480> 141

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the highest setting um it's it's got 141

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.970 
the highest setting um it's it's got 141
lumens<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.460> highest<00:00:53.670> setting<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.020> if

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
lumens at the highest setting so you if

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.410 
lumens at the highest setting so you if
you're<00:00:56.129> running<00:00:56.460> down<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> road<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> car<00:00:57.329> is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you're running down the road a car is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
you're running down the road a car is
definitely<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.859> I'll

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
definitely going to see you and I'll

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.910 
definitely going to see you and I'll
just<00:00:59.160> give<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> quick<00:01:00.390> example<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.800> how

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
just give you a quick example of how

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.310 
just give you a quick example of how
bright<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.370> light<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.019> it's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
bright this light is and and what it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.420 
bright this light is and and what it's
like<00:01:04.379> compared<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> other

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
like compared to one on the other

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.840 
like compared to one on the other
headlamps<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:10.400> alright<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
headlamps that I have alright so this is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
headlamps that I have alright so this is
an<00:01:11.970> older<00:01:12.240> headlamp<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> had<00:01:13.619> been<00:01:13.770> using

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
an older headlamp that I had been using

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.850 
an older headlamp that I had been using
for<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> while<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.299> 65<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> 70<00:01:16.470> lumens

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
for a while it's about 65 to 70 lumens

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
for a while it's about 65 to 70 lumens
and<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.820> give<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.240> example<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and I'll just give you an example of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.890 
and I'll just give you an example of
what<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> in

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
what that's like so this is with it in

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
what that's like so this is with it in
spot<00:01:22.170> mode<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> turn<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
spot mode I'm going to turn on the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
spot mode I'm going to turn on the
diffuser<00:01:24.360> which<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> use<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
diffuser which is what I use a lot of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.210 
diffuser which is what I use a lot of
times<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.159> running<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.770> kind<00:01:35.189> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
times when I'm running and that kind of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
times when I'm running and that kind of
diffuses<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> light<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.150> makes<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.570> more

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
diffuses the light it makes it go more

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
diffuses the light it makes it go more
places<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> compare<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
places so I'm going to compare that to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
places so I'm going to compare that to
the<00:01:39.329> Petzl<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.590> we'll<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the Petzl and we'll see what the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.570 
the Petzl and we'll see what the
difference<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> like

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.730 

all<00:01:48.670> right<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.000> it's<00:01:49.360> way<00:01:49.630> brighter<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.320> it

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
all right so it's way brighter and it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.500 
all right so it's way brighter and it
really<00:01:51.220> brightens<00:01:51.430> everything<00:01:51.670> up<00:01:52.060> it's<00:01:52.330> it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
really brightens everything up it's it's

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.980 
really brightens everything up it's it's
almost<00:01:52.960> it's<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.220> plenty<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.790> light<00:01:55.690> when

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
almost it's it's plenty of light when

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.540 
almost it's it's plenty of light when
you're<00:01:56.110> out<00:01:56.350> there<00:01:56.530> running<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:57.310> I'll<00:01:57.400> show

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
you're out there running then I'll show

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.180 
you're out there running then I'll show
you<00:01:57.580> what<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:57.910> like<00:01:58.000> about<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.620> run<00:01:59.950> with<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
you what it's like about to run with the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.260 
you what it's like about to run with the
spot<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:01.050> is<00:02:02.050> super<00:02:02.380> bright<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:02.920> you
