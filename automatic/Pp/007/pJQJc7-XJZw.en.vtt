 concreting is underway 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.009
 superstructure welding goes for you 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.880
 metal structures 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.080
 total total mass of metal 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.259
 bridge over the river kama 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.200
 makes 8 thousand 700 tons on

 2700 tons delivered today 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.670
 metal span near 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.210
 time must come to us two 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.259

 fit then we can continue 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.850
 collect metal at the construction site 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.920
 across the river buoy things are good 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 because professionals work here

 For example, Fedor Polenov works in the field 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
 we have been building for 21 years and because 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.680
 difficulties do not arise as recognized

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.570
 bridge construction work 350 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.940
 people around the clock so 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.630
 one can hope that the terms are marked a
