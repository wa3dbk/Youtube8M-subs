that<00:02:17.660> clip<00:02:17.930> out<00:02:18.220> could<00:02:19.220> spray<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.730> little

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
that clip out could spray it a little

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.449 
that clip out could spray it a little
bit<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.120> your<00:02:20.239> hair<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> little<00:02:20.599> soft<00:02:21.459> your

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
bit if your hair is a little soft your

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.559 
bit if your hair is a little soft your
hair<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.760> too<00:02:22.970> soft

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
hair is too soft

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.690 
hair is too soft
that's<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.230> prevents<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.770> from<00:02:24.890> holding<00:02:25.280> a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
that's what prevents it from holding a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.640 
that's what prevents it from holding a
style<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.660> your<00:02:26.930> hair<00:02:27.080> needs<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.319> be<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.470> little

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
style so your hair needs to be a little

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.150 
style so your hair needs to be a little
rough

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
rough

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.630 
rough
now<00:02:28.819> we're<00:02:28.970> gonna<00:02:29.090> smooth<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.690> out<00:02:29.750> just

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
now we're gonna smooth that out just

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.890 
now we're gonna smooth that out just
smoothing<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.790> curls<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.330> little<00:02:32.360> bit

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
smoothing out the curls a little bit

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.380
