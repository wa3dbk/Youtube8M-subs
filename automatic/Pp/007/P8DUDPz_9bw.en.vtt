quick review of the beam scanning

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.260 
quick review of the beam scanning
upgrade<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.529> jet<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.340> let's<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.699> started

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
upgrade for the jet so let's get started

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.269 
upgrade for the jet so let's get started
beam<00:00:18.779> scanning<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> vehicle<00:00:19.680> upgrade<00:00:20.130> for

experience<00:00:23.310> points<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> unlock<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.320> basically

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
experience points to unlock it basically

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.529 
experience points to unlock it basically
what<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.680> does<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.369> reduces<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.060> time<00:00:27.300> it

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
what it does is it reduces the time it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.290 
what it does is it reduces the time it
takes<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.289> lock<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.010> enemy<00:00:29.160> vehicles<00:00:29.340> with

that<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.070> using<00:00:35.550> beam<00:00:35.850> scanning<00:00:36.210> I'm

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that I'm not using beam scanning I'm

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
that I'm not using beam scanning I'm
using<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> air<00:00:37.410> radar<00:00:37.680> instead<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.940> takes

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
using the air radar instead and it takes

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.470 
using the air radar instead and it takes
quite<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> while<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.989> lock<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.890> vehicles

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
quite a while to lock on to vehicles

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.700 
quite a while to lock on to vehicles
specifically<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> takes<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:42.960> three<00:00:43.379> full

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
specifically it takes about three full

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.380 
specifically it takes about three full
seconds<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> lock<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.000> enemy<00:00:45.120> vehicle

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
seconds to lock on to an enemy vehicle

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.260 
seconds to lock on to an enemy vehicle
this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.320> long<00:00:46.620> time<00:00:46.920> especially<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.820> jet

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this is a long time especially in a jet

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.479 
this is a long time especially in a jet
since<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:48.719> moving<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.170> fast<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
since you're moving so fast and if the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.639 
since you're moving so fast and if the
enemy<00:00:50.640> pops<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.300> flares<00:00:51.629> you'll<00:00:52.260> most<00:00:52.530> likely

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
enemy pops is flares you'll most likely

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.279 
enemy pops is flares you'll most likely
have<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.250> circle<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.270> reset<00:00:54.930> behind

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
have to circle around and reset behind

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:16.370 
have to circle around and reset behind
him<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.980> walk<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> second<00:00:57.239> time

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.900 

now<00:01:17.380> here's<00:01:17.830> some<00:01:18.010> footage<00:01:18.190> width<00:01:18.640> beam

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910

the<00:01:21.790> lock<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.270> time<00:01:22.540> by<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.870> full<00:01:23.320> second<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.460> it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
the lock on time by a full second so it

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.880 
the lock on time by a full second so it
only<00:01:24.760> takes<00:01:25.120> two<00:01:25.480> seconds<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.050> lock<00:01:26.260> on<00:01:26.500> with

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
only takes two seconds to lock on with

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.700 
only takes two seconds to lock on with
beam<00:01:27.160> scanning<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:28.390> one-second<00:01:29.230> advantage

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
beam scanning that one-second advantage

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.850 
beam scanning that one-second advantage
may<00:01:29.980> not<00:01:30.280> seem<00:01:30.670> like<00:01:30.700> much<00:01:30.970> but<00:01:31.300> in<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.200> jet<00:01:32.470> that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
may not seem like much but in a jet that

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.290 
may not seem like much but in a jet that
one<00:01:33.160> second<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.820> difference<00:01:33.970> between

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
one second is the difference between

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.870 
one second is the difference between
getting<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.960> kill<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.440> having<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.400> circle<00:01:36.850> back

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
getting a kill and having to circle back

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:57.250 
getting a kill and having to circle back
around<00:01:37.330> for<00:01:37.720> another<00:01:37.810> lock-on<00:01:38.560> attack

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.590 

in<00:01:57.410> this<00:01:58.070> gameplay<00:01:58.520> footage<00:01:58.790> I'm<00:01:59.030> using<00:01:59.240> beam

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
in this gameplay footage I'm using beam

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840 
in this gameplay footage I'm using beam
scanning<00:01:59.900> with<00:02:00.170> heat<00:02:00.410> seekers<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.670> can

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
scanning with heat seekers but you can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.790 
scanning with heat seekers but you can
use<00:02:02.000> beam<00:02:02.270> scanning<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.780> reduce<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.380> lock-on

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
use beam scanning to reduce the lock-on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.130 
use beam scanning to reduce the lock-on
time<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:04.520> using<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.060> Jets<00:02:05.300> guided<00:02:05.720> missiles

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
time when using the Jets guided missiles

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.830 
time when using the Jets guided missiles
as<00:02:06.350> well<00:02:06.700> guided<00:02:07.700> missiles<00:02:08.090> allow<00:02:08.360> your<00:02:08.600> jet

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
as well guided missiles allow your jet

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.870 
as well guided missiles allow your jet
to<00:02:08.990> lock<00:02:09.170> onto<00:02:09.380> ground<00:02:09.710> vehicles<00:02:10.220> I'll<00:02:10.400> have<00:02:10.850> a

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
to lock onto ground vehicles I'll have a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:23.570 
to lock onto ground vehicles I'll have a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.980 

trust<00:02:24.580> me<00:02:24.700> once<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.090> start<00:02:25.390> using<00:02:25.630> beam

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
trust me once you start using beam

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.840 
trust me once you start using beam
scanning<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.830> won't<00:02:27.100> want<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.460> switch<00:02:27.640> back

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
scanning you won't want to switch back

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.780 
scanning you won't want to switch back
to<00:02:27.910> any<00:02:28.210> other<00:02:28.330> upgrade<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.560> makes<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.460> much

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
to any other upgrade it makes it so much

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.510 
to any other upgrade it makes it so much
easier<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.360> acquire<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.110> destroy<00:02:32.680> targets<00:02:33.190> in

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
easier to acquire and destroy targets in

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.390 
easier to acquire and destroy targets in
a<00:02:33.730> single<00:02:34.150> pass<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.110> makes<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.620> jet<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.070> lot

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
a single pass and it makes the jet a lot

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.390 
a single pass and it makes the jet a lot
more<00:02:36.760> powerful<00:02:37.180> than<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.630> already<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.260> if<00:02:39.220> you

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
more powerful than it already is if you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.740 
more powerful than it already is if you
can<00:02:39.580> stay<00:02:39.820> behind<00:02:39.880> an<00:02:40.270> enemy<00:02:40.570> aircraft

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
can stay behind an enemy aircraft

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.960 
can stay behind an enemy aircraft
without<00:02:41.440> losing<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.190> beam<00:02:42.640> scanning

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
without losing it the beam scanning
