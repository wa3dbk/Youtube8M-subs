00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.430 
it should look a little like that that's
a<00:04:57.470> beautiful<00:04:57.800> bright<00:04:58.430> little<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.660> draw<00:05:00.020> in<00:05:00.260> the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
a beautiful bright little to draw in the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.890 
a beautiful bright little to draw in the
attention<00:05:00.950> of<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.130> passing<00:05:01.240> cruising<00:05:02.240> carp<00:05:02.600> and

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
attention of a passing cruising carp and

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.650 
attention of a passing cruising carp and
because<00:05:03.770> it's<00:05:03.920> got<00:05:04.070> no<00:05:04.250> flavor<00:05:04.610> there's<00:05:05.450> only

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
because it's got no flavor there's only

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.150 
because it's got no flavor there's only
one<00:05:05.960> way<00:05:06.170> that<00:05:06.230> they're<00:05:06.590> going<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.770> be<00:05:06.920> able<00:05:07.010> to

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
one way that they're going to be able to

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.410 
one way that they're going to be able to
test<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:09.400> but<00:05:10.400> there's<00:05:10.610> one<00:05:10.820> last<00:05:11.030> thing<00:05:11.360> that

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
test it but there's one last thing that

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.110 
test it but there's one last thing that
we<00:05:11.660> have<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.960> do<00:05:12.140> by<00:05:13.040> putting<00:05:13.070> an<00:05:13.520> anti<00:05:13.820> tangle

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
we have to do by putting an anti tangle

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.350 
we have to do by putting an anti tangle
sleeve<00:05:14.600> on<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:15.620> helps<00:05:16.040> to<00:05:16.220> kick<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:17.090> hooklink

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
sleeve on it helps to kick the hooklink

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.200 
sleeve on it helps to kick the hooklink
away<00:05:18.170> from<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.710> leg<00:05:18.860> during<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:19.280> cast<00:05:19.520> and

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
away from the leg during the cast and

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.040 
away from the leg during the cast and
this<00:05:20.300> will<00:05:20.540> really<00:05:20.870> reduce<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.590> tangles<00:05:23.050> we

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
this will really reduce the tangles we

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.930 
this will really reduce the tangles we
use<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.500> with<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.680> size<00:05:24.980> eight<00:05:25.310> swivel<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:28.490> also

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
use it with a size eight swivel it also

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.940 
use it with a size eight swivel it also
means<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.300> we<00:05:29.540> can<00:05:29.780> use<00:05:29.810> one<00:05:30.530> of<00:05:30.560> our<00:05:30.740> LED

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
means that we can use one of our LED

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.830 
means that we can use one of our LED
clips<00:05:33.460> which<00:05:34.460> means<00:05:34.820> that<00:05:35.480> we<00:05:35.570> have<00:05:35.600> the

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
clips which means that we have the

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.250 
clips which means that we have the
flexibility<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:37.060> change<00:05:38.060> LED<00:05:38.420> size<00:05:38.720> to<00:05:38.990> suit

the range that we're fishing too really

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.600 
the range that we're fishing too really
it's<00:05:43.360> best<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.840> only<00:05:45.020> use<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.740> lid<00:05:45.920> necessary

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
it's best to only use the lid necessary

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.410 
it's best to only use the lid necessary
to<00:05:46.880> reach<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.390> range<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.840> fish<00:05:48.020> our<00:05:48.230> app

to reach the range the fish our app

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.060 
to reach the range the fish our app
because<00:05:50.420> otherwise<00:05:50.720> quite<00:05:51.260> often<00:05:51.500> you'll
