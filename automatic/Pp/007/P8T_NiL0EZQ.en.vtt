the<00:03:36.640> cover<00:03:37.270> camera<00:03:38.640> folder<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.880> can<00:03:40.090> see<00:03:40.300> that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the cover camera folder you can see that

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.260 
the cover camera folder you can see that
they're<00:03:40.660> squared<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.730> shape<00:03:43.000> of

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270

they're squared just like the shape of
the<00:03:44.130> cover<00:03:45.130> because<00:03:45.490> that's<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.330> viewfinder

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
the cover because that's the viewfinder

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.140 
the cover because that's the viewfinder
so<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.350> guess<00:03:47.590> they<00:03:47.770> give<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.000> that's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
so I guess they give you that so that's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.420 
so I guess they give you that so that's
it<00:03:49.330> just<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.630> really<00:03:49.990> quick<00:03:50.350> fast<00:03:50.860> look<00:03:51.190> at<00:03:51.370> the
