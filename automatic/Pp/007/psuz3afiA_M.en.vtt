00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
 our page and perso evening and takes us to the discovery of a river 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.429
 atypical in this part of the center region and is about to complete a 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.749
 true paradise for Alami fishermen 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.030
 manchester does not present course yet 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.299
 fr looking at 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.519
 hello I propose to make a refreshing discovery today 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.320
 this is the river line 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 then this river has its source in the ornament at laterriÃ¨re it goes 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.630
 to travel 160 km before throwing in the sarthe au mans 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 she will also travel 13 km here in honor and loire around nowadays 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.290
 we find 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.410
 to talk about it I'm with marcelle civil peace marcel tessier who is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.550
 president of the Nogentan fishing association an association that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.170
 is also involved in the restoration and maintenance of the river l'huisne with 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.970
 an insertion project I propose first to watch this report 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.450
 this morning, six people from the integration company are busy 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.880
 in the area of â€‹â€‹old allotment gardens nowadays find it 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.700
 a small portion of the 26 km of riverbanks has come back 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.460
 a little over a year 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.740
 it's for fishermen 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.849
 yes quite responsible for the acts he had set 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 click here enjoying the wind 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.270
 a little further in this news 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.159
 uran gerard the great inspect the work done this winter on the arm 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.210
 from the river 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 a much bigger project 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.350
 here is the whole bank that has been confirmed in retirement 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.150
 laval we see well one who would have been well 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.590
 that goes well we see it in the cinema 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 and then there anyway see them back to progress we see it that started to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 cross the carpet 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.520
 since this and concretely seed and learn to pose the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.430
 the day of the crime 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.830
 luxury still after good work 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.040
 since the other the world so far all 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.690
 all particular 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.890
 in fact it is the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.780
 the geotextile ans coco the break by this one 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.620
 all this part of the river the agreement 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.860
 erosion is also the fruit of the inhabitants of the plot who wants to see 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.850
 in the river 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.790
 it was necessary to find a solution to channel them to prevent them from too much 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.160
 of land in the watercourse 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.169
 almost five kilometers of fences have been laid 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.189
 the twenty-six power works like this one were built along 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:14.819
 line 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.069
 do we need the manager 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.929
 the climate for 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.389
 it allows year-round animals to drink 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.049
 without going directly into the river bed 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.389
 it avoids crushing the earth with fine particles that come 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.389
 clog the spawning grounds so from this point of view it's perfect 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.580
 the beneficiaries of this work are the breeders but also and especially 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580
 fisherman 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.139
 you have to load 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.109
 no activity 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.540
 no catch that day 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.949
 the prices have a lot in common are not at the rendezvous 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.199
 the water is cloudy finally rainwater fell the day before 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.899
 for this fly fisherman the work undertaken should 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.769
 significantly improve the quality of the natural environment with 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.959
 absolutely 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.299
 it's his season commitment simply 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.499
 but 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 the guards found themselves clogged 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.959
 two essential consequence - of habitat for insects activated and 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.179
 tilliet representing the pantry 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.299
 and 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.050
 the fish can not 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.339
 to breed in in gravel that has clogged 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.339
 there is a need for significant oxygenation 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:30.079
 the church interstices between the gravel but that was later the interview 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.949
 and the renovation of it come back 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.309
 should be completed by the end of September 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.870
 16 km of happiness for fishermen 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.209
 and almost 26 km of riverbanks 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.459
 for walkers 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.299
 so we've just seen it at river at it's a middle that get restored which 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.049
 talks 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.689
 this is the first time that to undergo such listings agree 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.820
 the first time she is a smoke she felt that's true 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.329
 we stay on 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.889
 in 16 km 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.889
 since one of the courses in the adornment upstream and downstream 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.589
 eyraud feast of the hand one attenuates the clogging with a Percheron fan 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:08.449
 with the help of the insertion site for the manual parties or the final but if 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.559
 even it willems the substrate and very low-cut and we can easily get you 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.339
 I said pebbles teammates that is to say that I spent with a person 

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.560
 with a harrow with the luck factor for one hour we went round in circles 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.569
 we went up yesterday but the funds from the EU 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.880
 all of a sudden we saw these stones appear in a natural way 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.819
 what fishing is practiced is six fly fishing trials or c 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.409
 is simple all the tasks one can fish fly fishing do 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.449
 like them 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.389
 a practice a lot of people around the world will take place 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.719
 nearly 300 kilometers round the fishermen come complete the lake the 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:42.689
 fly fishing 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:43.719
 on him 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.789
 but we can also fish Africa at the top 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.370
 you can fish or predator by cate blanchett 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.879
 fishing for lures 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.729
 possibly tuna fishing for those who are interested in winds 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.469
 and the guards because it's a river that is a friend you try so 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.490
 alive in the green 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.550
 a little by little, it is a living way and given 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.879
 she only has a book 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.529
 more or less closed to sex too 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.879
 so we can say that bright on the downstream part yen is quite 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.809
 live in the country 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.159
 it's a wild river it's a wild river absolutely so we're going 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.389
 reassure people it's still a river 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.360
 in which 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.870
 but we can come fishing to even dive our feet in 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.310
 absolutely everyone yells at the canoe kayak club the rest home 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.570
 and the opportunity to soak your feet had washed away this 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.480
 peculiarity of having as you can see here quite fast current and 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.520
 then after the flat boulogne areas is actually been in default 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.889
 dangerous unfortunately marcel tessier thank you very much for 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.289
 of these details of two hours is a little better to discover this 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.449
 alumina river 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.580
 so it was of course a fishermen's paradise year also 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.419
 walkers it's a very good idea to walk this summer 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.570
 you can come to just here around the margaux water body or so 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.499
 go find information at the tourist office nowadays on 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.029

 here is afp
