00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.699
 today we have to make some it is in 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.869
 drop that console in 2d very own the 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.710
 screen cinotto majestic is sprite 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.320
 orange open world greeting the tuque 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.020
 so not our development we 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.920
 we have a sound set party 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.199
 realistic 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.019
 that is to say from his island party 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.930
 of ibiza who offered us a 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.989
 realistic environment and that we and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.910
 we had to try to stay the most 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.519
 possible close to this reality while 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.510
 having performances 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.440
 match your gaming needs 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 current video 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 one of the biggest innovations for 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.630
 to the very last ones worry 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.680
 we wanted to have a cycle 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 full day / night and continuous continuous 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.950
 which involved having one of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.409
 realistic lighting to have a system 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 dynamic number while it was 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.700
 not in the first game over 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.130
 all this we added a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 real realistic management of the weather 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.190
 and one or two tea one can 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.020
 rain it can have several weather 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:48.360
 intermediate for storms one can 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:54.030
 we worked a lot on this aspect of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.369
 cross at 1 who resigned this match 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.310
 we worked hard on 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.750
 field painting radios 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.580
 it's special that they are 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.550
 may have metallic paints 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.560
 with which gives a very rendering 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.289
 particular we have invested a lot 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.390
 there on working on my work 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.650
 and this specific point to have 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.780
 a behavior of light on 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.870
 cars that are very close to the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.870
 reality 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.670
 ah yes manage to miles in the big island 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.950
 one common realistic sattelite of a 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 huguette theater 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.599
 van den heede to see himself as 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.920
 getting people going on it's weird with 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.620
 a photo this shock 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.880
 obama what is vegetation what kind of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.880
 how we can not get there 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.300
 your episode we had to also handle 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.489
 elements that we did not have in 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.319
 against and on the law and individuals 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.670
 like for example the recesses in the 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.950
 road traffic in the road network 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 that does not exist to wade so this 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.769
 asks for specific work at the level 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.930
 modeling and at the level of 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.550
 rules of conduct at the level of 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.620
 signage on the panels of 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.730
 signaling and intelligences 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.209
 Artificial whitman ex louder 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.050
 in this can bring the new york times 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.050
 or your interior
