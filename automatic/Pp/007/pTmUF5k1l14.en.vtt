00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.569 
right here so this is the product that I
don't<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.460> much<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:30.090> d<00:00:30.860> SPF<00:00:31.860> 20<00:00:32.279> smooth

because I feel like on a daily basis I

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.040 
because I feel like on a daily basis I
don't<00:00:42.640> need<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:42.970> have<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.150> much<00:00:43.540> coverage<00:00:43.930> on

little<00:01:02.710> bit<00:01:02.830> thicker<00:01:03.370> than<00:01:03.910> most<00:01:04.180> powder

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
little bit thicker than most powder

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.920 
little bit thicker than most powder
compacts<00:01:05.260> friends<00:01:06.690> here's<00:01:07.690> my<00:01:07.840> ipod<00:01:08.229> nano

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
compacts friends here's my ipod nano

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.370 
compacts friends here's my ipod nano
and<00:01:10.560> here's<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.890> powder<00:01:11.130> compact

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
and here's the powder compact

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.160 
and here's the powder compact
so<00:01:12.829> Nigel<00:01:13.219> nano<00:01:13.670> as<00:01:13.880> advertised<00:01:14.719> has<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
so Nigel nano as advertised has the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.709 
so Nigel nano as advertised has the
thickness<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.740> pencil<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.659> is

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
thickness of a pencil and so this is

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.440 
thickness of a pencil and so this is
maybe<00:01:18.259> two<00:01:18.740> or<00:01:18.770> three<00:01:18.950> pencils<00:01:19.490> thick<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:22.450> is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
maybe two or three pencils thick so is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.960 
maybe two or three pencils thick so is
what<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.720> looks<00:01:23.869> like<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.259> inside<00:01:24.970> it's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
what it looks like on the inside it's

got a little mirror and here's the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.630 
got a little mirror and here's the
powder<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:30.439> actually<00:01:30.619> opens<00:01:31.130> up<00:01:31.280> again

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
powder and it actually opens up again

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.370 
powder and it actually opens up again
it's<00:01:32.149> got<00:01:32.360> two<00:01:32.479> layers<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.960> here's<00:01:33.200> the

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
it's got two layers and here's the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.080 
it's got two layers and here's the
sluggish<00:01:33.890> fell<00:01:34.549> out<00:01:36.280> here's<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.340> sponge<00:01:37.640> that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
sluggish fell out here's the sponge that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.929 
sluggish fell out here's the sponge that
can't<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.689> comes<00:01:38.929> with<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.289> compact<00:01:39.939> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
can't that comes with the compact and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.569 
can't that comes with the compact and
here's<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.569> powder<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.619> snaps<00:01:43.100> closed

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
here's the powder and the snaps closed

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.899 
here's the powder and the snaps closed
um<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:45.110> can<00:01:45.259> probably<00:01:45.470> replace<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.520> sponge

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
um you can probably replace the sponge

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.309 
um you can probably replace the sponge
if<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.119> gets<00:01:47.270> dirty<00:01:47.450> or<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:47.869> wash<00:01:48.110> the

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
if it gets dirty or you can wash the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.289 
if it gets dirty or you can wash the
sponge<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.520> think<00:01:49.549> that<00:01:49.789> most<00:01:50.000> round

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
sponge I would think that most round

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.270 
sponge I would think that most round
sponges<00:01:50.869> or<00:01:51.020> even<00:01:51.380> square<00:01:51.770> miles<00:01:51.979> probably

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
sponges or even square miles probably

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.820 
sponges or even square miles probably
but<00:01:53.149> I<00:01:53.179> mean<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.599> is<00:01:53.659> designed<00:01:54.349> for<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.619> round

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
but I mean this is designed for a round

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.429 
but I mean this is designed for a round
sponge<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:56.299> I'm<00:01:56.569> most<00:01:56.780> rounds<00:01:57.110> fun<00:01:57.289> is<00:01:57.409> that

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
sponge so I'm most rounds fun is that

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.699 
sponge so I'm most rounds fun is that
you<00:01:57.619> get<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.799> CVS<00:01:58.250> will<00:01:58.399> probably<00:01:58.670> fit<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.209> slot

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
you get a CVS will probably fit the slot

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.730 
you get a CVS will probably fit the slot
um<00:02:01.539> as<00:02:02.539> far<00:02:02.750> as<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.959> powder<00:02:03.200> goes<00:02:03.470> I

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
um as far as the powder goes I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.260 
um as far as the powder goes I
definitely<00:02:04.099> I<00:02:04.280> let<00:02:04.459> the<00:02:04.579> coverage<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.090> gives

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
definitely I let the coverage it gives

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.990 
definitely I let the coverage it gives
me<00:02:05.479> medium<00:02:05.869> coverage<00:02:06.700> light<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.849> medium

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
me medium coverage light to medium

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.280 
me medium coverage light to medium
coverage<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.549> I<00:02:10.549> think<00:02:11.329> you're<00:02:11.569> supposed<00:02:11.780> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
coverage and I think you're supposed to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.670 
coverage and I think you're supposed to
basically<00:02:13.040> use<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.840> smooth<00:02:14.840> operator<00:02:15.319> liquid

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
basically use the smooth operator liquid

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.150 
basically use the smooth operator liquid
foundation<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:16.549> set<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.239> family

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
foundation and then set the family

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.540 
foundation and then set the family
with<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.000> press<00:02:19.240> powder<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:21.100> don't<00:02:21.280> do

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
with the press powder and I don't do

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.940 
with the press powder and I don't do
that<00:02:21.820> because<00:02:23.220> D<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.810> color<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.320> light

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
that because D this color this light

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
that because D this color this light
colored<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.730> complexion<00:02:28.120> collection<00:02:28.570> in

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
colored the complexion collection in

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.720 
colored the complexion collection in
lights<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.200> little<00:02:29.440> bit<00:02:29.710> too<00:02:29.950> yellow<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.610> my

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
lights a little bit too yellow for my

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.180 
lights a little bit too yellow for my
skin<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.530> totally<00:02:32.680> depend

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
skin so this is going to totally depend

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.020 
face looks weird like it looks way too
yellow<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.800> too<00:03:00.250> obvious<00:03:00.460> that<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:00.940> have

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
yellow and it's too obvious that I have

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.900 
yellow and it's too obvious that I have
something<00:03:01.240> on<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.980> most<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.430> time<00:03:03.670> I

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
something on so most of the time I

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.990 
something on so most of the time I
either<00:03:04.120> we're<00:03:04.600> just<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.620> liquid<00:03:05.860> foundation<00:03:06.400> or

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
either we're just a liquid foundation or

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.040 
either we're just a liquid foundation or
just<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> press<00:03:08.110> powder<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:10.150> again<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.900> will

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
just the press powder so again this will

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.630 
just the press powder so again this will
depend<00:03:11.200> entirely<00:03:11.710> on<00:03:11.890> your<00:03:12.100> skin<00:03:12.460> and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
depend entirely on your skin and

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.450 
depend entirely on your skin and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
definitely set the liquid foundation

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.880 
definitely set the liquid foundation
with<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.060> press<00:03:16.390> powder<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:16.960> your<00:03:17.260> skin<00:03:17.620> tone

matches these products very well for me
it<00:03:21.310> just<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.640> happens<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.270> doesn't<00:03:22.600> match

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
it just so happens that it doesn't match

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.560 
it just so happens that it doesn't match
that<00:03:22.840> well<00:03:23.520> but<00:03:24.520> it's<00:03:24.700> okay<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.240> mean<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.540> don't

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
most days anyways because it is too much

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.090 
most days anyways because it is too much

compact<00:03:56.180> goes<00:03:57.040> it's<00:03:58.040> pretty<00:03:58.400> good<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.670> mean

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
compact goes it's pretty good I mean

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.440 
compact goes it's pretty good I mean
it's<00:03:59.000> got<00:03:59.120> SPF<00:03:59.810> eight<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.459> can<00:04:01.730> put<00:04:02.270> on

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
it's got SPF eight so you can put on

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.330 
it's got SPF eight so you can put on
during<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.780> day<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.320> see<00:04:03.920> if<00:04:04.100> eight<00:04:04.310> is

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
during the day and see if eight is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.250 
during the day and see if eight is
probably<00:04:04.820> not<00:04:04.970> enough<00:04:05.330> for<00:04:05.750> if<00:04:05.959> you're<00:04:06.140> going
