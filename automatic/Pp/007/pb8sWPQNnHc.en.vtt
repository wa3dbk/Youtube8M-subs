00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
is probably gonna be I believe the first

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
is probably gonna be I believe the first
smartphone<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:55.199> USB<00:00:55.710> type-c<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.520> those<00:00:56.610> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
smartphone with USB type-c for those of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
smartphone with USB type-c for those of
you<00:00:56.850> who<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.449> too<00:00:57.629> sure<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:57.899> USB

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you who are not too sure about USB

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.639 
you who are not too sure about USB
type-c<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.730> basically<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.390> next<00:01:00.989> big<00:01:01.410> thing

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
type-c it's basically the next big thing

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.460 
type-c it's basically the next big thing
is<00:01:01.800> reversible<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.199> power

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is reversible you got much more power

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
is reversible you got much more power
through<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.700> faster<00:01:06.000> as

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
through there and it's much faster as

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
through there and it's much faster as
well<00:01:06.540> believe<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.350> also<00:01:07.500> charge<00:01:08.189> one

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
well believe you can also charge one

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
well believe you can also charge one
device<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:08.970> another<00:01:09.360> device<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:10.260> USB

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.960 
said that this is the new version its
version<00:01:41.820> 2.1<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.380> Snapdragon<00:01:43.860> 810<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.729> this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
version 2.1 of a Snapdragon 810 so this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.609 
version 2.1 of a Snapdragon 810 so this
shouldn't<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.509> those<00:01:45.869> heating<00:01:46.259> problem

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
shouldn't have those heating problem

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
shouldn't have those heating problem
problems<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> we've<00:01:47.430> been<00:01:47.549> seeing<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.030> other

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
problems that we've been seeing on other

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450 
problems that we've been seeing on other
devices<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.500> should<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.799> pretty<00:01:50.100> cool

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
devices so this should be pretty cool

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.859 
devices so this should be pretty cool
but<00:01:50.610> we'll<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> wait<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.780> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
but we'll have to wait and see you in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.389 
but we'll have to wait and see you in
that<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.229> third<00:01:52.409> thing<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.770> expect<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that the third thing to expect is a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
that the third thing to expect is a
fingerprint<00:01:54.060> scanner<00:01:54.119> now<00:01:54.689> we're<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.020> sure

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
fingerprint scanner now we're not sure

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.539 
fingerprint scanner now we're not sure
how<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.130> whether<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
how this is going to be whether it's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.010 
how this is going to be whether it's
going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> front<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:57.869> not

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going to be the front the back we're not

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
going to be the front the back we're not
too<00:01:58.170> sure<00:01:58.200> about<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:58.950> yet<00:01:59.159> they<00:01:59.399> have

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
too sure about that as yet they have

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
too sure about that as yet they have
confirmed<00:02:00.329> however<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.049> there<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
confirmed however that there will be a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
confirmed however that there will be a
fingerprint<00:02:02.490> scanner<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.210> they've<00:02:03.299> also

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
fingerprint scanner and they've also

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.780 
fingerprint scanner and they've also
said<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.500> better<00:02:05.100> than<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
said that this will be better than a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.300 
said that this will be better than a
touch<00:02:06.060> ID<00:02:06.350> we'll<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.649> wait<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:07.979> for

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
touch ID we'll have to wait and see for

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
touch ID we'll have to wait and see for
that<00:02:08.369> once<00:02:08.729> again<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.080> nice<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that once again but this will be nice to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.050 
that once again but this will be nice to
see<00:02:10.470> fingerprint<00:02:11.009> scanners<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.520> smartphones

now the fifth thing is the price now
what<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:47.670> expect<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.180> prices<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:48.810> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
what can we expect from the prices as a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.210 
what can we expect from the prices as a
question<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> lot<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.770> people<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:50.190> been

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
question that a lot of people have been

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.340 
question that a lot of people have been
asking<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.209> weight<00:02:51.540> thing<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.900> made<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
asking the weight thing that made the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.979 
asking the weight thing that made the
1+1<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.160> popular<00:02:53.640> was<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.450> fact<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.840> had

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
1+1 so popular was the fact that you had

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.810 
1+1 so popular was the fact that you had
all<00:02:55.110> these<00:02:55.230> high<00:02:55.440> specs<00:02:55.830> at<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.340> budget<00:02:56.640> price

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
all these high specs at a budget price

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.150 
all these high specs at a budget price
almost<00:02:57.239> half<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.690> price<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.080> other<00:02:58.620> flagships

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
almost half the price of other flagships

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
almost half the price of other flagships
out<00:02:59.370> there<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.820> that's<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.600> one<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.959> key

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
out there and that's what one of the key

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.590 
out there and that's what one of the key
things<00:03:01.440> was<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> oneplus<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.600> hopefully

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
things was of the oneplus one hopefully

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.020 
things was of the oneplus one hopefully
they<00:03:03.959> will<00:03:04.200> be<00:03:04.350> keeping<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:05.220> similar<00:03:05.880> I

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
they will be keeping this similar I

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.070 
they will be keeping this similar I
think<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.660> slightly<00:03:06.870> higher

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
think it's going to be slightly higher

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.140 
think it's going to be slightly higher
than<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> prices<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.280> had<00:03:08.489> last<00:03:08.910> year

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
than the prices that we had last year

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
than the prices that we had last year
but<00:03:10.020> one<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.530> things<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.340> sort<00:03:11.700> of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
but one of the things that is sort of

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.850 
but one of the things that is sort of
positive<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.750> pricing<00:03:13.110> side<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.500> that

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
positive on the pricing side is that

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.990 
positive on the pricing side is that
it's<00:03:13.980> still<00:03:14.070> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> be<00:03:14.340> an<00:03:14.459> invite-only

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
it's still going to be an invite-only

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000 
it's still going to be an invite-only
system<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.620> not<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:16.980> able

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
system so you are not going to be able

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.259 
system so you are not going to be able
to<00:03:17.190> go<00:03:17.310> ahead<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.610> get<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.120> was

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
to go ahead and get this this was

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.340 
to go ahead and get this this was
something<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.570> was<00:03:18.720> quite<00:03:18.870> frustrating

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
something that was quite frustrating

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.199 
something that was quite frustrating
last<00:03:19.530> year<00:03:19.739> but<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.580> doesn't<00:03:20.910> mean<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
last year but this doesn't mean that the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.820 
last year but this doesn't mean that the
price<00:03:21.450> should<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.720> quite<00:03:22.019> low<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:22.799> of

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
price should be quite low because one of

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.020 
price should be quite low because one of
the<00:03:22.950> reasons<00:03:23.220> why<00:03:23.340> they<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> invite

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the reasons why they have the invite

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.630 
the reasons why they have the invite
system<00:03:24.420> was<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.980> they<00:03:26.280> don't<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.519> to

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
system was so that they don't have to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.120 
system was so that they don't have to
bulk<00:03:27.299> mass<00:03:27.660> produce<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.260> many<00:03:28.380> devices<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
bulk mass produce so many devices and

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.920 
bulk mass produce so many devices and
then<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.580> lots<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.970> leftovers<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:30.780> then

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
then have lots of leftovers which then

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.570 
then have lots of leftovers which then
they<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.260> reduce<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> prices<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.160> they

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
they have to reduce the prices of they

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.000 
they have to reduce the prices of they
were<00:03:32.880> making<00:03:33.090> devices<00:03:33.650> according<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
were making devices according to the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.039 
were making devices according to the
demand<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.610> which<00:03:35.790> made<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.209> price<00:03:36.480> really

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
demand that which made the price really

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.170 
demand that which made the price really
really<00:03:37.410> low<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.709> hopefully<00:03:38.340> we'll<00:03:38.730> be<00:03:38.910> seeing

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
really low so hopefully we'll be seeing

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.330 
really low so hopefully we'll be seeing
a<00:03:39.330> similar<00:03:39.630> price<00:03:39.989> maybe<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.799> slightly<00:03:41.160> higher

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
a similar price maybe a slightly higher

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.370 
a similar price maybe a slightly higher
some<00:03:42.030> additional<00:03:42.480> rumors<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.930> leaks<00:03:43.049> are

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
some additional rumors and leaks are

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.930 
some additional rumors and leaks are
that<00:03:43.590> we're<00:03:43.680> going<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.830> be<00:03:43.920> getting<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.220> quad<00:03:44.549> HD

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
that we're going to be getting a quad HD

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.090 
that we're going to be getting a quad HD
display<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.750> they<00:03:46.170> should<00:03:46.440> put<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:46.890> line

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
display so they should put it in line

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.470 
display so they should put it in line
with<00:03:47.340> some<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.760> other<00:03:47.790> flagships<00:03:48.299> out

and I would have gone for these samsung

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.200 
and I would have gone for these samsung
galaxy<00:04:54.860> s6<00:04:55.100> edge<00:04:55.310> just<00:04:55.729> because<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.180> looks

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
galaxy s6 edge just because it looks

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.270 
galaxy s6 edge just because it looks
absolutely<00:04:56.600> beautiful<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.860> reason<00:04:58.039> why

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
absolutely beautiful but the reason why

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.029 
absolutely beautiful but the reason why
I<00:04:58.310> acted<00:04:58.610> with<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.940> s6<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.750> keep<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.080> s6<00:05:00.470> was

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
I acted with the s6 to keep the s6 was

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.189 
I acted with the s6 to keep the s6 was
because<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> s6<00:05:01.880> edge<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.330> UK<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.840> quite<00:05:03.169> a

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
because the s6 edge in the UK is quite a

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.330 
because the s6 edge in the UK is quite a
bit<00:05:03.380> more<00:05:03.530> expensive<00:05:03.949> and<00:05:04.010> I<00:05:04.100> couldn't

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
bit more expensive and I couldn't

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.219 
bit more expensive and I couldn't
justify<00:05:04.639> myself<00:05:05.060> spending<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.870> much<00:05:06.020> more

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
justify myself spending that much more

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.800 
justify myself spending that much more
just<00:05:07.190> for<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.400> edge<00:05:07.639> so<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:07.940> stuck<00:05:08.510> with<00:05:08.660> these

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810

reasons<00:05:29.720> around<00:05:30.289> that<00:05:30.440> but<00:05:30.590> mainly<00:05:30.830> it's<00:05:31.160> the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
reasons around that but mainly it's the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.310 
reasons around that but mainly it's the
form<00:05:31.490> factor<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.820> prefer<00:05:32.270> a<00:05:32.449> form<00:05:32.720> factor<00:05:33.110> of

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
form factor I prefer a form factor of

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.189 
form factor I prefer a form factor of
around<00:05:34.010> five<00:05:34.280> 5.1<00:05:35.120> inches<00:05:35.419> which<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.870> samsung

around five 5.1 inches which the samsung

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.060 
around five 5.1 inches which the samsung
galaxy<00:05:36.520> s6<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:38.120> think<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.199> LG<00:05:39.470> g4<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.889> a

galaxy s6 is I think the LG g4 is a

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.860 
galaxy s6 is I think the LG g4 is a
little<00:05:40.430> bit<00:05:40.550> too<00:05:40.760> big<00:05:40.970> for<00:05:41.180> my<00:05:41.210> liking<00:05:41.539> it

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
little bit too big for my liking it

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.300 
little bit too big for my liking it
might<00:05:42.080> be<00:05:42.229> fine<00:05:42.440> for<00:05:42.470> a<00:05:42.680> lot<00:05:42.800> of<00:05:42.830> people<00:05:42.949> I<00:05:43.280> know

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
might be fine for a lot of people I know

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.939 
might be fine for a lot of people I know
but<00:05:44.180> it's<00:05:44.210> still<00:05:44.449> perfectly<00:05:44.780> usable<00:05:45.409> but<00:05:45.800> for

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
but it's still perfectly usable but for

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.430 
but it's still perfectly usable but for
me<00:05:46.039> I<00:05:46.070> just<00:05:46.250> prefer<00:05:46.610> this<00:05:47.090> slightly<00:05:47.659> a<00:05:47.840> small

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
me I just prefer this slightly a small

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.140 
me I just prefer this slightly a small
form<00:05:48.740> factor<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:49.370> just<00:05:49.550> think<00:05:49.669> still<00:05:49.909> a<00:05:50.000> bit

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
form factor I just think still a bit

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.330 
form factor I just think still a bit
more<00:05:50.270> comfortable<00:05:50.659> generally<00:05:51.560> but<00:05:52.010> if<00:05:52.250> you

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
more comfortable generally but if you

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.290 
more comfortable generally but if you
want<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.520> go<00:05:52.639> out<00:05:52.669> and<00:05:52.940> get<00:05:53.060> an<00:05:53.180> android
