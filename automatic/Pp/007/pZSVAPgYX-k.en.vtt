but<00:00:40.150> that's<00:00:40.840> not<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.050> point<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.440> point<00:00:41.470> is<00:00:41.830> if

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
but that's not the point the point is if

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.530 
but that's not the point the point is if
you<00:00:42.400> want<00:00:42.520> to<00:00:42.580> pass<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.150> get<00:00:43.330> some

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
consistency of it one method will

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.090 
consistency of it one method will
probably<00:00:46.510> be<00:00:46.660> one<00:00:46.840> of<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.990> best<00:00:47.140> ways<00:00:47.410> because

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100

all the time it's so much easier for me
any<00:01:42.050> other<00:01:42.170> way<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:42.620> just<00:01:42.800> too<00:01:43.220> hard<00:01:43.870> shell

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
any other way it's just too hard shell

00:01:44.870 --> 00:02:17.500 
any other way it's just too hard shell
works

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.660 

he<00:02:18.510> misses<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:20.340> because

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
he misses here and then that's because
