00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
you today is a perfect storm which

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.940 
you today is a perfect storm which
requires<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.300> clear<00:00:09.540> 25<00:00:10.080> blocks<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
requires you to clear 25 blocks with a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.700 
requires you to clear 25 blocks with a
single<00:00:11.250> chain<00:00:11.460> block<00:00:11.990> and<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.380> find

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
single chain block and to do that I find

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.379 
single chain block and to do that I find
the<00:00:13.860> easiest<00:00:13.889> way<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> go<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> playlist<00:00:15.059> as

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the easiest way is to go to playlist as

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420 
the easiest way is to go to playlist as
you<00:00:15.509> see<00:00:15.660> em<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.260> pick<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> skin

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you see em in there and pick the skin

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.189 
you see em in there and pick the skin
that<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.300> I'm<00:00:18.570> choosing<00:00:18.750> Rockets

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
time you do that by go into collection

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
time you do that by go into collection

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and then collection box or something and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
and then collection box or something and
changing<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.320> don't<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.860> specific

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
changing it you don't for this specific

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.590

trophy<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.450> default<00:00:42.600> avatar<00:00:43.170> gives<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
trophy the default avatar gives you the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.400 
trophy the default avatar gives you the
the<00:00:45.600> guy<00:00:46.820> what<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:47.879> call<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> chain<00:00:48.300> block<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the guy what they call a chain block so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.510 
the guy what they call a chain block so
you<00:00:49.469> don't<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> change<00:00:49.980> anything<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.430> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you don't have to change anything if you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.740 
you don't have to change anything if you
have<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> default<00:00:51.120> apps<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.449> equipped

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
have that default apps are equipped

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
have that default apps are equipped
hopefully<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> blurriness<00:00:53.039> goes<00:00:53.340> away<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
hopefully this blurriness goes away you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.790 
hopefully this blurriness goes away you
know<00:00:54.210> why<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.449> being<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.719> weird<00:00:54.930> but

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
know why it's being all weird but

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.080 
know why it's being all weird but
basically<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.699> purple

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
basically I'm going to go for the purple

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
so I'm making sure I'm connecting all

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.240 
so I'm making sure I'm connecting all
the<00:00:58.649> purple<00:00:58.920> blocks<00:00:59.870> together<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.980> side

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the purple blocks together on my side

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
the purple blocks together on my side
here<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.809> 25<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.559> don't<00:01:04.710> we
