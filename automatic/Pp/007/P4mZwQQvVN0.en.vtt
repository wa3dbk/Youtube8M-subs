00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.320
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 From the series technician day I'm Ricardo and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.799
 in today's video I want to talk about 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 this little piece here that is nothing more than 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.740
 support for color amd support here 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.869
 can be happily removed from the card and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.230
 one thing I again got this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.330
 week a case of a machine and I 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.519
 I ended up reminding myself of other cases that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590
 I already got the same situation as 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.079
 this holder is plastic when the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.489
 person will install a different cooler 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.170
 from the box or even to a box that is a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 A little stiffer a little bit more 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.160
 firm than the standard 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.649
 the person ends up installing it with a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 very large pressure on this support which is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.460
 and it happens what happened 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 in the support here that is to break the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.820
 here where you pin or cure 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 cooling 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 I did not get one or two or three cases 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 I have taken several cases of clients who 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.039
 have had this type of problem in the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.989
 machines and it's actually very simple to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.790
 only that the person who 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.250
 machine has to have the minimum of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.799
 knowledge and a bit of notion as well. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 to know that it can not force the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.560
 fixing the leather to the breaking point 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 or you have to stand very firmly on top 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.729
 of support here whether or not it is of 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.479
 plastic and is not durable for life 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.790
 all 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 What happens in cases like this one 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.650
 where the bracket breaks you can try 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 with a glue bomb for example try 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.640
 glue back the loose part 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
 but I very much doubt that you have 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.180
 because it usually breaks down in the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.970
 up top, how did it happen? 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.700
 in this case here then any force that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.649
 was made after a collage 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 will end up coming back again then not 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.770
 will succeed 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.780
 we go there then the solution how to do 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.119
 when you are installing a computer with 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.579
 amd processor not to happen 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.399
 if the public who has 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.130
 too much pressure to do to prevent 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.509
 the pressure is excessive and what happens 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.930
 What happened on this support here? 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.899
 then break the fastening tips in the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.300
 Truth all you need is to let go 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.970
 a little those screws here on the tips 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.250
 at the time you turn on the cooler if 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.520
 he is doing a lot 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.670
 if he has a lot of children because if you 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.010
 force this support so you will see 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.290
 that because he is leaning against the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.040
 plate if you pull both ends to 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.480
 inside 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.090
 You will see that he does not give in to it. 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.980
 is laughing at the plate then what do you do 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.010
 you loose one turn from each of the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.990
 four screws and after releasing this 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.870
 one turn of each screw it will create 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.880
 a space between the plate and a support 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.150
 If you force it now you will see that 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.820
 there is a small fold is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.830
 ascending in the central part of it here the 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.310
 which will decrease the pressure otherwise 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.470
 will prevent catastrophic happening 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.140
 breaks this support but does not care 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.970
 if you happen to break it you get a 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.959
 machine like I already got several here 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.940
 what happened 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.980
 You can buy only this little thing here. 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.350
 I found on the open market at 14 reais 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.170
 plus the freight so you can buy the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.120
 entire bracket and replace on the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.550
 where the damage happened but to avoid 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.650
 then future damage is the tip 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.000
 loosen the screws and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.000
 You will not have a problem when 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.610
 by too much pressure that support that 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.739
 It is plastic and is not very strong 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.750
 here's my tip from today's video 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.060
 I hope you have enjoyed putting 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.700
 in a critical doubt or suggestion about the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.860
 amd brackets can leave your comment 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.140
 in the video that I'm going to try to answer 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.970
 as far as possible in the most 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.110
 thank you for your hearing and until the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.110
 our next video
