00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.359
 inspiration exists but inspiration 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.359
 since proven by train any job 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.620
 stop developing this love of the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:56.170
 ease work forward in the real 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:00.010
 meaning of dany someone who a goal 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.930
 reaches 7.1 who wants to reach some 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.970
 thing he says to himself in my life I'm going 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.320

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.480
 I want there to be 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.300
 positive changes I want them 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.740

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.750
 he has a goal towards that goal 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.970
 but against someone who is 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.550
 unable to want both ways of 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.289
 term but is only one round 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.840
 when losing because already 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.909
 difference between wanting and spears and 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.699
 that someone who wants and acts in 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:38.099
 consequence whereas hope is 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.099
 just platonic 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:46.090
 there is hope it's just platonic 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:51.030
 whereas when we want we advance in 160 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:54.759
 years we push we push we push 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.370
 last knows hang on accept this 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:00.610
 that they are fighting to move forward so 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.030
 to reach his goal his goal then 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.469
 that losing is welded but it's because 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.030
 that everyone has let go he 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.690
 we should have played that too 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.770
 lose we've changed their way of seeing their 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:17.289
 change of worldliness one must change 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.500
 our way of conceiving certain words 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.199
 or some certain details in life 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.340
 to change the way we do things 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:29.500
 things and finally have attitude 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.409
 positive even when things go wrong 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.340
 and that we board are to be enthusiastic 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.120
 joined AIDS 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.120
 but still 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.340
 to be discouraged

 keep a positive attitude 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.040
 try to get things done and 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.220
 let's not forget years went by 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.080
 hold on to fight and move 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.120
 an owl while ksm 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.460
 it's the tomé effect and it's a 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.330
