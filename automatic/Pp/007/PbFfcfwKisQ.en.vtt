on<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.580> ground<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:23.060> they've<00:00:23.480> made<00:00:23.660> a

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
on the ground and they've made a

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.900 
on the ground and they've made a
positive<00:00:24.140> start<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.039> I'm<00:00:25.310> peaking<00:00:25.520> they'll<00:00:25.789> be

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
positive start so I'm peaking they'll be

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.090 
positive start so I'm peaking they'll be
pretty<00:00:26.060> happy<00:00:26.330> with<00:00:26.480> it<00:00:26.539> a<00:00:26.810> lot<00:00:27.650> of<00:00:27.770> players<00:00:27.920> to

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
pretty happy with it a lot of players to

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.130 
pretty happy with it a lot of players to

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
pick from that's it's been the toughest

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.610 
pick from that's it's been the toughest
template<00:00:30.590> ever<00:00:31.930> and<00:00:32.930> that's<00:00:33.079> it's<00:00:33.440> not

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
template ever and that's it's not

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.250 
template ever and that's it's not
concluded<00:00:34.160> yet<00:00:34.370> obviously<00:00:35.059> pick<00:00:35.930> up<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.140> few

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
concluded yet obviously pick up a few

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.330 
concluded yet obviously pick up a few
injuries<00:00:36.500> over<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.860> last<00:00:37.040> couple<00:00:37.160> of

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
injuries over the last couple of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.900 
injuries over the last couple of
weekends<00:00:37.989> so<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.290> suspect<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.489> selection

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
weekends so I suspect the selection

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.569 
weekends so I suspect the selection
process<00:00:41.030> won't<00:00:41.510> conclude<00:00:41.780> until<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:43.190> final

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
process won't conclude until the final

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.170 
process won't conclude until the final
