00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.030
 in two minutes 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.610
 hello to my family today we are going to use 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.370
 this red polymer clay to make 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.800
 a manzanita and I'm basically 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.380
 giving it the shape of manzanita to the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 clay and then I'm going to make a hole 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.960
 in the top part so that you can 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.480
 put the small leaf of the manzanita 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.640
 I'm doing now I 'm going to use this 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.450
 green polymer clay can 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.170
 insert the little leaf in the hole 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.010
 and then I'm going to take my eye cup to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.930
 so finish the manzanita since there is the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.970
 finished apple now we put it in 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:13.360
 the oven by 275 degrees fahrenheit and the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.580
 We leave it there for 15 minutes once it is 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.620
 list now we can use it for 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.110
 make an earring and I'm going to open the ring 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:28.300
 of jewelry I will put my art here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.680
 I'm going to put the apple and 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.690
 basically this is a good gift for 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.740
 a person who is a teacher or who 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.510
