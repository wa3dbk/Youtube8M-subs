00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.740
 so to make his network 4g more 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 attractive noise that decided to launch 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 a 4g smartphone compatible 4g ​​to very 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.160
 low price 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.550
 it's the ultimate 5 that I have in my hands 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.699
 a 4.5-inch smartphone that costs 170 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.699
 euros 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 so besides its 4g compatibility 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.969
 obviously this smartphone has points 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.399
 strong starting with its rather design 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.559
 to friendly then he has a size all 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.780
 to be reasonable that will hold very 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.160
 well in the small hands it will be very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.860
 easy to use with one hand 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.930
 besides it has a case that looks 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 very strongly in terms of its forms 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.149
 at the huawei case p6 supper 7 which is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.489
 a higher end smartphone this 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 Once again, it's not at all 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.699
 same materials it is only 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
 plastic on the ultimate 5 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.480
 but let the shapes are pretty much 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 like the phone is a little bit 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 smaller it is a little bit more 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.630
 thick with a removable shell a drive 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 memory cards that we do not 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.189
 make no mistake it's well huawei who has 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 does this smartphone for breaking then the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.760
 second strong point of the ultimate 5 is 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 it's my comfort of use so he has 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
 an interface that is inspired by 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
 the huawei ps interface is also who 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.330
 is a little simplified for a smartphone 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 entry level 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 that said it is very fluid very reactive 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 very pleasant to use 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 then the smartphone is not a lightning 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.090
 of war and one under processor all to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.520
 Modest makes a qualcomm to four hearts 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.829
 cortex a7 so rather focus on 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.120
 energy saving but with a chip 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.150
 graph altogether 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.240
 honorable so what makes that all 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.990
 menus are very simple to use and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.990
 very pleasant to use 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.910
 the ultimate 5 at a photo sensor of 5 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 megapixels that is rather a good job in 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.400
 entry level 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.530
 the photos are pretty honest enough 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.330
 detailed colors are pretty much 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.370
 just then nothing extraordinary 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.100
 but it is quite acceptable while 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.280
 very honorable for a smartphone to 170 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 years 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 autonomy is not too bad 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.260
 no more then a little over eight 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 hours once the screen is on 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.630
 and 16 hours in voice communication 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.930
 it's still very modest compared to a 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.830
 middle or high end smartphone 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.600
 that said it's far from 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.860
 catastrophic either the autonomy 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.000
 is not really a weak point it's 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940
 a fair bit for a user 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.410
 intensive that said we imagine that this guy 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.100
 user will buy a phone a 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 little more expensive but the real fault that we 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.320
 found on this smartphone this is the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.590
 headphone jack which is on the side of 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.950
 the device and it's totally 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.950
 unbearable to use 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.660
 in conclusion the smartphone and the team 5 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.970
 is a smartphone that will be rather 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.370
 surprised it is compatible 4g costs 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.170
 only 70 euros from the moment 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.110
 you are a user not really 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.700
 Intensive not fan of video games that 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.080
 not spend all his day on his 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.160
 smartphone it is a purchase quite 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.250
 reconcilable and it's a very good 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.250
 case
