00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 finally on September 25, 1960 to 1 which the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 first leg of this playoff of the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.980
 world cup websites in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.330
 butcher's heel after anthony and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.190
 anthony jean jacques marcel jean jacques 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.190
 marcel fabre roasts 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.320
 in the fifth minute exactly 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.820
 finally by well kept 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.110
 and then anthony enjoying the east because 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.370
 you saw it from a Finnish player 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.520
 pass the ball between his legs 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.970
 discarded and launched a year before jacky 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.970
 FÃ¨vre 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.540
 pichot and lies 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:51.040
 and bim is that all this is very 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:54.280
 very pretty and it's a second goal for 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.629
 France while we play 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.260
 9 because 40 minutes that we play 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.269
 in five minutes 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.269
 the end of the first half time is going to be 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.489
 whistled and I thought that the 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.990
 French to score a goal of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.790
 plus what would have besides 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.840
 made their domination sufficiently 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.729
 during this first half time 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.759
 here is weak who will perhaps give me 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.759
 reason 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.400
 and the French player who was able to commit 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.830
 a fault against their mill 2 and the 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.180
 hardly I apologize I was a little 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.010
 distracted for a split second 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.460
 anyway a free kick in the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.460
 surface to repair 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.760
 how 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.869
 this is the goal is marked by a yes 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.840
 7-3 face the Finnish wall is not a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.840
 as m 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.000
 finally it's a duel 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.710
 Bravo soon or 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.610

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.209
