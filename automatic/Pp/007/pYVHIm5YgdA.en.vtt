the<00:01:01.770> direction<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> shoot<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.870> who

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the direction of the way I shoot and who

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
the direction of the way I shoot and who

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.880 
that's a good thing to to give back I
think<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> worthwhile<00:01:10.170> endeavor<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
think it so it's a worthwhile endeavor I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.200 
think it so it's a worthwhile endeavor I
think<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> more<00:01:14.250> specifically<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.030> about

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
think and more specifically just about

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.550 
think and more specifically just about
your<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.689> approach<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> share<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.470> you're

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
your your approach to share and you're

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
your your approach to share and you're
very<00:01:16.710> open<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.850> build<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.299> scenes<00:01:18.570> from

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
very open you build your scenes from

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.480 
very open you build your scenes from
nothing<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.770> you're<00:01:19.950> willing<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> make

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
nothing and you're willing to make

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
nothing and you're willing to make
mistakes<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.049> great<00:01:22.080> approach

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
mistakes I think that's a great approach

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
mistakes I think that's a great approach
but<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.970> speak<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.540> bit<00:01:24.630> more

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
but can you speak just a little bit more

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.429 
but can you speak just a little bit more
about<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.020> sure<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.869> much<00:01:28.110> believe

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
about that sure I do very much believe

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.069 
about that sure I do very much believe
there<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:28.950> secrets<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.610> business

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
there are no secrets in this business

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.560 
there are no secrets in this business
people<00:01:31.079> hold<00:01:31.380> secrets<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.180> they

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
people hold secrets you know that they

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.760 
people hold secrets you know that they
don't<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:33.869> teachers<00:01:34.320> let's<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
don't make good teachers let's put it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.270 
don't make good teachers let's put it
that<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:36.090> fine<00:01:36.829> my<00:01:37.829> approach<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that way and that's fine my approach to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.499 
that way and that's fine my approach to
doing<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.049> open<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.950> share<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
doing this is to be open to share what I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
doing this is to be open to share what I
do<00:01:42.659> who<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> am<00:01:43.579> behind<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.880> camera<00:01:45.500> again<00:01:46.500> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
do who I am behind the camera again this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.389 
do who I am behind the camera again this
very<00:01:47.189> human<00:01:47.369> element<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.060> teaching<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.399> also

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
very human element of teaching is also

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
very human element of teaching is also
correlates<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> having<00:01:51.840> human<00:01:52.140> being<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
correlates to having human being in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.660 
correlates to having human being in
front<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> your<00:01:52.890> camera<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.310> doing<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
front of your camera and doing a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940

an array of Simon's over the years that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.689 
an array of Simon's over the years that
I<00:04:19.560> probably<00:04:19.919> would<00:04:20.160> have<00:04:20.220> gone<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.639> done

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
I probably would have gone and done

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.600 
I probably would have gone and done
anyway<00:04:21.329> if<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:22.289> have<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> dominant<00:04:23.039> thread<00:04:23.370> to

the work that is more personal for me I

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.040 
the work that is more personal for me I
guess<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.639> would<00:04:26.760> have<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.090> involved<00:04:27.570> with
