perfect sense obviously uh okay uh I I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.150 
perfect sense obviously uh okay uh I I
can't<00:03:58.110> think<00:03:58.290> too<00:03:58.320> much<00:03:58.560> what<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.860> say<00:03:59.040> about

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.280 
can't think too much what to say about
this<00:03:59.340> episode<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.209> guess<00:04:00.480> sort<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.050> mother

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
this episode I guess sort of the mother

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.530 
this episode I guess sort of the mother
not<00:04:01.530> recognizing<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.640> child<00:04:03.060> because<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.390> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
not recognizing the child because of the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.600 
not recognizing the child because of the
scent<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.900> guess<00:04:04.050> that<00:04:04.200> sort<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.610> interesting

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
scent I guess that sort of interesting

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.949 
scent I guess that sort of interesting
information<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.209> give<00:04:06.330> about<00:04:06.540> how<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> lot<00:04:06.900> of

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
well I remember when I was like younger

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.200 
well I remember when I was like younger
and<00:04:22.680> everything<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:23.550> everyone<00:04:23.820> smile

you come across like a bird that had

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.580 
you come across like a bird that had
fallen<00:04:25.950> out<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.400> nest<00:04:26.640> or<00:04:26.880> something<00:04:26.910> like

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
fallen out of a nest or something like

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.430 
fallen out of a nest or something like
and<00:04:27.919> as<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.880> kid<00:04:29.480> you<00:04:29.510> want<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.870> help<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.260> take

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
and as a kid you want to help and take

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.080 
and as a kid you want to help and take
care<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:30.889> animal<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.400> everything<00:04:31.880> not

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
care of this animal and everything not

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.400 
care of this animal and everything not
realizing<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.900> what<00:04:33.050> you're<00:04:33.230> actually

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
realizing that what you're actually

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.100 
realizing that what you're actually
doing<00:04:33.590> is<00:04:34.130> probably<00:04:34.940> harming<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> animal

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
doing is probably harming the animal

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.140 
doing is probably harming the animal
more<00:04:36.260> than<00:04:36.440> helping<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.820> think<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.090> is

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
more than helping it and I think this is

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.530 
more than helping it and I think this is
a<00:04:38.300> great<00:04:38.570> example<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:39.380> actually<00:04:39.889> just<00:04:40.130> that

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
a great example of actually just that

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.730 
a great example of actually just that
we're<00:04:41.540> oh<00:04:41.840> we're<00:04:42.199> just<00:04:42.260> going<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.500> take<00:04:42.590> this

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
we're oh we're just going to take this

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.020 
we're oh we're just going to take this
little<00:04:42.949> creature<00:04:43.160> that's<00:04:43.430> following<00:04:43.760> us<00:04:43.880> and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
little creature that's following us and

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.760 
little creature that's following us and
take<00:04:44.150> it<00:04:44.270> home<00:04:44.300> as<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.540> pet<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.080> then<00:04:45.680> they

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
take it home as a pet and then they

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.560 
take it home as a pet and then they
start<00:04:46.070> kind<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.400> messing<00:04:46.820> things<00:04:47.030> up<00:04:47.300> and

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
start kind of messing things up and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.210 
start kind of messing things up and
everything<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:48.229> do<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.530> try<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.740> help<00:04:48.979> it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
everything they do to try to help it

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.370 
everything they do to try to help it
isn't<00:04:50.120> helping<00:04:50.419> it's<00:04:50.570> making<00:04:51.139> everything

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
isn't helping it's making everything

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.290 
isn't helping it's making everything
worse<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:52.250> only<00:04:52.430> way<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.610> make<00:04:52.790> this<00:04:52.910> animal

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
worse the only way to make this animal

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.150 
worse the only way to make this animal
better<00:04:53.449> is<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.720> give<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.139> back<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.530> its<00:04:54.560> parents

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
better is to give it back to its parents

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.180 
no wait / i feel like you know i'm
probably<00:05:23.210> quiet<00:05:23.810> or<00:05:24.260> something<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:24.919> no

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
probably quiet or something so no

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.379 
probably quiet or something so no
actually<00:05:25.520> it's<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.669> very<00:05:25.880> legitimate<00:05:26.060> point<00:05:26.630> um

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
actually it's a very legitimate point um

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.120 
actually it's a very legitimate point um
never<00:05:29.389> put<00:05:29.810> that<00:05:29.870> together<00:05:30.080> know<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.620> that's<00:05:31.010> a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
never put that together know it that's a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.219 
never put that together know it that's a
very<00:05:31.340> very<00:05:31.520> good<00:05:31.700> point<00:05:31.970> um<00:05:33.250> yeah<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:35.210> i<00:05:35.990> guess

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
very very good point um yeah so i guess

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.930 
very very good point um yeah so i guess
it<00:05:36.380> is<00:05:36.470> sort<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.740> teaching<00:05:36.919> in<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.580> sense

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
it is sort of teaching in a sense

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.659 
it is sort of teaching in a sense
whether<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:39.080> knows<00:05:39.350> it<00:05:39.590> or<00:05:39.710> not<00:05:39.740> i<00:05:39.889> mean<00:05:40.190> it<00:05:40.550> is

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
whether it knows it or not i mean it is

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.040 
whether it knows it or not i mean it is
our<00:05:40.820> teaching<00:05:41.150> kids<00:05:41.300> about<00:05:41.450> like<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:42.020> know

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.820 
like okay he's not dead everything's
fine<00:06:55.400> I<00:06:55.820> always<00:06:56.420> heard<00:06:56.660> that's<00:06:56.930> how<00:06:57.080> like<00:06:57.440> I

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
fine I always heard that's how like I

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.920 
fine I always heard that's how like I
was<00:06:58.790> just<00:06:58.910> watching<00:06:59.060> evil<00:06:59.330> than<00:06:59.480> two<00:06:59.630> again

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
was just watching evil than two again

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.210 
was just watching evil than two again
and<00:07:00.110> I<00:07:00.170> guess<00:07:00.380> that's<00:07:00.590> how<00:07:00.680> they<00:07:00.830> got<00:07:00.980> past

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
and I guess that's how they got past

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.620 
and I guess that's how they got past
like<00:07:01.460> some<00:07:01.640> of<00:07:01.700> the<00:07:01.760> rating<00:07:02.120> problems<00:07:02.480> is<00:07:02.600> that

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
like some of the rating problems is that

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.390 
like some of the rating problems is that
they<00:07:02.870> change<00:07:03.200> the<00:07:03.440> color<00:07:03.680> of<00:07:03.770> the<00:07:03.920> blood<00:07:04.070> like

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
they change the color of the blood like

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.070 
they change the color of the blood like
they'll<00:07:04.550> have<00:07:04.670> green<00:07:05.000> blood<00:07:05.330> and<00:07:05.600> blue<00:07:05.780> blood

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
they'll have green blood and blue blood

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.840 
they'll have green blood and blue blood
and<00:07:06.290> stuff<00:07:06.500> and<00:07:06.710> I<00:07:06.860> guess<00:07:07.310> sometimes<00:07:07.520> if<00:07:07.790> you

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
and stuff and I guess sometimes if you

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.430 
and stuff and I guess sometimes if you
just<00:07:07.880> changed<00:07:08.390> the<00:07:08.510> color<00:07:08.720> to<00:07:08.930> something<00:07:09.110> else
