beginning and at the end of the cover
that's<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.769> make<00:03:32.920> sure<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.310> film

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
that's just to make sure that a film

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.190 
that's just to make sure that a film
stays<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.090> place<00:03:34.330> trust<00:03:34.630> me<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:34.900> not<00:03:35.050> gonna

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
stays in place trust me it's not gonna

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.380 
stays in place trust me it's not gonna
move<00:03:35.410> anyway

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.199 

so<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.569> is<00:03:40.690> how<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> looks<00:03:41.170> right<00:03:41.260> now<00:03:41.440> and

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
so this is how it looks right now and

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.940 
so this is how it looks right now and
remember<00:03:43.209> how<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.569> told<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.050> cut<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.500> film<00:03:44.800> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
remember how I told you I cut the film a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.500 
remember how I told you I cut the film a
little<00:03:45.099> smaller<00:03:45.610> coming<00:03:46.030> down<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.480> end

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
little smaller coming down to the end

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.900 
little smaller coming down to the end
while<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.349> was<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> accommodate<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:48.220> tiny<00:03:48.489> space

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
while it was to accommodate a tiny space

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.300 
while it was to accommodate a tiny space
like<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.450> which<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.110> just<00:03:50.349> think<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.680> perfect

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
like this which I just think is perfect

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.460 
like this which I just think is perfect
if<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.520> have<00:03:51.819> loose<00:03:52.209> pairs<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.930> earrings<00:03:53.319> that

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
if you have loose pairs of earrings that

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.440 
if you have loose pairs of earrings that
you've<00:03:53.620> lost<00:03:53.920> or<00:03:54.190> studs<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.970> Stoppers

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
you've lost or studs and Stoppers

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.300 
you've lost or studs and Stoppers
because<00:03:56.110> I'm<00:03:56.230> very<00:03:56.410> prone<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.800> doing<00:03:57.160> things

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
because I'm very prone to doing things

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.250 
because I'm very prone to doing things
like<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:58.030> now<00:03:58.239> it's<00:03:58.420> time<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.720> organize

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260

have this definitely look for a tin or
something<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.460> could<00:05:03.699> work<00:05:03.909> and<00:05:04.090> if<00:05:04.360> it's

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
something that could work and if it's

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:05.999 
something that could work and if it's
not<00:05:04.659> clear<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.229> you<00:05:05.319> want<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.620> cover<00:05:05.800> it

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
not clear and you want to cover it

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.740 
not clear and you want to cover it

container<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.449> clear<00:05:10.780> like<00:05:10.990> this<00:05:11.199> so<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.800> peel

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
container is clear like this so the peel

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.770 
container is clear like this so the peel

Ickes<00:05:14.199> I'm<00:05:14.409> just<00:05:14.590> taking<00:05:14.889> some<00:05:14.979> vinegar<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:15.669> a

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
Ickes I'm just taking some vinegar on a

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.270 
Ickes I'm just taking some vinegar on a
round<00:05:16.000> cotton<00:05:16.539> and<00:05:16.780> buffing<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.740> into<00:05:18.159> the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
round cotton and buffing it into the

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.159 
round cotton and buffing it into the
surface<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.849> make<00:05:19.030> sure<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.389> is<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.720> keeper

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
surface to make sure that is a keeper

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.320 
surface to make sure that is a keeper
here<00:05:20.380> so<00:05:21.039> it<00:05:21.159> looks<00:05:21.370> like<00:05:21.460> this<00:05:21.699> now<00:05:21.909> I'm<00:05:22.150> just
