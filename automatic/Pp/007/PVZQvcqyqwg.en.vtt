working hard outside of practice and I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.740 
working hard outside of practice and I

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
think that's shown in our stats I could

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.309 
think that's shown in our stats I could
definitely<00:02:43.900> tell<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:46.060> work<00:02:46.239> ethic<00:02:46.690> for

definitely tell that the work ethic for
this<00:02:47.530> team<00:02:47.860> was<00:02:48.220> definitely<00:02:49.060> much<00:02:49.299> higher

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
this team was definitely much higher

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
this team was definitely much higher
than<00:02:49.629> anything<00:02:49.840> I'd<00:02:50.079> seen<00:02:50.349> before<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.950> don't

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
than anything I'd seen before I don't

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.890 
than anything I'd seen before I don't
think<00:02:51.370> experience<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.060> really<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.299> big<00:02:52.480> factor

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900
