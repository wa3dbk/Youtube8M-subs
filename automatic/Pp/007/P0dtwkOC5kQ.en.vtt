take<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.000> little<00:03:22.150> bit<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.930> yes<00:03:23.350> this

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
take a little bit of that and yes this

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.780 
take a little bit of that and yes this
is<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.800> light<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:25.480> had<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:26.110> light

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
is the light they had a light

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.490 
is the light they had a light
light/medium<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:28.900> they<00:03:28.990> had<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.110> fair

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
light/medium and then they had a fair

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.590 
light/medium and then they had a fair
but<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:29.800> fair<00:03:30.010> seemed<00:03:30.310> too<00:03:30.730> bright<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.390> I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
but the fair seemed too bright so I

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.450 
but the fair seemed too bright so I
figured<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.320> would<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.470> stick<00:03:32.890> with<00:03:33.850> this

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
figured I would just stick with this

figured I would just stick with this
okay<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:36.670> then

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
and I kind of pack it on there and just

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:55.270 
and I kind of pack it on there and just
let<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.519> sit<00:03:43.790> for<00:03:43.819> a<00:03:43.969> second

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.960 

okay<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.440> super<00:03:58.130> creamy<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:58.670> we're<00:03:58.820> going<00:03:58.910> to

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:48.719 

kind<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.880> separate<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.360> out<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> bit

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.140 

it<00:04:49.360> does<00:04:49.539> its<00:04:49.719> job<00:04:49.749> it<00:04:50.469> does<00:04:50.680> exactly<00:04:51.129> what<00:04:51.610> it

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
it does its job it does exactly what it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.519

the<00:04:56.650> difference<00:04:57.009> between<00:04:57.389> just<00:04:58.389> applying<00:04:58.659> it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
the difference between just applying it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.739 
the difference between just applying it
on<00:04:58.960> this<00:04:59.110> side<00:04:59.379> and<00:05:00.029> the<00:05:01.029> fact<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.389> it's<00:05:01.569> been

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:01.749 
on this side and the fact that it's been

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.409 
on this side and the fact that it's been
on<00:05:01.779> this<00:05:02.020> side<00:05:02.229> all<00:05:02.529> day<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:03.009> put<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:03.789> on<00:05:03.999> at
