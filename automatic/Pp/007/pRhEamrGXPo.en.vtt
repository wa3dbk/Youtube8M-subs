00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.300
 there were values and a fragment 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.300
 fletcher forbes 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.199
 fighting games and superheroes a 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.119
 combination that tends to work well 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.649
 if we also add the talent of 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.269
 responsible study of the last mortal 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.340
 kombat very bad things have to be done 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.530
 so that the formula does not work in 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.719
 justice gotcha monas is a game that 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.800
 it will be very familiar to all those 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.390
 who enjoyed dismembering 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.370
 limbs with raid in sub 0 and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.079
 company completely maintains the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.449
 essence of his predecessor his system of 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.860
 control and even a few hits similar to 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.629
 At first sight, the only difference is that 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.579
 all the characters come from the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.830
 dc comics factory but when 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.680
 we inquired a little more we discovered some 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.210
 What a further nuance 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.920
 we will not deny that it results 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.600
 tremendously funny distributing bast 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.120
 with characters the likes of superman 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.320
 batman green lantern or catwoman and 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.090
 although we can also control 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.340
 other characters more tacky as 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.200
 wonder woman or aquaman many of the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.390
 The game's fighters are authentic 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.220
 icons for whole generations the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.020
 control of each of them is very 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.400
 accessible to anyone could be 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.530
 say that in justice it follows the devil 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.150
 that of easy to control difficult to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 dominate because just like what happened with 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.780
 deadly kombat run every move 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.040
 it's a piece of cake but chain combos 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.810
 perform defensive actions 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.610
 timely and have good timing with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.399
 our special hits is not so 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.110
 easy yet it's a game that knows 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.460
 reward our good know-how and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.410
 once we get their controls 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 It is very satisfying to launch 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.530
 our opponent through the air and 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.080
 chain a good assortment of blows 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.580
 demolishing but quiet not everything is 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.710
 exactly as in mortal kombat 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.390
 one of the most striking novelties is 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.800
 the use that is given to the stage because 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.360
 we can interact with the different 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.520
 elements to launch containers 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.410
 pick up giant posters to hit 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.940
 to our rival or even break the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.920
 wall of a giant fish tank to create 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.960
 an impromptu flood that drags 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 our rival on the stage the most 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.780
 curious is that every 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.369
 of character can interact with each 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.410
 one of these objects differently 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.900
 giving rise to more varied situations 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.640
 of what may seem at first sight 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 another interesting novelty are 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.640
 special movements in which 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.650
 our two characters are hit 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.700
 simultaneously and where we can bet 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.980
 a stretch of our energy bar 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.870
 to decide who wins the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.640
 shock at first seemed like a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.560
 sovereign stupidity but the truth is that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.480
 causes a continuous dilemma to decide 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.880
 when to use and when to reserve 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.080
 beautiful lessons from our bar 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.210
 but if there is something that stands out above 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.950
 of the rest in justice is the 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.870
 spectacularity of some sequences very 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.430
 movies that remind us that 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.620
 after all, we are struggling with 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.900
 superheroes are not all kicks and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.950
 punches typical of street fights 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.110
 some of the super hits are a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.610
 authentic brutality there is nothing more to see 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.170
 to superman throwing his opponent to the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.940
 stratosphere fly out and go back to 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.890
 stamp it against the ground or sweet and 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.840
 making his rival cross the planet 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.420
 literally side by side with 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.130
 punching 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.900
 another type of sequences 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.610
 spectacular are given when we change 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.200
 of zone and half of a combat when throwing 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.510
 to the opponent beyond the limits of 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.310
 level because sometimes we even finish 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.440
 hurting in first person the amount 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.550
 and brutality of the impacts when bouncing 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.280
 against the different elements of the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.690
 scenario the problem is that despite 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.160
 the impact of some scenes and others 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.989
 once we have enjoyed them for 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.640
 first time, little else remains to be seen 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.780
 because in the long run they end up doing 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.510
 repetitive and loses interest 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.040
 irremediably we can not ignore either 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
 the ups and downs that we are between 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.220
 the movements of some characters and 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.630
 others especially if we entered the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.920
 comparative gods with the great mortal 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.980
 kombat because as much as what 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.510
 let's try there is no color see harley 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.489
 quinn placing a pump pie between 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.230
 the stones of your rival can result 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.270
 fun but it does not stop being a little 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.280
 bland 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.290
 in justice has several ways of 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.700
 interesting game a story mode that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.560
 following the wake left by mortal 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700
 kombat is much more attractive than 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.040
 the vast majority of games 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.690
 fight the plot begins with the joker that 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.820
 get to make the day superman so that 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.680
 killed by mistake his wife and son who 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.090
 he was carrying on his belly in case it was not 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.740
 enough argument to piss off the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.480
 steel man also pops 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.640
 a nuclear bomb in metropolis killing 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.560
 a good part of its population after this 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.610
 dramatic starting point the plot we 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.110
 leads to visit different moments 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.370
 temporals of history and universes 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.370
 parallels where events 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.470
 they take different paths a story 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.150
 interesting that also allows us to go 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.520
 trying different characters as 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.750
 that we are going from chapter the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.180
 problem is that it is scandalously 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.730
 short and in just four hours you can 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.260
 complete without problems luckily 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.210
 We have other ways, such as 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.650
 missions stars a way similar to the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.020
 tower of mortal kombat challenges 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.910
 where we will have to overcome 240 tests 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.190
 different some of them are 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.600
 really entertaining other groupers 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.880
 procedures that end up giving the sensation 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.200
 that it's about fill levels 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 finally we have the possibility 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.560
 to wage sequential battles against 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.750
 several enemies and under different 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.730
 conditions and how not 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.170
 multiplayer that surely we 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.260
 will bring the most amount of hours to 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.940
 long term technically the game the 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.290
 truth is that it looks great 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.180
 design of scenarios such as 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.400
 characters and their animations are a 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.230
 authentic luxury does not get rid of some 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.420
 small graphic errors but as a rule 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.160
 The sound is forgivable for its 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.750
 part is also at the height and both 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.120
 the effects as the voices are of a 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.930
 exceptional quality the penalty is that no 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.930
 we get doubled to Castilian 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.250
 in justice gotcha monas is a good game 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.230
 of struggle and a full- fledged tribute to 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.480
 the characters of dc comics that no 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.890
 fan should lose is inherited almost all 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.660
 the virtues of the combat system of 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.520
 last mortal kombat and that's always 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.080
 a guarantee of success but does not get 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.240
 its exceptional level of quality in the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.950
 rest of the sections or the sequences 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.810
 they are so spectacular even though 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.010
 some are past my two modes of 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.260
 so worked games 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.400
 even so in justice is a game that 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.080
 deserves to be among the greats of 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.760
 gender because we can not deny that 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.660
 control all these superheroes is 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.730
 an authentic delight good except to 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.730
 wonderwoman that is so tacky the poor 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.950
 good 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
 i
