00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
off and try and find something to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.820 
off and try and find something to
support<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> point<00:03:12.180> you've<00:03:12.420> made<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:13.050> just

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
support the point you've made I just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.040 
support the point you've made I just
think<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.940> much<00:03:15.120> quicker<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.570> might<00:03:15.750> take

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
think it's so much quicker it might take

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.500 
think it's so much quicker it might take
maybe<00:03:16.400> two<00:03:17.400> or<00:03:17.550> three<00:03:17.580> hours<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> write<00:03:18.360> an

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
maybe two or three hours to write an

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.330 
maybe two or three hours to write an
essay<00:03:18.630> plan<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.739> find<00:03:20.010> all<00:03:20.310> your

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
information maybe more depending on the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.870 
information maybe more depending on the
type<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.410> essay<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.220> once<00:03:23.430> you've<00:03:23.640> done<00:03:23.670> that
