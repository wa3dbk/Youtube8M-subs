about frame data are and I know not the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.339 
about frame data are and I know not the
basic<00:00:26.550> stuff<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:27.810> things<00:00:28.199> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
basic stuff but just some things that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.179 
basic stuff but just some things that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
might cause confusion when you starting

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.930 
might cause confusion when you starting
out<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.899> understand<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:33.989> frame<00:00:34.290> data<00:00:34.530> works

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
out to understand how frame data works

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.680 
out to understand how frame data works
so<00:00:35.940> first<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.230> let's<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:38.480> frame<00:00:39.480> data

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so first of all let's see frame data

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.560 
so first of all let's see frame data
when<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> frame<00:00:41.670> data<00:00:41.879> sites<00:00:42.210> like

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
when you get to frame data sites like

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.500 
when you get to frame data sites like
srk<00:00:43.260> wiki<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.129> been<00:00:44.280> ups<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.149> notice

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
srk wiki and have been ups you notice

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
srk wiki and have been ups you notice

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
columns and you have columns will start

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.420 
columns and you have columns will start
up<00:00:49.500> active<00:00:49.890> recovery<00:00:50.160> hit<00:00:50.879> block<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:52.430> other

means<00:00:58.399> how<00:00:59.399> long<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.059> takes<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> move<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
means how long it takes for the move to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
means how long it takes for the move to
hit<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.359> opponent<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:05.510> active<00:01:07.130> means<00:01:09.229> how

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
hit the opponent and active means how

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.450 
hit the opponent and active means how
long<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> move<00:01:12.650> remains<00:01:13.650> possible<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.280> hit

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
long is the move remains possible to hit

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
long is the move remains possible to hit
I<00:01:14.640> mean<00:01:14.970> by<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.600> mean<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:15.990> long<00:01:16.229> does<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I mean by that I mean how long does it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.980 
I mean by that I mean how long does it
stay<00:01:16.729> hittable<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.890> would<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:21.110> how<00:01:22.400> long

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
stay hittable so that would be how long

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.730 
stay hittable so that would be how long
it<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.619> hit<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.900> okay<00:01:28.369> then<00:01:30.409> finally<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.560> have

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it can hit you okay then finally we have

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.679 
it can hit you okay then finally we have
the<00:01:32.270> recovery<00:01:33.979> which<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.310> usually<00:01:36.000> how<00:01:36.270> long

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the recovery which is usually how long

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.800 
the recovery which is usually how long
it<00:01:36.900> takes<00:01:37.250> for<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:41.810> complete

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it takes for you to you know complete

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
how this one particular it works it's in

my playlist you find it there and then

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.380 
my playlist you find it there and then
the<00:02:24.690> next<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.819> what<00:02:26.819> next<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.269> have

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the next we have on what next we have

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.930 
the next we have on what next we have
okay<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.930> high<00:02:28.530> low<00:02:28.830> block<00:02:29.250> okay<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
okay you have high low block okay the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.140 
okay you have high low block okay the
block<00:02:30.330> column<00:02:31.230> which<00:02:31.620> checks<00:02:32.549> would<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.760> move

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
block column which checks would I move

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.009 
block column which checks would I move
its<00:02:33.599> high<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.200> slow<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:35.540> basically<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.810> block

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
its high it slow or basically can block

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.059 
its high it slow or basically can block
any<00:02:37.049> how<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.410> choose<00:02:37.680> that's<00:02:38.670> high<00:02:38.880> low<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:40.069> i

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
any how you choose that's high low and i

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.080 
any how you choose that's high low and i
think<00:02:41.549> i<00:02:42.049> have<00:02:43.340> probably<00:02:44.340> covered<00:02:44.849> everything

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
think i have probably covered everything

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.000 
think i have probably covered everything
and<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:48.450> i<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.720> want<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.140> talk<00:02:49.290> about<00:02:49.319> some
