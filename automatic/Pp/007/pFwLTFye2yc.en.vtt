00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.199
 I was still single we were 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.019
 dating she was dating 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.839
 And then what was my 30th birthday? 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:54.670
 I wanted to have a better party during the 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:57.940
 party we took the pictures and the and then 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.159
 party is to download these photos from 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.589
 Memory card from the machine to a pen 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.720
 drive for convenience and I 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.570
 I lost the stick had imagined 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.080
 lost the city center when 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.690
 He gave live 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.840
 he got there and the fact of his message has 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.640
 of all the photos were there and I no longer 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 I had more hope of finding the pen 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:29.049
 drive has spent a lot of time until 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.799
 that my father called me on ice in 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:38.319
 January of this year and asked for a help here 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:41.110
 in his house because there was the 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.049
 passed a thunderstorm on the eve 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.899
 When it does it damages 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:53.109
 are trees is even a flag or 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:55.119
 knife thing is the wind twisted 23 him like 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.049
 I could do alone he called me and I 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.049
 I have to help him. 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.490
 and I looked at the ground, I 'm just not going to 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.490
 stumble even incurring as soon as I 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.860
 I looked at the ground, I hit the eye, there's no drive. 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.820
 that I had not imagined that I had lost 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.040
 he here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.920
 I took it off the ground and showed my father the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.630
 that the stone I lost and there it was 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.970
 hoping to recover the photos 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.250
 because the card was saved there 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.850
 memory had been erased after the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.600
 with so much time on the land where it is 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.590
 which was dirty I thought not 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.590
 it worked 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.340
 I thought it fair to inform the aac are 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.310
 about that because if I had the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.720
 satisfaction to recover that photo 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 I was sure it was because of the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.180
 quality of the product I purchased 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.180
