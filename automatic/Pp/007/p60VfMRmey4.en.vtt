00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.550
 video girl tricks where i'm going to you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 present hairdressing tutorials for the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.420
 morning when we are offered on 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.040

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 hairstyles are suitable for all types of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.380
 hair so stayed with me to find out 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.910
 how for this first hairstyle 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.920
 you are going to need a rubber band 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 so at first we will come 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.930
 bring our hair so on top of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 head like this so I want my 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 hair with my hand and then I come 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.790
 applied so the the elastic around 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.170
 my hair to hold them 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.760
 I will come and shoot my hair 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.149
 on the sides to create an effect of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.370
 volume 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.460
 so this hairstyle is workable on 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.600
 long or medium hair 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.300
 Then I just have my locks for 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 really make a better effect so 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.910
 here are the very fast results very 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910
 simple and very chic 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.930
 so for this second tutorial I'm going 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.210
 bring my hair to the side of the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.200
 head and then I'll come make a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 very simple tail 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.970
 I will come then loosen it very 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.130
 so slightly with my fingers I'm going 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.500
 so create a small space between my 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.380
 hair and i'm going to bring so michael to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.870
 inside here and I serve them very 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.460
 slightly so I can also with 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.810
 my hands creates a volume effect so 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.650
 loosen a little tail in 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 height and that's the result 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.950
 to avoid loose hair at 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.870
 the back of my head I want to come 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.399

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.490
 at first I will come 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.149
 take a wick on the side of my head 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.130

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.459
 head 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.900

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.830
 at that moment I'm going to take a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.130
 little pin to be able to fix my 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.020
 hair in the back of the head when 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.630

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.550

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.550
