00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
I know it sounds disgusting but I figure

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.980 
I know it sounds disgusting but I figure
you<00:03:20.530> don't<00:03:20.770> really<00:03:21.190> taste<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.940> pasta<00:03:22.210> you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
you don't really taste the pasta you

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.440 
you don't really taste the pasta you
taste<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.380> texture<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.700> got<00:03:24.910> extra<00:03:25.060> firm

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
taste the texture so I got extra firm

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.660 
taste the texture so I got extra firm
tofu<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.680> lots<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.070> cheese<00:03:27.310> which<00:03:27.550> I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
tofu and I have lots of cheese which I

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.970 
tofu and I have lots of cheese which I
love<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.090> heavy<00:03:28.450> cream<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:29.890> going

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
love and heavy cream and so it's going

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.590 
love and heavy cream and so it's going
to<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.130> more<00:03:30.280> like<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.520> casserole<00:03:30.970> type<00:03:31.300> thing

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
to be more like a casserole type thing

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.250 
to be more like a casserole type thing
so<00:03:33.060> if<00:03:34.060> i<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.300> get<00:03:34.390> past<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.780> fact<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.050> it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
so if i can get past the fact that it's

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.850 
so if i can get past the fact that it's
tofu<00:03:35.710> then<00:03:36.370> i<00:03:37.000> might<00:03:37.240> actually<00:03:37.450> like<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:38.590> i
