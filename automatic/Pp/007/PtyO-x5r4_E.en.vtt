00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
explain how to go from here at the ridge

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.810 
explain how to go from here at the ridge
height<00:00:08.240> to<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.900> Clare<00:00:10.230> base<00:00:10.580> how<00:00:11.580> can

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
height to here to Clare base how can

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.910 
height to here to Clare base how can
that<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.000> achieved<00:00:12.509> well<00:00:12.900> let's<00:00:13.049> take<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.559> site

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
that be achieved well let's take a site

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.700 
that be achieved well let's take a site
known<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.429> my<00:00:14.880> cabin<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.660> instance<00:00:16.049> takes<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.330 
southwest wind the airs coming from the
Azores<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.570> what<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.840> tell<00:00:22.140> well<00:00:22.920> first<00:00:23.189> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
Azores so what can we tell well first of

of ridge lift on this particular day the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
of ridge lift on this particular day the
wind<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:35.130> coming<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> southeast<00:00:36.420> east

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and drifting over to the west so it's

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.670 
and drifting over to the west so it's
against<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> rules<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.960> Southwest

cold and red for warm or hot there the
thermal<00:00:54.600> activity<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.170> hardly<00:00:55.559> behind<00:00:55.860> those

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
thermal activity is hardly behind those

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.220 
thermal activity is hardly behind those
trees<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> air<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> bit

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
trees there it's in the air as a bit

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
trees there it's in the air as a bit
sheltered<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.370> heat<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.879> little<00:01:00.059> bit

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sheltered it can heat up a little bit

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
sheltered it can heat up a little bit
more<00:01:00.449> than<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> surrounding<00:01:01.230> air<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.559> that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
more than the surrounding air so that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.880 
more than the surrounding air so that
good<00:01:01.980> areas<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> find<00:01:02.670> thermals<00:01:03.439> the<00:01:04.439> pond

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
good areas to find thermals the pond

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
good areas to find thermals the pond
aerial<00:01:05.339> boggy<00:01:05.640> area<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.150> generally<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.810> little

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
aerial boggy area is generally a little

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.660 
aerial boggy area is generally a little
bit<00:01:07.409> cooler<00:01:07.799> than<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> surrounding<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
bit cooler than the surrounding it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
bit cooler than the surrounding it
around<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.930> thermal<00:01:10.320> activity

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
around there so thermal activity

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
around there so thermal activity
generally<00:01:11.340> takes<00:01:11.580> place<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.150> during<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
generally takes place here during the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.380 
generally takes place here during the
course<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> day<00:01:13.460> now<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.700> we've<00:01:14.909> done<00:01:14.939> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
course of the day now what we've done is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.749 
course of the day now what we've done is
I've<00:01:15.960> gone<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> Green<00:01:16.710> glider<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I've gone on the Green glider so if you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.179 
I've gone on the Green glider so if you
follow<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> yellow<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:19.110> me<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.770> Chris's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
follow the yellow that's me and Chris's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
follow the yellow that's me and Chris's
on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.549> white<00:01:20.729> I've<00:01:21.210> asked<00:01:21.689> him<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> keep<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
on the white I've asked him to keep to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
on the white I've asked him to keep to
my<00:01:22.350> left<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.860> when<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.610> turn<00:01:23.670> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
my left so when I make a right turn we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.080 
my left so when I make a right turn we
can<00:01:24.210> both<00:01:24.570> 360<00:01:25.380> together<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
can both 360 together and there on the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
can both 360 together and there on the
green<00:01:27.390> glider<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> Chris's<00:01:28.439> taking<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
green glider and Chris's taking the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
green glider and Chris's taking the
video<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.759> his<00:01:30.299> glider<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> thermal

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
video here on his glider so the thermal

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.690 
video here on his glider so the thermal
is<00:01:35.759> 1<00:01:36.240> 2<00:01:36.479> 3<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.290> start<00:01:37.619> small<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.549> they

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is 1 2 3 they start small and then they

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
is 1 2 3 they start small and then they
get<00:01:38.850> bigger<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.509> must<00:01:39.720> stay<00:01:39.960> inside<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
get bigger so we must stay inside that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
get bigger so we must stay inside that
thermal<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.460> near<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> ground<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.270> are

down<00:01:55.680> below<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> problem

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
down below but that's not a problem

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.810 
down below but that's not a problem
because<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:58.229> does<00:01:58.409> later<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:59.009> back<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because he does later come back in and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.190 
because he does later come back in and
you'll<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> video<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> moment

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you'll see that in the video in a moment

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469 
you'll see that in the video in a moment

the wind day and these thermal
activities<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.430> used<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.910> these

got a bank inside I could go tighter man

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.830 
got a bank inside I could go tighter man
but<00:03:03.450> I'd<00:03:03.570> cut<00:03:03.840> underside<00:03:04.350> Chris

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.330 

like<00:03:33.020> this<00:03:33.260> just<00:03:33.800> not<00:03:33.980> wholesome<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:34.490> broken

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
like this just not wholesome it's broken

like this just not wholesome it's broken
so<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.550> is<00:03:37.730> how<00:03:37.910> Chris<00:03:38.300> got<00:03:38.540> on<00:03:38.750> my<00:03:39.110> thing<00:03:39.320> he

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
so this is how Chris got on my thing he

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.560 
so this is how Chris got on my thing he
did<00:03:39.560> very<00:03:39.710> well<00:03:39.860> there's<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.400> top<00:03:40.640> amount<00:03:41.030> Cavin

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
did very well there's a top amount Cavin

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.750 
did very well there's a top amount Cavin
it's<00:03:42.230> plenty<00:03:42.560> people<00:03:42.860> sitting<00:03:43.250> there<00:03:43.280> so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
it's plenty people sitting there so

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.910 
it's plenty people sitting there so
chris<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.270> still<00:03:44.540> relatively<00:03:45.140> low<00:03:45.260> air<00:03:45.620> time

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
chris is still relatively low air time

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.830 
chris is still relatively low air time
I'm<00:03:46.490> not<00:03:46.700> sure<00:03:46.730> of<00:03:47.060> his<00:03:47.180> air<00:03:47.330> time<00:03:47.570> but

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
I'm not sure of his air time but

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.070 
I'm not sure of his air time but
probably<00:03:48.020> 3040<00:03:48.950> hours<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.370> guess<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.080> he's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
probably 3040 hours I guess and he's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.500 
probably 3040 hours I guess and he's
doing<00:03:51.290> really<00:03:51.380> well<00:03:51.620> considering<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.760> he's<00:03:53.300> up

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
doing really well considering so he's up

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.000 
doing really well considering so he's up
there<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.959> handful<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.560> other<00:03:54.890> people

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
there with a handful of other people

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.460 
there with a handful of other people
that<00:03:55.940> have<00:03:56.090> basically<00:03:56.390> taken<00:03:56.930> off<00:03:57.050> in<00:03:57.230> light

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
that have basically taken off in light

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.460 
that have basically taken off in light
winds<00:03:57.800> and<00:03:58.040> gone<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.640> thermal<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.690> you<00:04:00.350> know

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
winds and gone to thermal so you know

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.070 
winds and gone to thermal so you know
well<00:04:00.770> done<00:04:01.010> Chris<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.700> we'll<00:04:02.660> hopefully<00:04:02.870> see
