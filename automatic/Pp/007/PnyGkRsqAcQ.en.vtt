really<00:04:01.010> gotten<00:04:01.370> into<00:04:01.579> a<00:04:02.060> Call<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.569> Duty

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
really gotten into a Call of Duty

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.280 
really gotten into a Call of Duty
multiplayer<00:04:03.319> game<00:04:04.129> quite<00:04:05.000> like<00:04:05.329> black<00:04:05.659> ops<00:04:05.959> 2

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
multiplayer game quite like black ops 2

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.459 
multiplayer game quite like black ops 2
in<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.590> while<00:04:06.829> in<00:04:07.159> fact<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.849> think<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.659> really

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
in a while in fact I think that really

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.530 
in a while in fact I think that really
took<00:04:09.829> multiplayer<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.819> next<00:04:11.060> level<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.419> a

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
took multiplayer to the next level and a

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.780 
took multiplayer to the next level and a
lot<00:04:11.689> of<00:04:11.720> aspects<00:04:12.319> black<00:04:12.919> ops<00:04:13.189> 1<00:04:13.340> was

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
lot of aspects black ops 1 was

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.940 
lot of aspects black ops 1 was
phenomenal<00:04:14.419> for<00:04:14.629> multiplayer<00:04:15.139> and<00:04:15.439> it's<00:04:15.769> just

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
phenomenal for multiplayer and it's just

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.740 
phenomenal for multiplayer and it's just
proven<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.370> treyarch<00:04:17.000> knows<00:04:17.329> what<00:04:17.599> they're

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
proven that treyarch knows what they're

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.509

doing<00:04:17.930> when<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:18.259> comes<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.739> these<00:04:18.829> multiplayer

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
doing when it comes to these multiplayer

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.270 
doing when it comes to these multiplayer

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
this is pretty good and you got to give

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.830 
this is pretty good and you got to give
him<00:04:36.650> credit<00:04:36.710> though<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.669> jetpack<00:04:38.210> maneuvers

and<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.229> EXO<00:04:39.590> abilities<00:04:39.620> have<00:04:40.250> certainly

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
and the EXO abilities have certainly

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.420 
and the EXO abilities have certainly
added<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.120> whole<00:04:41.300> new<00:04:41.330> dynamic<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.770> look<00:04:43.099> for

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
added a whole new dynamic but I look for

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.149 
added a whole new dynamic but I look for
treyarch<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.389> go<00:04:44.930> back<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.289> call<00:04:45.530> duty<00:04:45.800> roots

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
treyarch to go back to call duty roots

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.860 
treyarch to go back to call duty roots
for<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.520> first<00:04:46.789> time<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.930> will<00:04:48.110> be<00:04:48.139> primed<00:04:48.620> in

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
for the first time it will be primed in

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.890 
for the first time it will be primed in
talking<00:04:50.870> about<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.770> next<00:04:52.340> gen<00:04:52.630> consoles<00:04:53.630> of

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
talking about the next gen consoles of

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.320 
talking about the next gen consoles of
the<00:04:54.110> date<00:04:54.289> so<00:04:55.039> it'll<00:04:55.580> be<00:04:55.610> interesting<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:56.180> see

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
the date so it'll be interesting to see

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.490 
the date so it'll be interesting to see
what<00:04:56.539> Trey<00:04:56.960> are<00:04:57.110> can<00:04:57.320> come<00:04:57.500> out

what Trey are can come out

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.710 
what Trey are can come out
full<00:04:59.250> three<00:04:59.580> years<00:04:59.820> is<00:05:00.180> going<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.510> guarantee

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
full three years is going to guarantee

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.920 
full three years is going to guarantee
that<00:05:01.710> we<00:05:01.890> might<00:05:02.130> have<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.910> best<00:05:03.210> call<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:03.690> duty

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
that we might have the best call of duty

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.120 
that we might have the best call of duty
of<00:05:04.650> all<00:05:04.920> time<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:06.150> me<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:06.630> black<00:05:07.050> ops<00:05:07.320> 2<00:05:07.620> so

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
of all time to me it's black ops 2 so

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.580 
of all time to me it's black ops 2 so
they<00:05:08.790> just<00:05:08.820> got<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.360> close<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.110> out<00:05:10.200> they<00:05:10.440> got

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
they just got to close it out they got

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.350 
they just got to close it out they got
to<00:05:10.740> give<00:05:10.860> us<00:05:10.980> an<00:05:11.310> improvement<00:05:11.670> on<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:11.910> next<00:05:12.270> in

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
to give us an improvement on the next in

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.240 
to give us an improvement on the next in
tolleson<00:05:12.660> point<00:05:12.990> yeah<00:05:13.440> definitely<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.100> I

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
tolleson point yeah definitely and I

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.180 
tolleson point yeah definitely and I
think<00:05:14.550> they're<00:05:14.700> very<00:05:14.730> capable<00:05:15.510> that

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
think they're very capable that

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.800 
think they're very capable that
especially<00:05:17.190> with<00:05:17.310> three<00:05:17.580> years<00:05:17.850> that's<00:05:18.480> for

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
especially with three years that's for

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.800 
especially with three years that's for
sure<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:19.980> have<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.670> next<00:05:21.090> call<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.360> duty

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
sure so you have the next call of duty

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.090 
sure so you have the next call of duty
game<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.410> series<00:05:22.680> being<00:05:23.670> developed<00:05:24.150> by

game in the series being developed by
treyarch<00:05:26.100> guys<00:05:26.460> this<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.090> huge<00:05:27.570> news<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.440> mean

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
treyarch guys this is a huge news I mean

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.200 
treyarch guys this is a huge news I mean
we<00:05:28.740> already<00:05:28.950> knew<00:05:29.250> this<00:05:29.430> but<00:05:29.670> it<00:05:29.790> has<00:05:29.940> been

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
we already knew this but it has been

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.510 
we already knew this but it has been
officially<00:05:30.510> confirmed<00:05:30.840> they<00:05:31.650> had<00:05:31.919> extra<00:05:32.490> time

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
officially confirmed they had extra time

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.190 
officially confirmed they had extra time
to<00:05:33.510> work<00:05:33.720> on<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.169> game<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.940> think<00:05:36.660> we<00:05:37.050> can

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
to work on the game so I think we can

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.310 
to work on the game so I think we can
expect<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:38.100> best<00:05:38.310> Call<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.700> Duty<00:05:39.180> yet<00:05:39.419> will<00:05:40.169> be

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
expect the best Call of Duty yet will be

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.470 
expect the best Call of Duty yet will be
hyping<00:05:40.770> it<00:05:40.830> up<00:05:40.980> and<00:05:41.220> breaking<00:05:41.730> it<00:05:42.000> down<00:05:42.030> more

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
hyping it up and breaking it down more

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.770 
hyping it up and breaking it down more
