00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 Courage to sit down with you is crazy. 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.650
 crazy is actually what most told me 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.219
 what the truth is the name 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.219
 Someone watched it spinning. 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.480
 she lay on his bed was not in my 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.690
 mother of all calm of who

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.829
 [Applause] 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:01:25.170
 the open mouth 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.600
 Look only after how 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.470
 How did we leave, roberta? 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 wake up 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.969
 Diallo went behind you to take a juice 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.399
 of grape 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:01.939
 I knew he was going to drop out of school. 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:04.729
 past now find themselves the hard way sure 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.770
 I'm sure that little has been seen 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.090
 his face looking at you or even repairing 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:19.989
 only you did not notice because I was 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:22.519
 watching you hit security is gone 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.799
 and he went away because he had to 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.510
 end the minutes that ended this very 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.110
 hard this guy you do not have to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.110
 swallow anything 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:45.090
 [Music] 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.620
 I did not know what I did not know 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.959
 could do with me 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:03:00.120
 I did not do the domino that will invest wrong 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:03:02.370
 they soon met because it was not the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.730
 when I shot and saw myself in the mirror 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.700
 had aged was drunk 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.090
 I did not know how to wear dominoes that 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.970
 I threw away the mask and slept in the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:23.540
 dressing room as a dog tolerated by the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.540
 sublime management 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.220
 [Music] 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.220
 does anyone know what this means 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.220
 are real or only projections are defined 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.220
 to the world 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.109
 For example, nothing will ever be anything 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:03.990
 I can not even want anything out of it. 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:05.170
 I'm right, you just fired. 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:13.090
 [Music] 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:14.650

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.160
 one of them 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.200
 deep down I do not forgive myself helbing 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.300
 You do not have to forgive. 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:29.139
 something the rain is on account of 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:31.780
 from his girlfriend since 1957 when she 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.610
 Rarely said rahman razak visited the year 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.380
 never lost another neighborhood corner never 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.340
 I lose myself white will lock in another 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.090
