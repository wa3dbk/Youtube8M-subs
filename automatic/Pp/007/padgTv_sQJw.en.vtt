00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:02.924
MIKE: You guys just don't get it.

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.059
DAVE: You're just thinking
about it too much.

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:09.030
MIKE: Oh, and what are YOU
thinking about, Socrates?

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.033
DAVE: Well, now you've got me
thinking about the Combine.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.902
MIKE: Yeah, and how they need a
better name, right?

00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:18.072
DAVE: No. I mean, if we should
really be working for them.

00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:21.509
MIKE: I don't see why not. If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.580
Besides, with our job skills, what's
the alternative? Garbage collector?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.015
DAVE: Well, we could
always join the rebels.

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:30.918
MIKE: Oh, please! The rebels are idiots.

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:32.186
DAVE: What makes you say that?

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:34.822
MIKE: Because they're
all heart and no brain.

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:36.157
If you look at the big picture,

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:39.727
they may as well be fighting the
aliens with Nerf ball guns.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:41.429
DAVE: Oh, it can't be that bad.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.565
They wouldn't be fighting if
they didn't think they had a chance.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.434
MIKE: I understand where
they're coming from.

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:50.438
Nobody's holding hands and singing "Joy
to the World" since the aliens showed up

00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:53.841
and kicked our ass, but let's
look at the facts:

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.011
the aliens conquered us in a
matter of hours!

00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:59.113
The entire planet!

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:02.650
Isn't that what we call the
invasion now? "The Seven Hour War"?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.951
You know why?

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:05.186
DAVE: Because it lasted sev--

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:08.356
MIKE: Because it lasted seven
hours, that's why!

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:10.992
Most people are at work longer than that.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:15.429
That means that in less time than it takes
for Joe Average to clock in and clock out

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.132
at the office, the aliens
conquered the whole Earth,

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:20.468
whereas all Joe did was make
some spreadsheets.

00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:22.570
MIKE: Well, that's because they
caught us off-guard.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.873
DAVE: Okay, let's say we were
ready for them. Then what?

00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:27.942
We'd call it "The Ten Hour War"?

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.578
They tore into us like a pack of wolves.

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:32.713
The rebels just aren't
doing the math on this.

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:36.651
Look, who has more fighters?
The rebels or the aliens?

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:38.319
DAVE: The aliens?

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.389
MIKE: Who has more resources?

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:42.690
DAVE: The aliens.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.726
MIKE: Who has WAY better technology?

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:47.762
DAVE: Yeah, I see your point.

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:49.864
Hey, I got a stupid question.

00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:50.831
MIKE: What's that?

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:53.100
MIKE: What do the Combine
look like, anyway?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.771
MIKE: Y'know, I'm not sure either.
That's how good they are.

00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.174
It's not like they showed up
themselves to conquer the Earth.

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:05.012
No, they were kicking it back at
their homeworld, sipping alien martinis

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:07.314
while they sent another alien race

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:12.720
they had already conquered to
come conquer us FOR THEM!

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.789
Now that's just slick.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.058
DAVE: Wow, and now we're working for them.

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:20.628
MIKE: Yep. It's the pyramid
scheme from hell.

00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:23.397
So, you still want to join the rebels?

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:26.667
DAVE: Maybe not. You're making
them sound stupid.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:31.772
MIKE: Yeah, well, I think cows are stupid,
too. But does it make them stupid?

00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:33.541
DAVE: Yeah, wait... what?!

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.077
MIKE: Forget it. Just think about
things before you go and--

00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:37.411
DAVE: Hey, check it out.

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.312
MIKE: What?

00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:39.280
DAVE: Another pigeon.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.716
MIKE: Sweet. It's my turn, isn't it?

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:42.717
DAVE: Yeah, I think so.

00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:43.984
MIKE: You see anybody coming?

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.019
DAVE: Nah, I think you're good.

00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:47.121
MIKE: Okay, pigeon.

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:49.623
You're mine!

00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:50.858
Ready...

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:52.159
Aim...

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.960
DAVE: OH MY GOD, LOOK OUT!

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.394
MIKE: (screams)

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:57.765
You ASS!

00:02:57.765 --> 00:02:59.366
DAVE: Ha ha. You suck.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:00.968
Here, let me show you how it's done.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.207
MIKE: Damn!

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:09.043
How'd you get to be such a good shot?

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.445
DAVE: Just lots of time down at the range.

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:14.849
I find it's easier when you tape
people's faces over the targets.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.485
Hell, I even used yours a couple times.

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:19.453
I usually blow out the face of
the target, though,

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:23.090
so, I just bring them home and
draw smiley faces in the gaps

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.658
and use it to decorate my apartment.

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:25.693
[thumping sounds]

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:26.761
MIKE: Thanks for sharing that, Dave.

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.730
It's good to know you're not
psycho or anything.

00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:32.233
DAVE: Pew. Pewpewpewpewpew!

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:32.800
[thumping sounds]

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.235
MIKE: Hey, can you hear that?

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:35.736
DAVE: Yeah, that's me, silly.

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:37.438
MIKE: No, that deeper sound.

00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:49.216
[thumping sounds]

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.452
[strider calls]

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.523
MIKE: I, uh, think we've got a problem.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.859
DAVE: What do you think it wants?

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.495
MIKE: I... don't know.

00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:03.831
Why is it just staring at us?

00:04:04.698 --> 00:04:05.933
DAVE: I don't know either.

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.302
Heh heh, hey, I dare you to shoot it.

00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:10.271
MIKE: No, I'm not going to shoot it!

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:13.841
DAVE: Chicken! Bok-bok-bok-bok... bkaw!

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:17.111
[strider roars]

00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:20.080
MIKE: Hey, Dave, here's a better idea:

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.517
how about YOU shoot it and I'll
run away and hide?

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:24.919
DAVE: Bok-kaw!

00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:30.624
MIKE: Maybe we shouldn't
have shot the pigeon.

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:33.828
DAVE: Excuse me, I shot the pigeon!

00:04:33.828 --> 00:04:37.097
You shot up the windows over
there, you lunatic.

00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:39.233
MIKE: I wouldn't if you hadn't scared me!

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:42.736
DAVE: Oh, quit complaining. This
thing is probably going to kill you anyway.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:46.207
MIKE: Hey, if it kills me, it's
going to kill you, too.

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:49.009
I don't know why you sound
so calm about this.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.416
DAVE: Of course it won't. Big
alien... robot... things... love me!

00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:58.118
I mean, look at him, he's just
a big friendly guy.

00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.321
MIKE: Dave, this isn't a stray dog.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.423
DAVE: I shall call you Simba.

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:05.392
[Dave whistles the 5 pipe tones
from Close Encounters of the Third Kind]

00:05:05.392 --> 00:05:06.927
MIKE: What's that?

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:08.529
DAVE: An alien greeting.

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.598
MIKE: Wait... no, it's not!

00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:11.966
That's from a movie.

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:14.101
That's not going to help us!

00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:17.204
DAVE: Of course it will! Simba
understands what I'm saying.

00:05:17.204 --> 00:05:18.505
Isn't that right, Simba?

00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:21.108
Watch.

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.577
[Dave whistles the 5 pipe tones
from Close Encounters of the Third Kind]

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:29.516
MIKE: All right, I'm going to
start walking away slowly.

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:33.854
If you want to do your snake-charming
routine there, knock yourself out.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:40.561
Okay, maybe not.

00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:41.595
[Dave whistles the first 3 pipe tones
from Close Encounters of the Third Kind]

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:42.696
[strider finishes the last 2 pipe tones]
DAVE: Ah-hah!

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:44.064
MIKE: Hey, look out! IT'S GONNA--

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.300
WAAAAAAAHHHH!

00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:48.903
DAVE: Oops.

00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:51.105
Mike! You okay?!

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:55.242
Now, that wasn't very nice. Bad Simba!

00:05:55.242 --> 00:05:57.845
[strider whines]

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.313
DAVE: Mike?!

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:02.516
MIKE: Dave!

00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:04.418
DAVE: Yeah?

00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:08.255
MIKE: You're dead!
...as soon as I can walk again.

00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:10.090
[strider whistles the last 2 pipe tones]

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.267
DAVE: Quiet, Simba.

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:12.634
