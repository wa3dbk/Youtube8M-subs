00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.350 

but<00:00:32.739> first<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.309> all<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:33.640> should<00:00:33.850> take<00:00:34.089> a<00:00:34.120> look

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
but first of all you should take a look

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.569 
but first of all you should take a look
at<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.899> direction<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.769> spin<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.370> bars

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
at the direction you spin the bars

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.389 
at the direction you spin the bars
because<00:00:37.479> when<00:00:37.750> your<00:00:37.960> left<00:00:38.229> foot<00:00:38.440> forward<00:00:38.620> you

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
because when your left foot forward you

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.490 
because when your left foot forward you
should<00:00:39.640> throw<00:00:39.909> the<00:00:40.210> bars<00:00:40.449> with<00:00:41.019> your<00:00:41.050> left

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
should throw the bars with your left

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.350

and<00:00:43.540> if<00:00:44.530> your<00:00:44.769> right<00:00:45.220> foot<00:00:45.460> forward<00:00:45.670> you

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
and if your right foot forward you

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.270 
and if your right foot forward you
should<00:00:46.540> throw<00:00:46.870> them<00:00:47.199> clockwise<00:00:47.559> with<00:00:48.159> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
should throw them clockwise with the

important to you now but if you want to

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.829 
important to you now but if you want to
combine<00:00:55.869> parchments<00:00:56.860> and<00:00:57.009> rotations<00:00:57.519> later

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
combine parchments and rotations later

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.560 
combine parchments and rotations later
it's<00:00:58.839> easier<00:00:59.439> for<00:00:59.769> you<00:00:59.920> if<00:00:59.949> you<00:01:00.339> spin<00:01:01.180> them<00:01:01.360> the

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
it's easier for you if you spin them the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.079 
it's easier for you if you spin them the
right<00:01:01.750> way<00:01:01.780> now<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.220> easiest<00:01:03.369> way<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.879> learn

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
right way now the easiest way to learn

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.999 
non-throwing hand of the bars right at
the<00:01:18.369> beginning<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:20.259> don't<00:01:20.619> want<00:01:20.890> to

you<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.380> spin<00:02:15.829> like<00:02:15.860> 90<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:17.150> way<00:02:17.420> you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
you to spin like 90 that way you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.020 
you to spin like 90 that way you
probably<00:02:18.440> won't<00:02:18.920> hurt<00:02:19.190> yourself<00:02:19.579> and<00:02:19.880> you
