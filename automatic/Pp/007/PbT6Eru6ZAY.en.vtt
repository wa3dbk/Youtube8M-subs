00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Nine people today I show the times 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.109
 innovations from snapshot 12 42h and yes 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.109
 it's still wednesday today 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.830
 so this network and not many 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.169
 Updates the ball between the version 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.789
 1.4 come out and that's why 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.230
 already as a preview release here 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.329
 Today on Wednesday that is already 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.529
 appeared but it does not exist either 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.530
 many new things and the pointers 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.710
 nevertheless the first to angeles is a 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.879
 new crafting recipe that you believe 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.129
 I'm only 31 after my bill 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.840
 blocks of iron are needed 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.600
 needs three blocks and then you do 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.109
 that made iron in potsdam to the apple 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.480
 Also, there are now to the end, if 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.570
 if you pick a pick ax eight 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.589
 one item must be a one has the only 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.269
 still with a raw material namely 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.000
 times instead of a whole new one 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.979
 shovel and that we are good in green 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.720
 written and that costs less 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.260
 that means it only costs a single one 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.909
 level these to repair and if you can 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.500
 getting in the way even if you look at ours 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.579
 the victim finds and not the level 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 have indicated for the red and of course 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.860
 if you then enchanted his things 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.450
 you can also do this with one 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 only repair that costs then 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.979
 20 levels less than the other anyway 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.579
 if you rename them then then 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.930
 it costs a total of 22 levels, however 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.610
 that is also because that delivered 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.289
 I would be the normal magic 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.590
 want to rename diamond shovel 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.289
 in what would I know what would be global then 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 It only cost me new levels here 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.950
 the same applies again 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.359
 You can, as I said with a single 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.100
 item to improve that 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.920
 also with armor what I did not before 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.380
 Furthermore, there is something here 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.960
 to redstone because so you can like 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.640
 but always activate something before 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.310
 You can now also lock the pure 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.189
 because if you activate it and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 another repeater is working on it and 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.060
 This activates come to a bedrock 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.640
 lock in there as you can see and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.800
 then it will not be disabled because 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.660
 The lock in it is the same 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700
 of course, but also if it is 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.450
 it disabled the lock cleansed 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.270
 it will not be activated 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.819
 then there is something else newest 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.480
 bats and activate them 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.060
 now no plates no tripwire 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.459
 and make new wheat or something 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.040
 So always do not plant your plants anymore 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.819
 broken and that was actually no 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.680
 that was not it yet 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.200
 I can just think of it now 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.050
 hide his service when watching videos 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.220
 But here, for example, it does that 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.239
 then go on talking and then you can 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.190
 show them 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.530
 she should net games or you can 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.380
 hide them again that was it 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.630
 but not for slapshot 12 442 year 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.290
 so many innovations but that's just 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.819
 because the version 1.4 already on 24 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.170
 should come out and I wish you 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.090
 still have fun with him already 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.510
 the 1.4 when I want to play around times 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.510
 and ciao
