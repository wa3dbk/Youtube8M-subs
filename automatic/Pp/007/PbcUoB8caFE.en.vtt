00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.640
 because there are people today I'm going to 

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:08.700
 teach the pain ist parrot list is when 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.690
 you pick up two cards and you make it look like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.690
 as if it is not now 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.420
 when you get to the tutorial 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.129
 I will teach the theory is that I believe 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.650
 which is the most convincing that is the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.650
 double led for push I know you use the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.589
 most wizards worth you have what 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.799
 is to push the letters from above you take 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.199
 the first two reds with your thumb and 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.839
 what you do is worth it and the way in which 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.689
 this is done is that you take your deck and in 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.729
 the mechanical rip is when and a half there 

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:03.059
 up these three here and the thumb guide 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:06.060
 and these three fingers that are here 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.130
 on the side they are going to be like almost 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 up everything in the deck and the when 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.900
 you have the deck no no, it's not going to push 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 all the letters but only those of 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.330
 up because those three of them are going to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.910
 be preventing you from pushing any more 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.620
 who with the middle finger 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.170
 right because you win with your hand 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.360
 left you're going to look for the first two 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.630
 cards are you have to carry the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.630
 first two letters and with this finger the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.180
 I pick and pushed them against the skin 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.550
 under my thumb you push them like 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.070
 nailing them there and then but as 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.690
 you see here you still see a separation and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.960
 to solve that what I do is that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.810
 he pushed the cards with my thumb okay 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.610
 those who are far away diets by 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.700
 up here and on the side thanks to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.440
 middle finger of the thumb and then without 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.920
 remove the letter of piety from your 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.770
 thumb 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.229
 do not do no tube do not do so 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.910
 because it's not easier for you to see a 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.610
 desaparaciÃ³n little that jumped 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.850
 you do little like that and you push them against the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.890
 l as skin and everything in between thumb and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.980
 using the skin as a pivot point the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.570
 you are turning and you have the letter folded and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.580
 what it does is to have the letter folded is 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.600
 that is not seen in the separation between 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.690
 two cards but lecterns is golden 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.150
 would be more the separation or if 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.480
 I'm from another angle would come something 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.459
 so you have again push the ones in 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.300
 above all when you get half 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.670
 thumb pushes and using the skin underneath 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.760
 of your thumb as a pivot you have it like that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.370
 it's worth it and your index is holding it 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.640
 down and making it easier to donate 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.319
 but that thumb recount throughout the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.380
 medium and after the index you put it here 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.239
 and then you're going to fold the letter and 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.370
 then if you only have to 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.830
 teach and put it back then very well 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.269
 that already serves you directly but if 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.459
 you want to continue explaining while 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.100
 you have the letter what you are going to do is 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.110
 taking the letter and doing pressure with 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.459
 your index finger to follow 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.730
 doubling it and you can not see the 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.420
 separation you're going to put it between your thumb 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.730
 index and a half of the left hand and 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.950
 pressing with your thumb and from or in 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.450
 medium this is another one that keeping the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.540
 folded letter 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.540
 and so you do not see the separation and you have the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.750
 index up here and so while you can 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.099
 explain with the other hand again 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.870
 you push letters from above but push 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.840
 all the dice because you have these of 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.400
 here you take the first two you have to 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.380
 look at which are the first two and the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.840
 you take with the middle finger 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.019
 the push against the skin of here 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.420
 block with your thumb and tour with your 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.870
 index below the tours on the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.430
 skin bending the after you take it 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.950
 pressing to have it also a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.500
 little bent and you put it with your thumb 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.349
 index and of or middle of the left hand 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.540
 which is the one that is holding the deck and 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.340
 makes expression with this 2 and this finger 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.200
 to keep it folded 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.329
 then I will choose the letter and turn 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.670
 the like this and act like the mind is 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.010
 half snap your fingers and make 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.599
 appears above the double the iltre is a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.810
 of the techniques that I think there's more 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:21.280
 what to practice and what is used in more tricks 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.680
 of cards than any other technique 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.630
 good bye today the three bites and as 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.630
 always aspires to confuse
