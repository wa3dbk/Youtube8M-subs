abstract<00:01:26.930> design<00:01:27.440> which<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.799> really<00:01:28.190> really

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
abstract design which I really really

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.520 
abstract design which I really really
like<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:29.960> something<00:01:30.170> different

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
and I'm going to go ahead and aim for

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.899 
and I'm going to go ahead and aim for
the<00:01:33.320> center<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.950> i<00:01:33.979> can<00:01:34.159> pick<00:01:34.369> up<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.670> dark

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
yellow i do it at the angle slightly and

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.679 
yellow i do it at the angle slightly and
then<00:01:47.540> clean<00:01:47.960> up<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.259> surface

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
middle so now we're ready to draw our

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.780 
middle so now we're ready to draw our
pattern<00:04:12.720> since<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.800> for<00:04:14.040> some<00:04:14.280> Patrick's

Day<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:16.590> probably<00:04:16.859> already<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.430> what<00:04:17.640> I'm

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
Day you probably already know what I'm

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:28.220 
Day you probably already know what I'm
gonna<00:04:17.910> do<00:04:18.470> go<00:04:19.470> ahead<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.600> do<00:04:21.600> this

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.460 

now<00:04:28.980> this<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.280> already<00:04:29.670> a<00:04:29.820> for<00:04:30.420> clover<00:04:30.840> but

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
now this is already a for clover but

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.620 
now this is already a for clover but
what<00:04:31.740> I'm<00:04:31.830> going<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.040> do<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:35.300> do<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:38.420> so<00:04:39.420> that
