00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.409
 way your goal number 30 in is ok league 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.840
 after the break dani lopez gave the 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:18.370
 tranquility to the men of 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:21.159
 local coach was several in 49 in 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.050

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.770
 the desperate attacked is a little more 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.080
 center without goalkeeper and danny lópez 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.940

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.440
 We listen to it several valuation 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.270
 very positive of the party I think it has

 it was very difficult to play after 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.630
 three weeks of inactivity I think the 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.490
 team has been very good this way 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.780
 has known how to take the right tension and 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.050
 obviously very happy for the three 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.980
