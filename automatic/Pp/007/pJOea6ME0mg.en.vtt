business has gotten so uh he's gotten so
worse<00:00:11.219> it's<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.790> spotty

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
worse it's so spotty

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.770 
worse it's so spotty
you<00:00:13.679> know<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> business<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.120> real<00:00:15.389> spot

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
you know like the business is real spot

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.890 
you know like the business is real spot
in<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.970> that's<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.630> nobody's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
fault it's just I think it's just the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900 
fault it's just I think it's just the
evolution<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.380> what's<00:00:23.220> happened<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:23.820> at
