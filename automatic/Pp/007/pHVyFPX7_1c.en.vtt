here's<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.000> quick<00:00:06.180> reminder<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.690> how<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> fill

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
here's a quick reminder of how to fill

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.629 
here's a quick reminder of how to fill
them<00:00:12.590> spring<00:00:13.590> rolls<00:00:13.830> are<00:00:13.980> essentially<00:00:14.400> Thai

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
them spring rolls are essentially Thai

them spring rolls are essentially Thai
Street<00:00:15.000> food<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:16.020> you're<00:00:16.170> using<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.560> concept

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
Street food so you're using the concept

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.590 
Street food so you're using the concept
of<00:00:17.250> perhaps<00:00:17.760> leftovers<00:00:18.359> from<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> night

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of perhaps leftovers from the night

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.019 
of perhaps leftovers from the night
before<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.609> putting<00:00:20.609> them<00:00:20.789> into<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
before and just putting them into a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.570 
before and just putting them into a
pastry<00:00:21.619> deep<00:00:22.619> frying<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> then

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
pastry deep frying them and then

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.120 
pastry deep frying them and then
actually<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.150> gives<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.960> different<00:00:25.619> dish

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
actually that gives you a different dish

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.750 
actually that gives you a different dish
to<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:27.119> over<00:00:27.570> leftovers<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.550> haven't

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to use over leftovers now if you haven't

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
to use over leftovers now if you haven't
got<00:00:29.939> leftovers<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:30.750> quite<00:00:31.080> simply<00:00:31.500> put

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
got leftovers then quite simply put

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
got leftovers then quite simply put
something<00:00:32.610> together<00:00:32.730> which<00:00:33.270> could<00:00:33.480> be

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
something together which could be

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.310 
something together which could be
shredded<00:00:34.290> vegetables<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.190> some<00:00:35.700> tofu

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
shredded vegetables and some tofu

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.959 
shredded vegetables and some tofu
mushroom<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.860> perhaps<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.460> shredded

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
mushroom or perhaps some shredded

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
mushroom or perhaps some shredded
chicken<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.450> broth<00:00:39.950> I've<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.370> grilling

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
chicken or broth I've got my grilling

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
chicken or broth I've got my grilling
here<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.260> we're<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.680> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
here and then what we're going to do is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
here and then what we're going to do is
place<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> spring<00:00:45.360> roll<00:00:45.570> sheet

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
place that on to the spring roll sheet

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.490 
place that on to the spring roll sheet
which<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:49.050> thin

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
which is here now it's a very thin

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.959 
which is here now it's a very thin
machine<00:00:50.010> rolled<00:00:50.280> pastry

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
machine rolled pastry

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.560 
machine rolled pastry
much<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.050> look<00:00:52.829> let's<00:00:53.219> say<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.550> below<00:00:54.090> but

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
much like in look let's say as below but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
much like in look let's say as below but
actually<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.050> texture<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> quite<00:00:55.890> different

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
actually it's texture is quite different

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
actually it's texture is quite different
much<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.090> elastic<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.289> very

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
much more elastic which will be very

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
much more elastic which will be very
useful<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:58.920> were<00:00:59.160> rolling<00:00:59.719> we<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:00.899> need<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
useful when were rolling we then need to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
useful when were rolling we then need to
create<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:02.219> edible<00:01:02.699> glue<00:01:03.090> which<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.719> then

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
create a an edible glue which will then

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.710 
create a an edible glue which will then
allow<00:01:03.899> us<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.589> seal<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.129> edges<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.540> going

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
allow us to seal the edges so I'm going

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.510 
allow us to seal the edges so I'm going
to<00:01:06.780> start<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.380> taking<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.860> couple<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to start by taking a couple of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.469 
to start by taking a couple of
tablespoons<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.420> plain<00:01:10.110> white<00:01:10.619> flour<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
tablespoons of plain white flour and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.520 
tablespoons of plain white flour and
then<00:01:12.479> adding<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.200> cold<00:01:13.650> water<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
then adding some cold water to this and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
then adding some cold water to this and
really<00:01:16.530> creating<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> paste<00:01:17.490> into<00:01:17.909> perhaps

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
really creating a paste into perhaps

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
really creating a paste into perhaps
something<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.470> resembles<00:01:19.950> Yorkshire

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
something that resembles Yorkshire

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.520 
something that resembles Yorkshire
pudding<00:01:20.820> mix<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.450> perhaps<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:23.090> pancakes

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
pudding mix or perhaps out pancakes

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
pudding mix or perhaps out pancakes
pancake<00:01:25.530> mix<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.130> should<00:01:26.310> say<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.810> give

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
pancake mix I should say and just give

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
pancake mix I should say and just give
it<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.380> good<00:01:28.530> whisk<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.400> quite<00:01:29.610> robust

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it a really good whisk be quite robust

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
it a really good whisk be quite robust
so<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.110> nice<00:01:31.470> smooth<00:01:31.920> paste

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
so that you get a nice smooth paste

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
so that you get a nice smooth paste
needs<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:34.259> thick<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.009> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
needs to be really thick so that it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.590 
needs to be really thick so that it's
quite<00:01:35.430> glue<00:01:36.030> still<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
quite glue still that's the kind of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.240 
quite glue still that's the kind of
viscosity

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
viscosity

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
viscosity
well<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> place<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.780> pastry

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
well then going to place the pastry

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.440 
well then going to place the pastry
sheet<00:01:43.829> diagonally<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.180> front<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.660 

couple<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.540> tablespoons<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.130> filling

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.399 

don't<00:01:54.670> go<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.940> magic<00:01:55.570> might<00:01:55.750> be<00:01:55.900> tempting<00:01:56.380> to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
don't go to magic might be tempting to

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.350 
don't go to magic might be tempting to
put<00:01:56.680> what<00:01:56.830> you're<00:01:56.979> filling<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.940> do<00:01:58.150> need

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
put what you're filling it you do need

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.670 
put what you're filling it you do need
to<00:01:58.479> bring<00:01:58.600> them<00:01:58.840> together<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.409> if<00:01:59.530> it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
to bring them together and if it's

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.710 
to bring them together and if it's
overfilled<00:02:00.550> then<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.909> will<00:02:01.030> become<00:02:01.150> too<00:02:01.509> bulky

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
overfilled then it will become too bulky

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.260 
overfilled then it will become too bulky
and<00:02:02.110> then<00:02:02.799> we're<00:02:03.009> going<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.280> pick<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.880> up<00:02:03.940> and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and then we're going to pick this up and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.830 
and then we're going to pick this up and
take<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.170> right<00:02:05.560> across<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.369> top<00:02:06.840> pull

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
take it right across to the top pull

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.719 
take it right across to the top pull
this<00:02:08.110> back<00:02:08.410> you're<00:02:08.890> creating<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.459> little<00:02:09.640> bit

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
