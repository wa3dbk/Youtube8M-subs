00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
foundation on which kind of helps to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that most of you would probably just go

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110 
over that under eye area with some
concealer<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.739> hide<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> darkness<00:00:38.579> which

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
concealer to hide the darkness which

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360 
concealer to hide the darkness which
does<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.780> difference<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:41.280> be

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
does make a difference but it could be

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.600 
does make a difference but it could be
better<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> here's<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.620> happened<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.100> got
