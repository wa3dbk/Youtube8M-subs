00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.330
 City is 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.780
 This time is the story of the passive solar house Two major types of Eve solar house 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.320
 There 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.030
 one 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.030
 At the time of active solar house performed using machinery 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.560
 the other one is 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.730
 Do not use Thailand, but do it with the architectural method 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 It is a sig solar house 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.710
 ec should be passive solar 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.710
 Of course it is passive solar because it is passive or cycle 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.950
 From 1979 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 As the first full-scale solar house to drink 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.860
 We carry out 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.220
 ac housing has talked so far 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.720
 Air flows in the wall 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.610
 2 choices 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.220
 Air flowing in this wall 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 Winter is when you are allowed to warm 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.580
 Summer 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:20.090
 If cool air can flow 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:26.110
 Winter warm summer cool house is natural It can not be done by energy 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:29.170
 From such an idea eac's passive solar house is born 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.830
 Built how the mechanism of concrete house 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.870
 I will try to give up to which series 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.190
 In the case of a solar house 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.800
 Air flowing into this wall 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:49.750
 In the form of switching the flow 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.420
 I also express the house that the clothes town can do 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.870
 Winter is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.310
 No good wall 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.510
 ac collect your own matrix 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.250
 Heat collecting moon 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.270
 Collect solar heat in the heat collecting vent layer 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.009
 The raised lottery 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.009
 In the case of Air, Okabe Skymotive 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.750
 Summer 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:20.060
 vice versa 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:24.300
 The cool air of the night is still the power of the wind of the super own super high waist or the ventilation of the under floor vent 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.870
 The mechanism I used was the mechanism of wind enthusiasts 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.580
 From the floor 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.660
 Sink and I'm of the wall around the room in the wall 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:40.530
 The system that produces the super- high- raising place from the mechanism 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.530
 We created a system that cool whether it is building 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.220
 ac house clothes are vents and under floor vents at this super waist 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.080
 Summer is open 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.080
 That the Uyo close
