00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.840 
waiting on us when we get there and so
for<00:02:12.540> me<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.890> incredible

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
for me that is just an incredible

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.510 
for me that is just an incredible
blessing<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:16.140> such<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.710> great<00:02:16.950> feeling

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
blessing and it's such a great feeling

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.810 
blessing and it's such a great feeling
of<00:02:17.610> security<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.980> seemed<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
of security and it just seemed it's the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.880 
of security and it just seemed it's the
fact<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.390> we're<00:02:21.870> doing<00:02:22.260> what<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.620> Lord

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
fact that we're doing what the Lord

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.040 
fact that we're doing what the Lord
would<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.100> us<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.459> do<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:23.970> now<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.570> we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
would have us to do right now as we

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.430 
would have us to do right now as we
think<00:02:25.260> about<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.950> move<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.900> process

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
think about this move I think we process

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.940 
think about this move I think we process
it<00:02:28.620> differently<00:02:30.170> for<00:02:31.170> me<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.350> think<00:02:31.650> about<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
it differently for me I think about the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.150 
it differently for me I think about the
task<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:33.570> about<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.440> I'm<00:02:34.560> called<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.920> do

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
task I think about what I'm called to do

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.840 
task I think about what I'm called to do
and<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.870> think<00:02:36.959> about<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> details<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.700> know

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
try not to take the reigns as as we

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.259 
try not to take the reigns as as we
women<00:03:34.530> tend<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.040> do<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.430> want<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.910> control

women tend to do we want to control
everything<00:03:36.769> but<00:03:37.769> right<00:03:37.980> now<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> think<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.850> at

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
everything but right now I think it's at

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.449 
everything but right now I think it's at
this<00:03:39.450> juncture<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> move

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
this juncture in the move

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.660 
this juncture in the move
by<00:03:43.000> God's<00:03:43.239> grace<00:03:43.390> I'm<00:03:44.079> just<00:03:44.650> trusting<00:03:44.829> them<00:03:45.189> to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
by God's grace I'm just trusting them to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.009 
by God's grace I'm just trusting them to
to<00:03:46.299> move<00:03:46.599> us<00:03:46.780> forward<00:03:48.299> living<00:03:49.299> our<00:03:49.450> two<00:03:49.689> older

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
to move us forward living our two older

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.330 
to move us forward living our two older
children<00:03:50.290> behind<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:52.000> by<00:03:52.450> far<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.900> most

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
children behind is by far the most

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.140 
children behind is by far the most
difficult<00:03:54.340> aspect<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.359> this<00:03:55.810> move<00:03:56.049> for<00:03:56.349> us<00:03:57.150> we

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
difficult aspect of this move for us we

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.740 
difficult aspect of this move for us we
we<00:03:59.139> trust<00:03:59.500> God<00:03:59.709> we've<00:03:59.980> done<00:04:00.219> this<00:04:00.400> before

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
special memories for us so we'll miss

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.570 
special memories for us so we'll miss
that<00:06:11.340> but<00:06:12.330> by<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:12.600> same<00:06:12.870> token<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:14.340> only

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
that but by the same token the only

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.860 
that but by the same token the only
reason<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:14.880> we<00:06:15.120> were<00:06:15.240> able<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.510> have<00:06:15.660> those

reason that we were able to have those

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.300 
reason that we were able to have those
is<00:06:16.110> because<00:06:16.289> we<00:06:16.470> moved<00:06:16.650> from<00:06:16.830> another<00:06:17.160> house

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310

to this house so it's very exciting to

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.000 
to this house so it's very exciting to
think<00:06:20.580> about<00:06:20.850> the<00:06:21.180> memories<00:06:21.360> that<00:06:21.870> we<00:06:22.710> will

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
think about the memories that we will

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.189 
think about the memories that we will
create<00:06:23.310> in<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.270> place<00:06:24.479> that<00:06:24.510> we're<00:06:24.840> going<00:06:25.050> to

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
create in the place that we're going to

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:36.999 
create in the place that we're going to
wherever<00:06:25.949> that<00:06:26.190> may<00:06:26.370> be

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009
