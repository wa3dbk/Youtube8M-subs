00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
stop them you proxy the wave and then

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
stop them you proxy the wave and then
you<00:01:53.369> stand<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:53.939> they're<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.360> gonna<00:01:54.479> be

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
force them off the turret and they would

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.810 
force them off the turret and they would
have<00:02:01.890> been<00:02:01.979> able<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> snowball<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> game<00:02:02.790> a

have been able to snowball the game a
lot<00:02:03.030> harder<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:03.960> would've<00:02:04.110> been

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
lot harder and then they would've been

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.600

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
able to get to their strong mid game and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
able to get to their strong mid game and
potentially<00:02:06.180> overpowered<00:02:06.630> winter<00:02:06.810> Fox<00:02:07.020> but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

you're seeing the power of crit where

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.199 
you're seeing the power of crit where
you<00:04:20.040> can<00:04:20.190> break<00:04:20.430> through<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.820> movie<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.120> can

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.820 
you can break through the movie you can
break<00:04:21.390> through<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.660> Gragas<00:04:22.049> different

the f fever build did work in Game one
but<00:04:26.580> when<00:04:26.910> you

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
but when you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.040 
but when you
the<00:04:27.419> front<00:04:27.629> line<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:27.930> fast<00:04:29.539> you<00:04:30.539> know<00:04:30.629> CS<00:04:30.900> got

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
the front line that fast you know CS got

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.119 
the front line that fast you know CS got
all<00:04:31.169> tech<00:04:31.349> can<00:04:31.530> just<00:04:31.650> break<00:04:31.770> through<00:04:31.979> all<00:04:32.039> your

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
all tech can just break through all your

all tech can just break through all your
tanks<00:04:32.460> yeah<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.389> feel<00:04:33.660> like<00:04:33.690> this<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.050> one<00:04:34.199> of

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.379 
tanks yeah I feel like this is one of
those<00:04:34.349> scenarios<00:04:34.680> where<00:04:35.069> we<00:04:35.190> do<00:04:35.340> look<00:04:35.580> at<00:04:35.819> the

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
those scenarios where we do look at the

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.020 
those scenarios where we do look at the
Luigi<00:04:36.960> G<00:04:37.139> build<00:04:37.379> there<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.860> say<00:04:38.099> essence

Luigi G build there and say essence

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.719 
Luigi G build there and say essence
reaver<00:04:39.210> not<00:04:40.050> doing<00:04:40.620> exactly<00:04:41.159> what<00:04:41.340> they<00:04:41.550> need

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
reaver not doing exactly what they need

reaver not doing exactly what they need
is<00:04:41.909> you<00:04:42.030> mentioned<00:04:42.210> they<00:04:42.960> would<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.199> much

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
is you mentioned they would have much

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.439 
is you mentioned they would have much
rather<00:04:43.409> had<00:04:43.889> higher<00:04:44.159> burst<00:04:44.550> damage<00:04:44.759> there<00:04:45.150> get

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
rather had higher burst damage there get

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.939 
rather had higher burst damage there get
through<00:04:45.659> that<00:04:45.750> said<00:04:46.020> jawani<00:04:46.319> be<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> little<00:04:46.830> bit

through that said jawani be a little bit

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.640 
through that said jawani be a little bit
of<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.099> threat<00:04:47.370> but<00:04:47.789> beyond<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.120> even<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.930> have

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
of a threat but beyond that even I have

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
their decision to remain and fight when

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.089 
their decision to remain and fight when

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
there is the possibility after securing

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.980 
there is the possibility after securing

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
the bruiser type comp works if you

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.240 
the bruiser type comp works if you
actually<00:05:24.659> get<00:05:24.930> your<00:05:24.960> fight<00:05:25.259> set<00:05:25.560> up<00:05:25.710> but<00:05:25.889> right

a lot easier to fight alright well up in
the<00:05:41.130> top<00:05:41.310> when<00:05:41.520> we<00:05:41.639> saw<00:05:41.759> maokai<00:05:42.210> versus<00:05:42.630> mundo

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
the top when we saw maokai versus mundo

mundo very successful in the first game

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.510 
mundo very successful in the first game
for<00:05:45.360> TDK<00:05:45.779> a<00:05:45.990> little<00:05:46.560> bit<00:05:46.650> less<00:05:46.830> so<00:05:47.039> here<00:05:47.400> I

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
for TDK a little bit less so here I

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.249 
for TDK a little bit less so here I
wouldn't<00:05:47.880> say<00:05:48.029> that<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.330> loss<00:05:48.509> is<00:05:48.750> attributed

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
wouldn't say that the loss is attributed

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.170 
wouldn't say that the loss is attributed
to<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.529> moon<00:05:49.710> dough<00:05:49.860> but<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.370> think<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:51.150> next

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
to the moon dough but I think the next

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.399 
to the moon dough but I think the next
question<00:05:51.690> is<00:05:51.810> as<00:05:52.669> we've<00:05:53.669> noticed<00:05:54.169> Luigi<00:05:55.169> with

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
question is as we've noticed Luigi with

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.379 
question is as we've noticed Luigi with
the<00:05:55.500> potential<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.919> miss<00:05:56.130> position<00:05:56.669> where

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
the potential to miss position where

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.540 
the potential to miss position where
could<00:05:57.750> serif<00:05:58.169> go<00:05:58.349> in<00:05:58.529> the<00:05:58.620> top<00:05:58.860> lane<00:05:59.159> in<00:05:59.340> order

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
could serif go in the top lane in order

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.790 
could serif go in the top lane in order
to<00:05:59.639> put<00:05:59.819> himself<00:05:59.940> in<00:06:00.240> more<00:06:00.449> of<00:06:00.569> a<00:06:00.659> position<00:06:01.440> to

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
to put himself in more of a position to

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.370 
to put himself in more of a position to
outright<00:06:02.310> carry<00:06:02.699> the<00:06:02.909> game<00:06:03.120> if<00:06:03.419> Louie<00:06:03.990> gigi<00:06:04.349> is

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
outright carry the game if Louie gigi is

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.930 
outright carry the game if Louie gigi is
not<00:06:04.680> going<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.889> be<00:06:04.979> able<00:06:05.009> to<00:06:05.159> do<00:06:05.279> that<00:06:05.430> well<00:06:05.880> I

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
not going to be able to do that well I

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.040 
not going to be able to do that well I
think<00:06:06.029> the<00:06:06.210> two<00:06:06.330> biggest<00:06:06.509> pics<00:06:06.750> there<00:06:06.930> where

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
think the two biggest pics there where

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.230 
think the two biggest pics there where
the<00:06:07.169> Sivir<00:06:07.440> especially<00:06:08.190> for<00:06:08.430> TDK<00:06:08.909> and<00:06:09.090> the

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
the Sivir especially for TDK and the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.269 
the Sivir especially for TDK and the
cigs<00:06:09.509> the<00:06:09.779> cigs<00:06:09.960> allowed<00:06:10.169> publisher<00:06:10.919> to<00:06:11.039> scale

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
cigs the cigs allowed publisher to scale

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.279 
cigs the cigs allowed publisher to scale
super<00:06:11.580> well<00:06:11.729> in<00:06:11.969> the<00:06:12.120> late<00:06:12.270> game<00:06:12.479> and<00:06:12.719> the

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
super well in the late game and the

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.469 
super well in the late game and the
silver<00:06:13.500> was<00:06:13.680> just<00:06:13.830> huge<00:06:14.130> for<00:06:14.370> TDK<00:06:14.759> to<00:06:14.819> just

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
silver was just huge for TDK to just

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.149 
silver was just huge for TDK to just
press<00:06:15.960> all<00:06:16.110> tea<00:06:16.229> and<00:06:16.349> go<00:06:16.440> in<00:06:16.590> because<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:16.889> think

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
press all tea and go in because I think

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.350 
press all tea and go in because I think
when<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.400> have<00:06:17.550> something<00:06:17.819> as<00:06:18.000> simple<00:06:18.150> as

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
when you have something as simple as

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.719 
when you have something as simple as
several<00:06:19.110> t<00:06:19.259> like<00:06:19.770> any<00:06:19.949> team<00:06:20.219> can<00:06:20.370> just<00:06:20.550> be<00:06:20.610> like

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
several t like any team can just be like

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.610 
several t like any team can just be like
okay<00:06:20.849> severalty<00:06:21.330> even<00:06:21.630> in<00:06:21.719> soloq<00:06:22.110> several<00:06:22.529> T

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
okay severalty even in soloq several T

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.339 
okay severalty even in soloq several T
let's<00:06:22.800> go<00:06:22.919> in<00:06:23.099> and<00:06:23.279> if<00:06:23.880> Louie<00:06:24.419> GG<00:06:24.810> isnt<00:06:24.960> on<00:06:25.139> that

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
let's go in and if Louie GG isnt on that

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.659 
let's go in and if Louie GG isnt on that
then<00:06:25.590> they<00:06:25.740> don't<00:06:25.919> really<00:06:26.009> have<00:06:26.250> that<00:06:26.279> Go

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
then they don't really have that Go

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.909 
then they don't really have that Go
button<00:06:26.849> and<00:06:27.169> maybe<00:06:28.169> serif<00:06:28.590> might<00:06:28.740> need<00:06:28.860> to

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
button and maybe serif might need to

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:29.870 
button and maybe serif might need to
play<00:06:29.039> something<00:06:29.250> more<00:06:29.430> carry<00:06:29.610> on

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
play something more carry on

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.399 
play something more carry on
oriented<00:06:30.509> but<00:06:30.659> I<00:06:30.719> think<00:06:30.990> it<00:06:31.080> would<00:06:31.169> just<00:06:31.259> be

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
oriented but I think it would just be

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.019 
oriented but I think it would just be
better<00:06:31.560> to<00:06:31.830> stay<00:06:32.130> on<00:06:32.250> that<00:06:32.370> cinderhulk<00:06:32.729> tank

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
better to stay on that cinderhulk tank

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.939 
better to stay on that cinderhulk tank
stay<00:06:33.630> on<00:06:33.750> what<00:06:33.960> they<00:06:34.110> did<00:06:34.440> well<00:06:34.680> with<00:06:34.800> the

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
stay on what they did well with the

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.950 
stay on what they did well with the
first<00:06:35.130> game<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:35.520> really<00:06:36.120> prioritize<00:06:36.719> that

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
first game and really prioritize that

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.240 
first game and really prioritize that
silver<00:06:37.320> heavily<00:06:37.649> because<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:37.919> think<00:06:37.979> that's

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
silver heavily because I think that's

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.829 
silver heavily because I think that's
the<00:06:38.370> most<00:06:38.460> important<00:06:38.880> thing<00:06:38.909> for<00:06:39.000> TDK<00:06:39.449> alright

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
the most important thing for TDK alright

the most important thing for TDK alright
