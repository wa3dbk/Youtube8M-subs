00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.240 

we<00:02:19.410> even<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.800> music<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> shop<00:02:20.640> today<00:02:22.250> we

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
we even have music in the shop today we

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:34.740 
we even have music in the shop today we
don't<00:02:23.370> always<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.880> music

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:47.170 

when<00:02:35.380> she<00:02:35.530> could<00:02:35.680> feel<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:35.950> heat

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.930 

and<00:02:48.180> that's<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:48.990> as<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:50.190> burns<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.730> just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and that's it so as it burns you just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.750 
and that's it so as it burns you just
keep<00:02:51.600> raking<00:02:52.200> those<00:02:52.560> goals<00:02:52.890> forward<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
keep raking those goals forward and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.440 
keep raking those goals forward and
adding<00:02:54.330> wood<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.990> load<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:55.850> will<00:02:56.850> burn<00:02:57.090> for

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
adding wood and load it up will burn for

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.820 
adding wood and load it up will burn for
quite<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> while<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.470> it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
quite a while with it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.660 
quite a while with it
damper<00:02:59.250> down<00:03:00.860> actually<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.190> could<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.520> that

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
damper down actually we could do that

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.640 
damper down actually we could do that
once<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.060> get<00:03:03.450> some<00:03:03.840> fairly<00:03:04.080> convincing

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
once we get some fairly convincing

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.440 
once we get some fairly convincing
flames<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.220> could<00:03:05.400> close<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.820> draught<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
flames we could close the draught and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720 
flames we could close the draught and
let<00:03:07.050> them<00:03:07.230> see<00:03:07.440> how<00:03:07.470> quickly<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.160> flames<00:03:08.430> die

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
let them see how quickly the flames die

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:20.600 
let them see how quickly the flames die
down

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.370 

okay<00:03:21.210> why<00:03:21.360> don't<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.540> go<00:03:21.720> ahead<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.960> do<00:03:22.140> that

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.360 

see<00:03:25.380> how<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.590> changes<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:28.130> always<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.340> to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
see how it changes I always like to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:39.300 
see how it changes I always like to
leave<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:29.940> crack<00:03:30.900> open
