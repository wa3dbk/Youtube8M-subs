00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.650
 in our teacher grades and as you see 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.099
 we are in a special world I bring you 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.659
 the unboxing of a new laptop 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.160
 just today you know that I am a lot of 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:18.450
 wind waiting for why 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.580
 more than ever you have it today 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.970
 if you see why I do not have a little 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.840
 of making the house quite compared to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.580
 the pretty big box 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 and one waited until now because 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.270
 coach to pirlo and good 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 opening I'm saying 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.130
 to share with others is to play fairly 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.130
 all right 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.140
 we go there I hope it looks good 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.140
 in the camera 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.790
 i'm not 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.870
 good the laptop 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.870
 Well, no 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:16.060
 anyway 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.060
 the 15m and the processor that has 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 what it has is a last factory 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 ra is great 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.759
 it's a 5 but it's 4210 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.140
 and it's the fourth generation you'll be the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.260
 latest 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.590
 and it's much better for example the 17 the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.590
 money 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.810
 and then have I think that 8 gigs of ram 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.800
 in which he speaks 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.730
 the battery 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.730
 on the portal and not 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.250
 once this component 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.110
 if you have a meadow with that page I 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.130
 I do not recommend that the complexity of that 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.130
 page is totally reliable 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.580
 we close many days they are 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.530
 containing 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.530
 can go to games quietly 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.969
 It has a pretty good graphics too 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.969
 to nvidia the solution of your account 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.110
 the hard disk router has been deleted in 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.110
 your life so good 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.340
 we go there kids but I think that I 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.340
 as well 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.870
 it's super cute 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.150
 a paper over here 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:34.070
 exponent 5 the nvidia card 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.990
 the fine ones admired as a macbook 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.090
 For just to look at it is 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.530
 They are great after the screen 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.900
 also how can you put it 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.730
 the screen is completely vertical if 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.730
 you want a little effect 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.799
 this tourist 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.120
 in the battery 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.750
 load 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.019
 the characteristics 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.570
 what is being 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.800
 and for nothing, I hope that I have 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.990
 liked quite 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.400
 to 100% when the buenismo 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.520
 I would leave them under the page where 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.090
 we will see 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.720
 and everything 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.720
 variety 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.809
 how are you going to do forestry behind 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.169
 it's a pass I'm looking for laptops 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.940
 very cheap this way 550 percent 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.360
 in the same 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.360
 under which god
