00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
case they have a couple different

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.509 
case they have a couple different
versions<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> grip<00:00:14.280> case

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
versions of this this is a grip case

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.849 
versions of this this is a grip case
they<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.630> without<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.990> grip<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.500> but

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
they have one without the grip on it but

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.410 
they have one without the grip on it but
i<00:00:17.010> actually<00:00:17.220> prefer<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.850> ones<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.240> grip

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
i actually prefer the ones with the grip

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480 
i actually prefer the ones with the grip
because<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.869> adds<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.199> nice<00:00:19.410> little<00:00:19.710> aesthetic

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
because it adds a nice little aesthetic

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
because it adds a nice little aesthetic
appeal<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.029> plus<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> little<00:00:21.840> bit

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
appeal to it plus it's a little bit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.990 
appeal to it plus it's a little bit
easier<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.560> grip<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.400> does<00:00:23.550> fall<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
easier to grip and if it does fall it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.970 
easier to grip and if it does fall it
actually<00:00:24.390> does<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> give<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.769> sense

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
actually does kind of give you the sense

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.200 
actually does kind of give you the sense
of<00:00:26.189> there's<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.609> little<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:26.939> more

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
of there's going a little bit more

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.169 
of there's going a little bit more
protection<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.490> inside<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
protection to it on the inside of it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
protection to it on the inside of it
it's<00:00:30.510> all<00:00:30.720> rubberized<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> really<00:00:31.890> nice

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it's all rubberized which is really nice

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.970 
it's all rubberized which is really nice
so<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> damage<00:00:34.140> your<00:00:34.680> your

contact<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> surface<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
contact with the surface so that's a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
contact with the surface so that's a
very<00:01:17.640> good<00:01:17.909> feature<00:01:18.439> some<00:01:19.439> people<00:01:19.710> say<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
instead of it having all cut out if you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.490 
instead of it having all cut out if you
have<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.489> larger<00:02:21.000> headphone<00:02:21.540> jack<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.080> might

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
have a larger headphone jack it might

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380 
have a larger headphone jack it might
not<00:02:22.680> necessarily<00:02:22.920> fit<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.880> as<00:02:24.060> well<00:02:24.239> as
