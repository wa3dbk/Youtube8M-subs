00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.370
 no no 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:32.930
 and us even though we make music 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.360
 electronic that in your instrument of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.680
 quite different from the usual ones 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.780
 Magellanic musicians we are very local 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 in what sense that starting 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.750
 we do not use electronic music 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.610
 as a way to evade the place where 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.760
 we are totally the opposite or 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.290
 we are perhaps the electronic band less 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.540
 globalized 10 more pop that can 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 listening in chile would probably be 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.200
 practically impossible is not this that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.180
 we leave the complacent music I'll 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.340
 happy because the environment where we 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.640
 we basically work all year round in 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.930
 a sad gray environment and the realities 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 that we drive and the time we 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.990
 they come out are more or less grim 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.950
 It is a land that always demands 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.409
 much to man 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.860
 and for this reason we have a very 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 conditioned by the power of the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 nature 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.310
 and the technology here has served to make 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.310
 do not survive 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.920
 and what we do some way 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.010
 is to tell the same story they told 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.310
 folk groups of the year 60 as 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.990
 height in certain other as more current 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.800
 charm of the guard 4 patagonia cuadra 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.290
 all do not have a reservation declared one 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.150
 from none I think that a point of 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.830
 inflection is the musical career of 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.990
 rain is a subject that is called adrián and 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 which is also the name of the title a 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.590
 disc and from that it's like the disc where 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.470
 we realized that we could take the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.410
 history and the environment where our 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.220
 region of magallanes for our music 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.220
 and so do the original 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.870
 we have an album called Antarctic that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.519
 in history the tactic that what 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.250
 we presented in 2007 in a 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.980
 concert in the gym of the goal base 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.950
 freight and a record that is undoubtedly very 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.389
 mechanical is the idea is a disk that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.049
 tells the story of acceleration 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.459
 now from magallanes that is a bit like 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.310
 the cantata santa maría 'de quique but 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.109
 on a local issue and as with a 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.540
 sense of dynamism let's say very 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.880
 distinct clear and not a folk singing the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.280
 league in an electronic cantata 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.040
 nothing but happy music what 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.320
 we want to do is a music that reflects 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.760
 people trying to be happy in this 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.760
 tone or beating the environment 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.919
 because this second 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.700
 the second one that gave very good
