00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.160 
do it all the way around try to make
them<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.670> same<00:02:10.820> size<00:02:10.880> but<00:02:11.570> they're<00:02:12.050> not

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
them the same size but they're not

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.880 
them the same size but they're not
that's<00:02:12.380> okay

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that's okay

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.780 
that's okay
okay<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.300> those<00:02:14.480> are<00:02:14.600> leaves<00:02:14.900> for<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> sunflower

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
okay so those are leaves for a sunflower

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.530 
okay so those are leaves for a sunflower
then<00:02:16.790> I'm<00:02:16.880> going<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.060> take<00:02:17.180> our<00:02:17.330> yellow

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
then I'm going to take our yellow

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.620 
then I'm going to take our yellow
buttercream<00:02:17.840> with<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> same<00:02:18.590> leaf<00:02:18.980> tip

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
buttercream with the same leaf tip

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.410 
buttercream with the same leaf tip
holding<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> same<00:02:21.080> way<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.180> just

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
holding it the same way and just

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.530 
holding it the same way and just
overlapping<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.290> our<00:02:24.890> green<00:02:25.360> make<00:02:26.360> these<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
overlapping on our green make these a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.390 
overlapping on our green make these a
little<00:02:26.870> bit<00:02:26.930> bigger<00:02:27.200> because<00:02:27.500> these<00:02:27.710> are<00:02:28.010> our

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
little bit bigger because these are our

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.780 
little bit bigger because these are our
petals<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.560> do<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.770> same<00:02:30.980> thing<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.520> go<00:02:31.640> all

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
petals and do the same thing just go all

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.110 
petals and do the same thing just go all
the<00:02:31.820> way<00:02:31.910> around<00:02:33.040> I'm<00:02:34.040> letting<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.610> hand<00:02:34.910> do

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the way around I'm letting this hand do

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.800 
the way around I'm letting this hand do
all<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.360> work<00:02:35.570> by<00:02:36.140> turning<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.750> just

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
all the work by turning it and this just

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.190 
all the work by turning it and this just
stays<00:02:39.170> still<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.920> applies<00:02:40.460> pressure<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
stays still and applies pressure so

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.430 
stays still and applies pressure so
that's<00:02:42.350> one<00:02:42.560> layer<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.220> do<00:02:43.310> two<00:02:43.490> layers

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
that's one layer I like to do two layers

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.470 
that's one layer I like to do two layers
so<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> same<00:02:45.920> exact<00:02:46.250> thing<00:02:46.340> all<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.390> way

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so do the same exact thing all the way

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.160 
so do the same exact thing all the way
around<00:02:48.250> overlapping<00:02:49.250> our<00:02:49.820> last<00:02:50.030> layer<00:02:50.300> there

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
around overlapping our last layer there

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.630 
around overlapping our last layer there
we<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.380> our<00:02:51.410> sunflower<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.490> do<00:02:52.610> a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
we have our sunflower I like to do a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.100 
we have our sunflower I like to do a
bunch<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.970> these<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.450> put<00:02:53.660> them<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:53.930> together

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
bunch of these and put them all together

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.630 
bunch of these and put them all together
and<00:02:54.350> give<00:02:54.620> them<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.830> my<00:02:54.950> mom<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.459> looks<00:02:55.580> like

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and give them to my mom so it looks like

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.520 
and give them to my mom so it looks like
a<00:02:55.760> nice<00:02:55.970> bouquet<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.360> flowers<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.050> who

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.260 
a nice bouquet of flowers and who
doesn't<00:02:57.830> like<00:02:57.950> an<00:02:58.250> edible<00:02:58.790> bouquet<00:02:59.120> of

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
doesn't like an edible bouquet of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.900 
doesn't like an edible bouquet of
flowers<00:02:59.690> so<00:02:59.959> that's<00:03:00.920> how<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.130> make<00:03:01.190> easy

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
flowers so that's how you make easy

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.959 
flowers so that's how you make easy
