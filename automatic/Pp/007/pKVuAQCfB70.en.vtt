00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:02.540
 in times of crisis 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.700
 entrepreneurship as true networks 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.439
 the only option to be able to get ahead 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.210
 creativity the effort and investment that it requires 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 each 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.720
 products and innovations percent to March 9 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.950
 I lived interested to know through this fair a business initiative 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.189
 that has been more than nine years north 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.289
 and that today constitutes one of the elections 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.509
 Caring for the environment 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 the day mitigate the crisis more than interesting 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.440
 are your questions that without you 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 is a Valencian company that has developed in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.930
 the practical and economical players 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.639
 which constitutes a forum etc 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.169
 a viable solution for space problems optimizing and caring for 

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:51.590
 environment 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.720
 it is a water-soluble film or clint 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.050
 and the formulation of products compatible with the patented method 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.400
 allows the packaging of liquid products with solvent accused of 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.829
 multiple applications 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.140
 among which stand out the packaging of detergents and disinfectants in unidosis 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.000
 Agrochemical packaging 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.310
 including solvent derivatives 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.690
 If the powder and granular formulas dry 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.400
 a beautiful we were in principle has to start looking for products that 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 They were compatible with a plastic 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.760
 Whatever happens with the links obviously made it clear that the water runs through 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 plastic 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 we could not have water the products that we had that will have to pass 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870
 this kind of things 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.620
 there are other products that tic plasticizer or like when it would dissolve 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.210
 later in the water they are not raised 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.469
 in three points of the first module first time we had to compatibiliza porro 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.580
 It adapts little by demanding market 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.990
 Ada readapta by the formula for their part were compatible with other 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.570
 later the next phase can buy machines that were able to 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.640
 work with this classic since it did not exist in the market 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.830
 we had to design this appointment 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.590
 and in the third place what we had to do was that the process is also 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.950
 reliable outside economical mexico 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.459
 today we have to get the products that came out to look like 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.870
 prices compatible with the prices with groups that already exist 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.909
 that was a long or expensive process and at the same time we had to 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.239
 patentar roberto finds another tiny one hundred 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.560
 the field of applications of raw materials and finished products of 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.719
 chicxulub lic is very broad 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.769
 personal cinema companies 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.759
 interesting efficiency 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.349
 cleaning and disinfection companies 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.969
 raw Materials 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.709
 products myths sanitary photographic chemistry 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.779
 chemistry with water treatment among others 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.469
 the water soluble fic 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.590
 It is an ecological product and therefore a purchase argument for the user every 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.589
 become more aware of the importance of conserving the environment 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.149
 the product does not include any type of product in its formulation 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.290
 pollutant 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.499
 it is totally degraded 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.339
 we percent were convinced that we had to do 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.160
 Ecological treatments and respectful with the environment 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.450
 not only we are convinced everyone else we decided on 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.659
 bet on it 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.559
 and invest in something that could solve problems 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.489
 the water-soluble plastic that has existed for a long time only 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.229
 I applied the street 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.769
 we decided to start out cleaning costs both at the level 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.799
 domestic monica industries 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.469
 the second step towards phytosanitary products 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.469
 simple and all this despite being especially polluting with the environment 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.129
 ambient 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.599
 thus the clear objective of the suffrages 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.499
 in front of other environments successes eight poles that suppose manipulation 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:39.470
 ferrandis 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.429
 open bottles there 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.260
 the water-soluble train 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.170
 allows a correct clean and almost dosage of the product 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.029
 this company offers the following services 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:54.919
 in the vicinity 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.479
 formulation 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.419
 own brands 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.589
 If we are not together, we have the producer 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.099
 all all all that each sector these hectares human 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.539
 political detergents before they carried delicate items chargers 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.989
 denim clothes 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.549
 detergents with active in the evening 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.150
 we have dishwasher we have nigeria about the terms in which this one 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.029
 dictate the flocks 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.150
 even ose 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.729
 of assets for septic tanks 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.349
 and I'm sure that I leave some sections a wide range of products for 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.210
 domestic cleaning viatri 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.690
 the next step that has had an investigation aimed at passing 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.029
 insecticides 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.719
 are apple products the containers of polluting contributors i really 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.090
 that we do not want to run either 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.780
 your want to see 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.090
 end important topic 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.729
 that the market is capable 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.949
 to understand the new concept although it assimilates it and from there what 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.560
 we will apply to other sectors those that we are working 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.779
 but we are not going 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.770
 to superimpose the cellulosas race
