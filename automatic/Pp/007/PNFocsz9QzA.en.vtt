church in my thing and I just thought

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.010 
church in my thing and I just thought
that<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.830> looks<00:03:25.270> kind<00:03:26.270> of<00:03:26.330> cool<00:03:26.510> with<00:03:26.570> my

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
that it looks kind of cool with my

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.380 
that it looks kind of cool with my
church<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.770> there<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.640> did<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
church in there and I did it with the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.170 
church in there and I did it with the
windows<00:03:29.780> popping<00:03:30.260> out<00:03:30.440> abstract<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:32.150> know

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
windows popping out abstract you know

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.980 
windows popping out abstract you know
and<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.790> can<00:03:35.000> still<00:03:35.330> see<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.690> Word<00:03:35.900> of

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
and and you can still see the Word of

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.440 
and and you can still see the Word of
God<00:03:36.050> layered<00:03:36.590> underneath<00:03:37.190> everything<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.300> so

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
God layered underneath everything and so

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.540 
God layered underneath everything and so
that's<00:03:38.690> why<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.960> did<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:40.040> the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550
