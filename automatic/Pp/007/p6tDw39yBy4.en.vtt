00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Speak up, people, talk and be well. 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.080
 come a month to video in today's video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.450
 bring it to you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 the river because of the good data of the weak 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.230
 a video that I had promised a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.570
 It's time for another week, I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 I was a little late sorry but the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 people are here and then I will show 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.359
 better for you, how is ours? 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.449
 lady whom I already say I loved 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.670
 and I 'm going to read with you guys are going to show 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.580
 I'll play volleyball with you, then it's easy. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.920
 Demonstration on another champion on the enemy 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.390
 and I'm going to pass slowly to us 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 can understand everything right 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.180
 ended up starting with the passive 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.730
 is called salvation and she makes or receives 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.829
 70% speed of movement when 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.649
 She's running for an allied champion. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 that is less than 40% of life then 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.340
 You get faster to get the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 looked faster goals and achieve 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.530
 cure it and it's a little set that has 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.320
 which is 2,500 units away 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.350
 of the weak but what the so-called 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.359
 star was one that changed and more 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.180
 she does it back now a star 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.670
 in the target location so you mark the target and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 plays with the arrows 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.860
 randomly is now one and you? 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.220
 mark there and the enemies that are in the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.680
 radius of explosion in the larger circle 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.170
 receive 110 in the magician plus what you 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.900
 you have and the enemies that are right in the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 tava this center circle gets smaller 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.290
 150 percent damage and suffers 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.000
 35% slowness for two seconds 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.710
 Do not worry, I 'll show you around 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.759
 little to you, how is it but I think 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 that was really cool 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.630
 The goal to skill wqs astral fusion has a 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 that is for each champion that you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 achieves with yours that you receive a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.280
 little life of the type most insisted 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.790
 so one of the quotation marks is because the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.700
 your now can not but there herself 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.369
 so that was the big change and from w 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 You can not go there any more and this 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.259
 passive and active it is normal for you to go there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.530
 your normal teammate but the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.069
 great change was the same good passive 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.409
 now the skill is 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.840
 and that we and she now creates an area 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.480
 in the location you choose for a 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.849
 second and a half and deals 110 damage 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.060
 of the enemy champions who are 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.730
 within this freezing radius and also 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.829
 is he silence the champions that stay there 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.069
 they stay in the alice until they 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:32.769
 get out and if it's the enemy champions 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.090
 are still in this area when it 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.139
 fades away 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.510
 they will become nera types if they stay 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.939
 rooted for 25 seconds and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.879
 receives a damage but also then this 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:49.030
 there was a big change chicken and now 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:53.439
 then we have the ultimate rq is the desire 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.469
 that has not changed is the same you active and she 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:03:00.040
 heals all his allies by removing 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:02.620
 all these deferred and the power desires 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.599
 increase of 50% for each champion with 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.209
 less than 40% of life 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.189
 So this has not changed much. 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.259
 same thing and now'll show 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:17.290
 You 're the one in the enemy because the 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:19.569
 wwf show ea and also does not do much 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.000
 difference and show you how 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.319
 hit the enemy champion for you 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.319
 can see the change well 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.040
 the staff is now showing 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:34.569
 the enemy champion changes neither from here 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.790
 hence why aaw has no way to show 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.069
 I got there myself and if I did not 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.659
 make a difference is a normal game and the r 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.290
 also the ultimate does not have much that 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.689
 Show 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.180
 but you can see when the hit 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.479
 what was the enemy that comes a little light 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.840
 For me, that's right, that passive kemi ri 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:55.930
 there and then you can see the alice well 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.969
 these neraÃ­ that gives the champion started 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.439
 So I thought the Swedish was very 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.790
 good 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.459
 the changes that make her get more 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.079
 feasible and have one more major threat in 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.510
 law did that thing she did not have 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.519
 and even after that if you make a 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.519
 lady who bears at least one 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.230
 chalice he item Appel thing there is-of the 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.329
 down the street or in master ii 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.239
 she'll be a little scarier 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.979
 tell us so I found it very legal to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.930
 lady, what I needed at that time. 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.590
 the fifth time that poor day is good 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.180

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.849
