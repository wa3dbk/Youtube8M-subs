00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.980
 I hope it 's better and we're in a 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.980
 new series if a new 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.550
 how good as you as I am 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.100
 making a shovel adventures a map will 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.110
 He is afraid that he will say and good to continue 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.920
 pass had to learn many things 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.980
 of the commands so I hope that they 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.410
 like it's going to be his and I'm going to 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.940
 teach and leave the command in the 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.330
 description in case you want to do it in your 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.330
 world 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.320
 the first one I did is this is a zombie 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.180
 that in characteristic sign language 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.530
 has how you can see your helmet and comfortable 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.530
 what is the zombie astronaut 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 as you can see ok it's very fast already 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.280
 I tell you that is very fast this zombie is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.030
 very fast has a kept our 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 accomplished steel equipment and a pretty 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 plays that has fire so if you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 they stick with the fire careful because that is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.759
 to me is not that planet so do 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.300
 you'll be burning a good time so 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.390
 well let's teach it 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.590
 because as you can see it is very fast and the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.480
 moment that the matemos is going to give us 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 the blade wand that looks 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.990
 fire 2 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.750
 and how can you see why are we going to see if 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.479
 we advance a little bit is very very fast and 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.300
 as it is not high is a zombie is not the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.729
 planet so it is more advanced than 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.850
 us as you can see it is faster and 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.590
 us from a range of 50 blocks 50 blocks 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.399
 you can see them 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.399
 as you can see 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:56.490
 and it's pretty well accomplished 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 the astronaut and now we are the command 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.159
 it's a giant command of what you say and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.500
 do not be afraid to also say that if you 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.210
 we stick with one aspect and it's not going to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.780
 burn because it has good has 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.540
 resistance to fire since it is a good 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.730
 Your equipment makes it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.760
 invulnerable so good here we have 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.760
 the command that is a zombie 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.959
 as it is a zombie and here we have the drop 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 pose your armor 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.650
 here we have all the drops on 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.650
 equipment that is is the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.840
 in the front 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.150
 and basically all the new equipment 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.790
 you could not tell me that stuff because 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.660
 I took a lot of what here after 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.550
 here is the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.710
 however in the position that is hard 1 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.580
 and duration is infinite that's why it has 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.770
 so many nines and has no particles ok 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.420
 here we have that has 10 hearts is 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.770
 easy to sue until that is easy to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.010
 kill 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.010
 folk or a range of 50 to 50 blocks 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.250
 you can see us in good here is the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.250
 result 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.620
 and well I'm doing the index of this 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.080

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.960
