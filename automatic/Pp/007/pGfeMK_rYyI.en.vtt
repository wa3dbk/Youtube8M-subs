00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.560
 and the truth that everything started 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.930
 how could it be otherwise not with 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.349
 our love of motorcycles myself 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.700
 particularly he is known for mere hobby 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.310
 the engineers of the university carlos 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.539
 third specializing in end project 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.760
 of career in the manufacture of a 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.369
 motorcycle and the truth that they spent years 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.250
 no contact with them but one Saturday 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.100
 in the morning I received a call from jose 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.470
 of josé germán telling me that they believed that 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.140
 they had a series of very solutions 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.079
 advanced for the manufacture of a 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.339
 100% electric motorcycle souvenir 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.350
 that at that time he said he is already 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.749
 there doing something says no code because 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.579
 neiro home and tell me I had a good 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.829
 friend with whom he shared the project 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.850
 that was the poem CEO of 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.199
 magna steyr in graz in austria and you 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.440
 I called and told him hey look there's a 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.579
 electric technology project I think 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.670
 which is very interesting 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.190
 and I would like it if we form a team 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.009
 to take this project to the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.750
 actually being part of it is not me 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.030
 He said that if the company immediately 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.580
 we always think that maybe because of the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.289
 different ancestry of each one that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.950
 many makes this type of projects we 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.899
 lead to not reaching a good end because 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.530
 the engineering aspect prevails and 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.350
 then it grows not so 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.820
 unbalanced and we always think of 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.690
 carry a project in which in which 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.490
 grow the engineering part and 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.470
 technological but that at the same time that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.170
 the company said as support 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.790
 business to the project we think that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.810
 that was fundamental at 67 months of 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.030
 start working from the point of 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.649
 technological view we sign up to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.450
 run the motorcycle world championship 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.240
 electrical the first of them and in 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 we made third parties and the truth is that 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.800
 that encouraged us to realize that the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.009
 solutions that we are developing 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.250
 they were competitive solutions think about 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.860
 bultaco at the beginning I remember that supposed 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.100
 the first time that possibility came out 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.679
 it seemed like a dream 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.620
 but right away from the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.290
 principle we thought it was a solution 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.880
 possible and then involved negotiating with the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.690
 family bulk 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.360
 what it seems very difficult the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.080
 true that it was very easy from the first 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.350
 day the level of understanding in the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.660
 involvement I shared some 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.260
 feelings and sensations about 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.860
 about the motorcycle the reality is that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.170
 that was very very common between the two 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.730
 equipment from the first moment what 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.310
 facilitated I think 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.310
 the fact of why also the family 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.760
 I had never done it 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.270
 I trust this team so that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.120
 bultaco motorcycles become a 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.860
 not really if it's on the street I think 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.459
 that something important and important also 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.200
 today that we launched on the new motorcycle 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.019
 is that the values ​​that we 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.660
 We handle when manufacturing a 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.080
 motorcycle are the same as I had 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.730
 bultaco in its origins the passion the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.060
 innovation technology 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.860
 today from the perspective that the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.860
 first launch in a project of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.180
 100% electric motorcycle however the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.519
 values ​​that accompany us for that are 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.190
 the same ones that motorcycle has to be 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.410
 a fun bike with features 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.900
 sensations with the same values ​​that 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.150
 represented bultaco at the time all 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.730
 bultaco's motorcycle had in the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.819
 Don Paco's soul for him the competition 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.680
 it was something basic and the competition also 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.560
 with himself it shows in his products 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.980
 they always worked on moving forward 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.319
 the products that they had 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.510
 in making motorcycles that were or 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.430
 will stand out for some of its aspects 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.340
 in the in the international market and I 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.730
 I think that is a commitment and that enthusiasm 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.060
 so what does it have today? 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.060
 brand
