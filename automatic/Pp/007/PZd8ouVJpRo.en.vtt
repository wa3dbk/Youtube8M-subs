00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
different raw editing programs for linux

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.160 
different raw editing programs for linux
and<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.700> right<00:00:08.849> now<00:00:08.880> i'm<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.480> show<00:00:09.660> dark

and so right now i'm going to show dark
room<00:00:10.639> obviously<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:12.450> play<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:14.059> lightroom<00:00:15.059> we'll

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
room obviously a play on lightroom we'll

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.760 
room obviously a play on lightroom we'll
see<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.680> compares<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> i'll<00:00:19.140> go<00:00:19.289> ahead<00:00:19.320> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
see if it compares so i'll go ahead and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.290 
see if it compares so i'll go ahead and
go<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.160> open<00:00:20.820> directory<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.760> select<00:00:23.760> I've<00:00:24.029> got

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
go to open directory and select I've got

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.790 
go to open directory and select I've got
a<00:00:24.330> directory<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> bunch<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> raw<00:00:26.279> files

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
a directory with a bunch of raw files

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.049 
a directory with a bunch of raw files
and<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.640> i<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:30.500> go<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> i<00:00:32.369> press<00:00:32.640> ok

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and so i will go to it and i press ok

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.889 
and so i will go to it and i press ok
and<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:34.440> does<00:00:35.540> nothing<00:00:36.890> yeah<00:00:37.890> i<00:00:38.510> don't<00:00:39.510> know

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and it does nothing yeah i don't know

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.170 
and it does nothing yeah i don't know
what<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.200> supposed<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.890> i<00:00:41.129> would<00:00:41.969> think

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
what it's supposed to do i would think

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440 
what it's supposed to do i would think
it<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.570> maybe<00:00:43.379> show<00:00:43.739> thumbnails<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
it would maybe show thumbnails but it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.560 
it would maybe show thumbnails but it
does<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.600> too<00:00:49.289> impressed<00:00:49.469> with

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
does not that I'm not too impressed with

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.779 
does not that I'm not too impressed with

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
which files I've got i'll just pick one

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
which files I've got i'll just pick one
on<00:00:56.250> random<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:59.329> alright<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
on random and see what we get alright so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.369 
on random and see what we get alright so
we've<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> picture<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.210> it's<00:01:03.210> zoomed<00:01:04.110> in

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
we've got a picture here it's zoomed in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
we've got a picture here it's zoomed in
quite<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> bit<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.220> we'll<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.519> ahead<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> zoom

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
quite a bit so we'll go ahead and zoom

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.719 
quite a bit so we'll go ahead and zoom
out<00:01:06.650> all<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.580> we've<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:10.729> let's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
out all right now we've got this let's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.620 
out all right now we've got this let's
start<00:01:11.909> editing<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.770> white<00:01:14.040> balance<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.880> go

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
start editing so white balance will go

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.399 
start editing so white balance will go
to<00:01:16.640> automatic<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.680> voila<00:01:20.210> changes<00:01:21.210> note<00:01:21.509> does

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
to automatic and voila changes note does

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.990 
to automatic and voila changes note does
not<00:01:22.650> change<00:01:23.299> will<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> custom<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:26.000> maybe

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
not change will go to custom and maybe

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.569 
not change will go to custom and maybe
try<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> change<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:30.979> yes<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.340> does

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
try to change that and yes it does

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
try to change that and yes it does
change<00:01:33.110> takes<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.259> while<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:36.259> definitely

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
change takes a while but as definitely

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.219 
change takes a while but as definitely
one<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.740> I've<00:01:38.460> noticed<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.930> dark<00:01:40.680> room<00:01:40.920> is

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
one thing I've noticed with dark room is

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.010 
one thing I've noticed with dark room is
to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.409> any<00:01:43.710> change<00:01:44.130> takes<00:01:44.640> quite<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to make any change takes quite a bit of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.359 
to make any change takes quite a bit of
time<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.299> patient<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
time and you can have to be patient and

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.770 
time and you can have to be patient and
I<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> go<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:52.049> where<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> was

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
I really want to go back to where I was

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.350 
I really want to go back to where I was
that<00:01:54.780> looks<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.579> difficult<00:01:56.579> than<00:01:57.030> I'd<00:01:57.329> care

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that looks more difficult than I'd care

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.609 
that looks more difficult than I'd care
to<00:01:58.159> endeavor<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.520> we're<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.969> move<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
to endeavor so we're going to move on to

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.170 
to endeavor so we're going to move on to
light<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.790> i'll<00:02:03.000> bump<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> exposure<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
light and i'll bump up the exposure and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.919 
light and i'll bump up the exposure and
wait<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.960> wait<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.369> go

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
wait and wait and there we go

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.920 
wait and wait and there we go
looking<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.560> bit<00:02:10.590> better<00:02:10.799> but<00:02:11.430> again<00:02:11.930> it's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
looking a bit better but again it's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.530 
looking a bit better but again it's
taking<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.620> long<00:02:13.920> time<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.829> you<00:02:17.549> can<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.969> a<00:02:18.000> few

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
taking a long time and you can do a few

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
taking a long time and you can do a few
things<00:02:18.599> with<00:02:18.989> color<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.120> got<00:02:21.299> some<00:02:23.030> file

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
things with color then you got some file

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.339 
things with color then you got some file
format<00:02:24.569> options<00:02:25.140> how<00:02:25.859> big<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.280> want<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.579> file

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
format options how big you want the file

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.649 
format options how big you want the file
and<00:02:28.349> we've<00:02:28.799> got<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> curve<00:02:29.459> here<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.090> lightness

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
and we've got a curve here for lightness

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.410 
and we've got a curve here for lightness
so<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.799> go<00:02:31.980> ahead<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.250> edit<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
so you can go ahead and edit that and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.699 
so you can go ahead and edit that and
then<00:02:33.780> wait<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> change<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.519> does

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
then wait for it to change and it does

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.470 
then wait for it to change and it does
really<00:02:38.569> as<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:40.349> is<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:40.920> now<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.519> am<00:02:41.639> not<00:02:42.209> at

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
really as it is right now I am not at

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.679 
really as it is right now I am not at
all<00:02:42.810> impressed<00:02:42.989> with<00:02:43.470> dark<00:02:43.769> room<00:02:44.359> it<00:02:45.359> takes

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
all impressed with dark room it takes

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.699 
all impressed with dark room it takes
too<00:02:46.139> long<00:02:46.169> to<00:02:46.439> see<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> changes<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.000> make

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
too long to see the changes you make

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.789 
too long to see the changes you make
doesn't<00:02:49.709> offer<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.549> options<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.650> lot<00:02:52.650> of

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
doesn't offer a lot of options a lot of
