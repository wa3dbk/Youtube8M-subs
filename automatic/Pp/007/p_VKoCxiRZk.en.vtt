finally managed to get everything ready

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.230 
finally managed to get everything ready
for<00:00:08.670> my<00:00:09.480> player<00:00:09.870> owned<00:00:10.349> ports<00:00:11.010> armors<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
for my player owned ports armors and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.079 
for my player owned ports armors and
funny<00:00:13.230> enough<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:14.099> around<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> corner<00:00:14.880> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
version to sell them for profit I did

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.209 
version to sell them for profit I did
work<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.659> know

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
work out that would be like I know

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
work out that would be like I know
twenty<00:01:59.219> voyages<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.829> voyages<00:02:01.829> voyages<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.320> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
twenty voyages of voyages voyages of the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.160 
twenty voyages of voyages voyages of the
cheap<00:02:05.250> late<00:02:05.579> or<00:02:05.880> lacquer<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> was<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
cheap late or lacquer so I was kind of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.419 
cheap late or lacquer so I was kind of
thinking<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.860> worth<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
thinking you know is it worth it to

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
thinking you know is it worth it to
native<00:02:08.910> web<00:02:09.060> or<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.420> house<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:09.840> does<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.050> get

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
native web or this house or does it get

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.630 
native web or this house or does it get
maybe<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.250> 10<00:02:11.459> million

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
maybe like 10 million

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.940 
maybe like 10 million
I<00:02:12.670> think<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.180> some<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.660> Helms<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.350> I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
I think like some of the Helms and I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.030 
I think like some of the Helms and I
think<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.760> Tetsu<00:02:16.120> hams<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.540> 1.5<00:02:17.350> million<00:02:17.830> or

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
think the Tetsu hams like 1.5 million or

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.220 
think the Tetsu hams like 1.5 million or
not<00:02:18.190> even<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.300> maybe<00:02:19.540> it's<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:19.750> worth<00:02:20.050> it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
not even that so maybe it's not worth it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.050 
not even that so maybe it's not worth it
might<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.620> give<00:02:20.770> up<00:02:20.920> after<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:22.000> I'm

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
might just give up after this but I'm

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.260 
might just give up after this but I'm
still<00:02:22.360> just<00:02:22.540> super<00:02:22.990> nervous<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.970> I've<00:02:25.060> got<00:02:25.240> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
still just super nervous so I've got the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.440 
still just super nervous so I've got the
sea<00:02:25.900> singers<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.590> Tetsu<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.790> final<00:02:28.240> one

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
sea singers and the Tetsu the final one

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.290 
sea singers and the Tetsu the final one

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
minutes ago so I just don't get it wrong

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.050 
minutes ago so I just don't get it wrong
lacquer<00:02:44.680> has<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.190> some<00:02:45.340> reason<00:02:45.640> taken<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
lacquer has for some reason taken the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.350 
lacquer has for some reason taken the
longest<00:02:46.540> I've<00:02:47.290> got<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:47.650> 40<00:02:48.250> Chi<00:02:48.640> more<00:02:49.120> than

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
lacquer so that's kind of a bit weird

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.130

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
it's great money but because I'm quite

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.020 
it's great money but because I'm quite
rich<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.550> find<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:12.910> much

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
rich as it is I just find it so much

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.640 
rich as it is I just find it so much
easier<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.810> stand<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.380> grand

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
easier just to stand in the grand

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.130 
easier just to stand in the grand
exchange<00:03:14.910> making<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:16.000> bit<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.239> money<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.690> just

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.660 
exchange making a bit of money I just
don't<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.470> do<00:03:17.590> my<00:03:17.769> heart<00:03:18.070> or<00:03:18.400> get<00:03:18.549> my

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
hands dirty so i think i might start

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.759 
hands dirty so i think i might start
doing<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.060> though<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.959> had<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:23.470> many<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
you request to get better armor because

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.009
