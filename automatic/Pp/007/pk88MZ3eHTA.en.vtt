00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.949
 good afternoon friends my name is nina we 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:05.270
 talk later how to protect yourself in the winter year 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.560
 falling injured on slippery 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.709
 winter road 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.759
 basement from inaccessible or winter 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.639
 codes that are on the back 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.820
 keep responding reduce risk of falling 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.310
 and today we will but inspect 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.700
 telling by model i'm trucks walker 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.759
 percent 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.949
 useful and necessary goods 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.579
 such a model 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.499
 winter codes are very interesting beautiful 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.720
 Poroshenko min 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.070
 I briefly walker intended for 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.370
 to 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.380
 non-slip inscription 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.640
 no coating on the coating 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.450
 of course they do not exclude a hundred 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.060
 percent drop some 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.819
 unpleasant adventures on 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.809
 during the winter season but they reduce 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.229
 Misha as others find reduces the risk 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.290
 fall injury 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.470
 what they are 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.190
 This rubber such what katya crisis 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.420
 which is enough saw partially analysis 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.600
 on a high-rise bridge 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.970
 and it should sit tight on the sole 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.660
 so the paintwork are the same 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.700
 not 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.690
 we will wear head year 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.140
 and risks of frost are persistent in principle and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.100
 Anya is calculated to minus forty degrees 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.510
 using 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.770
 such weather conditions 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.570
 but the bottom line is that we are just 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.580
 protects this system such as 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.150
 what's the check 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.850
 there are a lot of them 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.060
 here are the ones like glasses 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 the rest of 101 they estimate enough 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.210
 resilient here from pinning 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 protected against corrosion 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 and hi 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 cuddling shoes 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800
 colleagues new snow cover 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.490
 they will be actively crashing over 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.470
 most discouraging slip and forward and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.870
 back and side 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.070
 that is, in this case with 10 not at the expense of 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.560
 metal spikes 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.910
 the rest and due to become resistant to 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.590
 work 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.510
 coils 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.050
 but in principle they can be used 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.390
 or men and women and children 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.790
 Well, most likely this model 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.600
 imply all the same shoes on flat 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.440
 the sole because it just will 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.579
 positioned above the sole 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.169
 and shoes that is whether for the heel the tenth place 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.099
 the list will not remain even pick 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.849
 other mobility finds are also there 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.379
 but now let's see how it is 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.949
 will be 3 5 recall 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.789
 how will they sit 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.789
 we take on kinah 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.979
 we surely fix us with whom 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.549
 and further 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 on all and sole 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.279
 that's the way we are now these 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.109
 seregin shoes on six are on 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.809
 places well they sit canvases coil 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.939
 we are here just what came up cover 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.979
 you choose the size of the loan course plywood 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.939
 different sizes to your size will be 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.799
 work out these attention that is they 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.749
 not dimensionless 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.069
 what we got 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.249
 be sure to follow 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.799
 caution even if you use 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.099
 winter raised because they like me already 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.969
 said owen lower korean pascal 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.449
 tasks but do not exclude everyone 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.839
 surprises trouble 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.339
 slippery road 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.969
 sailors what more can you say no 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.549
 use on hard surfaces 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.869
 besides snow and ice 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.609
 still spoils for example on asphalt 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.039
 Do not use indoors because 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.249
 floor cover may be damaged after 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.229
 use wipe cloth 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.839
 washed to dry and denmark from solar 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:29.570
 rays 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.440
 but this is the basic requirements 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.730
 here are such here apparently move everton ceremonial 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.449
 like many other models you can 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.600

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.220
