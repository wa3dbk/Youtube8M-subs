00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
I want to be talking about the controls

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.010 
I want to be talking about the controls
and<00:00:29.860> everything<00:00:30.250> like<00:00:30.369> that<00:00:30.520> in<00:00:31.000> f1<00:00:31.450> 2012

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
and everything like that in f1 2012

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.210 
and everything like that in f1 2012
because<00:00:32.290> they<00:00:32.739> said<00:00:32.950> that<00:00:32.980> they've<00:00:33.190> been

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
because they said that they've been

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.190 
because they said that they've been
looking<00:00:33.610> at<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.880> pad<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.150> lot<00:00:34.630> more<00:00:34.870> for<00:00:35.110> this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
looking at the pad a lot more for this

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.960 
looking at the pad a lot more for this
game<00:00:35.440> they've<00:00:35.920> moved<00:00:36.160> away<00:00:36.370> from<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.790> wheel<00:00:36.940> I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
game they've moved away from the wheel I

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.729 
game they've moved away from the wheel I
guess<00:00:37.270> a<00:00:37.300> little<00:00:37.570> bit<00:00:37.840> well<00:00:38.230> as<00:00:38.350> keeping<00:00:38.620> the

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
guess a little bit well as keeping the

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.690 
guess a little bit well as keeping the
wheel<00:00:38.890> same<00:00:39.190> because<00:00:39.399> a<00:00:39.460> lot<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.640> people

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
wheel same because a lot of people

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.270 
wheel same because a lot of people
that's<00:00:40.060> all<00:00:40.210> I<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:41.590> say<00:00:41.620> everybody's<00:00:42.100> happy

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
that's all I would say everybody's happy

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.689 
that's all I would say everybody's happy
with<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.670> wheel<00:00:42.879> in<00:00:43.359> f1<00:00:43.870> 2011<00:00:44.769> but<00:00:44.980> it's<00:00:45.489> got<00:00:45.670> a

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
with the wheel in f1 2011 but it's got a

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:46.950 
with the wheel in f1 2011 but it's got a
little<00:00:45.789> bit<00:00:46.000> of<00:00:46.030> input<00:00:46.180> lag<00:00:46.480> but<00:00:46.660> I<00:00:46.719> think

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
little bit of input lag but I think

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.560 
little bit of input lag but I think
people<00:00:47.109> all<00:00:47.469> right<00:00:47.710> with<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:49.239> f<00:00:49.359> 13

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
people all right with it and then f 13

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.869 
people all right with it and then f 13
12<00:00:49.989> they're<00:00:50.469> focusing<00:00:50.859> a<00:00:50.980> lot<00:00:51.160> on<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.640> pad

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
12 they're focusing a lot on the pad

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.069 
12 they're focusing a lot on the pad
which<00:00:52.090> means<00:00:52.329> it'll<00:00:52.510> be<00:00:52.600> more<00:00:52.840> progressive

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
which means it'll be more progressive

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.529 
which means it'll be more progressive
and<00:00:53.649> will<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.399> little<00:00:54.640> bit<00:00:54.789> more<00:00:54.940> responsive

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
and will be a little bit more responsive

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.660 
and will be a little bit more responsive
and<00:00:55.690> it's<00:00:56.320> going<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.649> be<00:00:56.739> like<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.519> can

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
and it's going to be like you can

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.069 
and it's going to be like you can
actually<00:00:57.789> race<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.390> lot<00:00:58.539> better<00:00:58.690> with<00:00:58.960> it

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
actually race it a lot better with it

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.319 
actually race it a lot better with it
because<00:00:59.199> used<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.920> be<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.219> will<00:01:00.429> you<00:01:00.460> used<00:01:01.210> to

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
because used to be the will you used to

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.450 
because used to be the will you used to
be<00:01:01.390> able<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.660> put<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.899> lot<00:01:02.260> more<00:01:02.289> precision<00:01:02.769> when

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
be able to put a lot more precision when

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.650 
be able to put a lot more precision when
you're<00:01:03.609> driving<00:01:03.789> around<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.210> car<00:01:04.390> because

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
you're driving around the car because

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.660 
you're driving around the car because
you<00:01:04.750> know<00:01:04.870> normally<00:01:05.500> on<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.650> sticks<00:01:05.920> like<00:01:06.160> one

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
you know normally on the sticks like one

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.790 
you know normally on the sticks like one
way<00:01:06.850> by<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.210> way<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.870> it's<00:01:08.050> like<00:01:08.200> violent

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
way by the way and it's like violent

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.860 
way by the way and it's like violent
attacks<00:01:09.370> on<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.610> steering<00:01:09.820> wheel<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.210> if<00:01:10.780> you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
attacks on the steering wheel and if you

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.180 
attacks on the steering wheel and if you
were<00:01:10.990> driving<00:01:11.200> with<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.470> steering<00:01:11.710> wheel<00:01:11.980> you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
were driving with the steering wheel you

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.190 
were driving with the steering wheel you
could<00:01:12.550> like<00:01:12.730> put<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.090> more<00:01:13.390> softly<00:01:13.810> into<00:01:14.080> the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
could like put that more softly into the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.540 
could like put that more softly into the
corner<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.650> maybe<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:14.950> get<00:01:15.070> better<00:01:15.280> lines

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
corner and maybe you get better lines

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.850 
corner and maybe you get better lines
but<00:01:16.270> they<00:01:16.630> say<00:01:16.810> they're<00:01:17.110> going<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.290> put<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.620> a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
but they say they're going to put in a

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.830 
but they say they're going to put in a
lot<00:01:18.010> more<00:01:18.070> time<00:01:18.460> into<00:01:19.000> actually<00:01:19.360> making<00:01:19.540> sure

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
lot more time into actually making sure

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.050 
lot more time into actually making sure
that<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> pad<00:01:20.680> has<00:01:20.980> a<00:01:21.010> fair<00:01:21.340> chance<00:01:21.370> against

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
that the pad has a fair chance against

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.210 
that the pad has a fair chance against
the<00:01:22.150> wheel<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:23.050> year's<00:01:23.320> game<00:01:23.590> which<00:01:24.010> i'm

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
the wheel in this year's game which i'm

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890 
the wheel in this year's game which i'm
looking<00:01:24.520> forward<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:24.910> because<00:01:25.300> there'll<00:01:25.720> be<00:01:25.750> a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
looking forward to because there'll be a

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.270 
looking forward to because there'll be a
good<00:01:26.110> thing<00:01:26.260> because<00:01:26.440> I'm<00:01:26.590> always<00:01:26.800> using<00:01:26.980> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
good thing because I'm always using the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.670 
good thing because I'm always using the
pad<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.730> Xbox<00:01:28.180> cuz<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.110> have<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.290> will<00:01:29.500> but

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
pad on the Xbox cuz I have a will but

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.340 
pad on the Xbox cuz I have a will but
it's<00:01:29.830> really<00:01:30.100> not<00:01:30.310> very<00:01:30.370> good<00:01:30.790> for<00:01:31.260> you<00:01:32.260> know

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
it's really not very good for you know

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.560 
it's really not very good for you know
f1<00:01:32.770> because<00:01:33.040> it's<00:01:33.160> got<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.400> input<00:01:33.640> lag<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.030> my

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
f1 because it's got the input lag and my

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.920
