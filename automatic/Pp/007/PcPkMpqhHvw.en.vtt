favorite questions to be asked is what's
new<00:00:41.470> with<00:00:41.620> sublimation<00:00:42.150> well<00:00:43.150> today<00:00:43.450> we<00:00:43.720> have

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
new with sublimation well today we have

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.010 
new with sublimation well today we have
a<00:00:43.960> big<00:00:44.500> what's<00:00:45.040> new<00:00:45.309> assimilation<00:00:46.120> today<00:00:46.780> I'm

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
a big what's new assimilation today I'm

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.920 
a big what's new assimilation today I'm
here<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.500> introduce<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:48.460> next<00:00:48.690> generation<00:00:49.690> of

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
here to introduce the next generation of

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.470 
here to introduce the next generation of
sublimation<00:00:50.530> printers<00:00:51.370> they<00:00:52.000> look<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.330> little

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
sublimation printers they look a little

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.450 
sublimation printers they look a little
bit<00:00:52.690> like<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.230> old<00:00:53.350> ones<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:53.860> that's<00:00:54.040> because

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
bit like the old ones and that's because

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.970 
bit like the old ones and that's because
they're<00:00:54.730> made<00:00:54.879> from<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.330> same<00:00:55.690> basic<00:00:56.500> printer

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
they're made from the same basic printer

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.850 
they're made from the same basic printer
as<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.280> old<00:00:57.460> ones<00:00:57.670> but<00:00:58.480> this<00:00:58.720> time<00:00:59.020> with

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
as the old ones but this time with

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.120 
as the old ones but this time with
several<00:01:00.610> very<00:01:01.060> important<00:01:01.870> changes<00:01:02.320> number

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
several very important changes number

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.280 
several very important changes number
one<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.790> believe<00:01:03.850> these<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:05.020> first

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
one is I believe these are the first

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.219 
one is I believe these are the first
printers<00:01:05.860> ever<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.150> desktop<00:01:07.509> as<00:01:07.900> far<00:01:08.140> as

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
printers ever for the desktop as far as

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.889 
printers ever for the desktop as far as
I<00:01:08.380> can<00:01:08.440> remember<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.820> are<00:01:10.000> designed<00:01:10.360> out<00:01:10.600> of

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
I can remember that are designed out of

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.020 
I can remember that are designed out of
the<00:01:11.020> box<00:01:11.259> for<00:01:11.590> sublimation<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.640> that's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
the box for sublimation and that's

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.210 
the box for sublimation and that's
because<00:01:13.570> our<00:01:13.869> friends<00:01:14.320> at<00:01:14.440> Sawgrass<00:01:14.649> the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
because our friends at Sawgrass the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.550 
because our friends at Sawgrass the
folks<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.759> make<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.149> ink<00:01:16.330> have<00:01:16.930> partnered

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
folks that make the ink have partnered

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.550 
folks that make the ink have partnered
with<00:01:17.800> Rico<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:19.630> our<00:01:19.780> feedback<00:01:20.110> with

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
with Rico and through our feedback with

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.499 
with Rico and through our feedback with
them<00:01:20.800> through<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.340> evolution<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.300> these

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
them through the evolution of these

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.930 
them through the evolution of these
printers<00:01:23.020> they've<00:01:23.740> gotten<00:01:24.130> with<00:01:24.280> Rico<00:01:24.700> and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
printers they've gotten with Rico and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.719 
printers they've gotten with Rico and
they<00:01:25.330> have<00:01:25.600> Ashe<00:01:25.899> Rico<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.560> make<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.220> printer

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
they have Ashe Rico to make this printer

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.539 
they have Ashe Rico to make this printer
for<00:01:28.450> Sawgrass<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.830> if<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.040> look<00:01:30.220> on<00:01:30.400> them

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
for Sawgrass so if you look on them

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.149 
for Sawgrass so if you look on them
you'll<00:01:31.090> see<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:31.630> they<00:01:31.840> bare<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.500> Sawgrass

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
you'll see that they bare the Sawgrass

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.850 
you'll see that they bare the Sawgrass
name<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.240> that's<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.140> good<00:01:35.260> thing<00:01:35.560> for<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
name and that's a good thing for a

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.490 
name and that's a good thing for a
couple<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.220> reasons<00:01:36.370> one<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.120> it<00:01:37.450> makes<00:01:38.170> our

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
couple of reasons one is it makes our

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.219 
couple of reasons one is it makes our
community<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.520> support<00:01:40.090> between<00:01:40.659> us<00:01:40.960> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
community of support between us and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.039 
community of support between us and
Sawgrass<00:01:41.710> tighter<00:01:42.190> no<00:01:42.909> longer<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:43.659> need<00:01:43.750> to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
Sawgrass tighter no longer do we need to

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.640 
Sawgrass tighter no longer do we need to
go<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.229> Rico<00:01:44.880> when<00:01:45.880> we're<00:01:46.030> having<00:01:46.180> problems

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
go to Rico when we're having problems

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.750 
go to Rico when we're having problems
mechanical<00:01:47.650> problems<00:01:48.010> or<00:01:48.130> whatever<00:01:48.430> with<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
mechanical problems or whatever with the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.090 
mechanical problems or whatever with the
printer<00:01:49.119> warranty<00:01:49.630> issues<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.890> really

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
printer warranty issues so it really

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.179 
printer warranty issues so it really
makes<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.670> great<00:01:51.940> family<00:01:52.690> relationship<00:01:53.650> to

help you be successful with these

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.880 
help you be successful with these
printers<00:01:56.700> number<00:01:57.700> two<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.119> when<00:01:58.840> sawgrass<00:01:59.350> got

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
printers number two is when sawgrass got

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.760 
printers number two is when sawgrass got
with<00:02:00.100> Rico<00:02:00.549> they<00:02:01.330> made<00:02:01.570> changes<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.439> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
with Rico they made changes to the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.429 
with Rico they made changes to the
printers<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.760> improve<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.930> print<00:02:05.200> quality

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
printers to improve the print quality

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.400 
printers to improve the print quality
sort<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.430> like<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:07.090> mid-year<00:02:07.570> model

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
sort of like a mid-year model

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.979 
sort of like a mid-year model
improvement<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> car<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:10.420> make<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.959> a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
improvement on a car to make it have a

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.500 
improvement on a car to make it have a
smoother<00:02:11.530> ride<00:02:11.709> update<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.610> technology<00:02:13.330> in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
smoother ride update the technology in

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.820 
smoother ride update the technology in
the<00:02:13.630> car<00:02:13.810> things<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.410> that

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the car things like that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.300 
the car things like that
next<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.170> Sawgrass<00:02:17.170> went<00:02:17.590> back<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
next is Sawgrass went back to the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.479 
next is Sawgrass went back to the
drawing<00:02:18.549> board<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.590> formulated<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.709> brand<00:02:21.160> new

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
drawing board and formulated a brand new

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.970 
drawing board and formulated a brand new
ink<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.720> ink<00:02:22.959> they<00:02:23.170> call<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.739> sub

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
ink and that ink they call the sub

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.840 
ink and that ink they call the sub
legette<00:02:24.570> HD<00:02:25.570> ink<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.650> HD<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.579> of<00:02:27.670> course

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
legette HD ink the HD and of course

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.880 
legette HD ink the HD and of course
that's<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.390> acronym<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.410> we're<00:02:29.769> familiar

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
that's a acronym that we're familiar

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.490 
that's a acronym that we're familiar
with<00:02:30.190> high<00:02:30.400> definition<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.049> new<00:02:32.260> ink

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
with high definition and so this new ink

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.820 
with high definition and so this new ink
is<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:33.480> expanded<00:02:34.480> color<00:02:34.750> gamut<00:02:35.080> ink<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.650> has

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
is a expanded color gamut ink it has

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
these printers and I'm very very

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.700 
these printers and I'm very very
impressed<00:02:52.670> with<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.840> incremental

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710

themselves

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.990 
themselves
I<00:02:57.530> mean<00:02:58.190> impressed<00:02:58.880> with<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.300> ink<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.520> so

there but we're trying so that the entry
level<00:04:38.300> cost<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:39.200> doing<00:04:39.620> some<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.040> these<00:04:40.160> large

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
level cost of doing some of these large

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.690 
level cost of doing some of these large
products<00:04:41.030> like<00:04:41.180> socks<00:04:41.479> are<00:04:41.780> achievable<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:43.370> so

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
products like socks are achievable so so

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.670 
products like socks are achievable so so
still<00:04:44.000> at<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.360> on<00:04:44.540> this<00:04:45.020> printer<00:04:45.410> same

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
still at it on this printer same

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.469 
still at it on this printer same
capabilities<00:04:46.400> out<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:46.789> box<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.300> does

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
capabilities out of the box it does

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.750 
capabilities out of the box it does
eleven<00:04:47.900> by<00:04:47.990> seventeen<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:49.400> add<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
eleven by seventeen if you add the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.700 
eleven by seventeen if you add the
bypass<00:04:50.270> tray

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
bypass tray

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.150 
bypass tray
it<00:04:51.889> does<00:04:52.129> 13<00:04:52.699> by<00:04:52.970> 21<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.470> course<00:04:54.680> we<00:04:54.979> have<00:04:55.129> a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
it does 13 by 21 and of course we have a

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.610 
it does 13 by 21 and of course we have a
bunch<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:55.819> paper<00:04:56.060> sizes<00:04:56.479> that<00:04:57.440> are

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
bunch of paper sizes that are

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.149 
bunch of paper sizes that are
appropriate<00:04:58.490> for<00:04:58.629> substrates<00:04:59.629> like<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.620> the

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
appropriate for substrates like the the

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.839 
appropriate for substrates like the the
device<00:05:01.909> cover<00:05:02.240> inserts<00:05:02.870> mug<00:05:03.500> papers<00:05:04.099> you<00:05:04.580> name

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
device cover inserts mug papers you name

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.969 
device cover inserts mug papers you name
it<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:05.210> what<00:05:05.900> we're<00:05:06.050> trying<00:05:06.229> to<00:05:06.530> do<00:05:06.680> is

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
it so what we're trying to do is

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.240 
it so what we're trying to do is
practice<00:05:07.849> what<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:08.330> call<00:05:08.629> Kaizen<00:05:09.229> which<00:05:09.860> simply

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
practice what I call Kaizen which simply

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.610 
practice what I call Kaizen which simply
means<00:05:10.280> we<00:05:10.729> make<00:05:10.940> small<00:05:11.300> incremental

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
means we make small incremental

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.869 
means we make small incremental
improvements<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.740> if<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:12.949> make<00:05:13.129> hundreds<00:05:13.699> or

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
improvements and if you make hundreds or

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.420 
improvements and if you make hundreds or
even<00:05:13.909> thousands<00:05:14.720> guess<00:05:15.379> what<00:05:15.650> you've<00:05:16.190> got<00:05:16.400> a

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
even thousands guess what you've got a

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.430 
even thousands guess what you've got a
great<00:05:16.729> value<00:05:17.180> what<00:05:17.810> I'd<00:05:17.870> like<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.139> to<00:05:18.199> do<00:05:18.409> now
