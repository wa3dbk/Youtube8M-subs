apparently he's been watching some of my
videos<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:08.280> several<00:00:08.880> years<00:00:09.150> ago<00:00:09.300> where<00:00:10.050> my

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
videos from several years ago where my

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.770 
videos from several years ago where my
voice<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> much<00:00:11.280> higher<00:00:11.340> pitch<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.330> he

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
voice was at a much higher pitch and he

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.049 
voice was at a much higher pitch and he
notices<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.710> much<00:00:13.950> deeper<00:00:14.280> now<00:00:14.700> and

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
notices that it's much deeper now and

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.680 
notices that it's much deeper now and
what<00:00:15.570> I'm<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.020> call<00:00:16.320> more<00:00:17.029> grounded<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
what I'm going to call more grounded so

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.400 
what I'm going to call more grounded so
the<00:00:19.470> long<00:00:19.710> story<00:00:20.310> short<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.199> since<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the long story short is that since I

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.689 
the long story short is that since I
discovered<00:00:23.600> bioenergetics<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> how<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
discovered bioenergetics and how the

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
discovered bioenergetics and how the
body<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> manifestation<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
body is a manifestation of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.269 
body is a manifestation of the
psychological<00:00:30.470> character<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:31.679> individual

psychological character of an individual

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.069 
psychological character of an individual
and<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.149> create<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> call

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and that we can create what I call

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.000 
and that we can create what I call
neurotic<00:00:34.649> holding<00:00:34.950> patterns<00:00:35.340> where<00:00:35.940> the

was a uptight rigid individual my energy

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
was a uptight rigid individual my energy
was<00:01:16.560> way<00:01:17.100> too<00:01:17.159> high<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:17.970> why<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> use

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
was way too high and that's why I use

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
was way too high and that's why I use
the<00:01:18.479> term<00:01:18.509> grounded<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.170> now<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:20.100> I've

muscles and allow my energy to drive
much<00:01:29.670> deeper<00:01:30.390> often<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.290> talk<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.619> breathing

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
much deeper often I talk about breathing

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
much deeper often I talk about breathing
into<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.460> balls<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.390> before<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> was

into your balls well before I was

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.609 
into your balls well before I was
breathing<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.790> castrated<00:01:36.509> fashion

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
went lower than my chest right because I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.600 
went lower than my chest right because I
had<00:01:43.170> muscular<00:01:43.380> armoring<00:01:44.009> across<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> belly

grounded so long story short again my

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
grounded so long story short again my
ability<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> breathe<00:01:53.009> deeper<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.909> bring

but<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> also<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.440> lot<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:59.060> grounding

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
but I also do a lot of grounding

but I also do a lot of grounding
exercises<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.500> call<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.950> ground<00:03:02.370> bounce

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
exercises I call this the ground bounce

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240 
exercises I call this the ground bounce
and<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.630> part<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.959> my<00:03:04.530> bioenergetic

warm-up routine I'll put up another link
if<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.410> remember<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.070> that's<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.459> my<00:03:08.579> other

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
if I remember to that that's on my other

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.759 
if I remember to that that's on my other
channel<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.019> goes<00:03:10.380> something<00:03:10.620> like

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
channel but it's it goes something like

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.759 
channel but it's it goes something like
this<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.310> wear<00:03:12.060> no<00:03:12.540> shoes<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.260> often<00:03:13.620> times

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
this I wear no shoes and often times

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.170 
this I wear no shoes and often times
when<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.980> make<00:03:14.130> these<00:03:14.250> videos<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.700> take<00:03:14.850> my<00:03:14.970> shoes

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
when I make these videos I take my shoes

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.420 
when I make these videos I take my shoes
off<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> helps<00:03:16.560> bring<00:03:16.920> my<00:03:17.100> energy

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
off because it helps bring my energy

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.759 
off because it helps bring my energy
down<00:03:17.610> energy<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:18.989> people<00:03:19.500> get<00:03:19.590> kind

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
down energy is you know people get kind

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.020 
down energy is you know people get kind
of<00:03:19.860> confused<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.549> think<00:03:20.760> when<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.000> use

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
of confused and they think when you use

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.310 
of confused and they think when you use
the<00:03:21.269> term<00:03:21.420> energy<00:03:21.630> you're<00:03:21.959> talking<00:03:22.230> about

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the term energy you're talking about

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.060 
the term energy you're talking about
like<00:03:22.560> some<00:03:22.739> hocus<00:03:23.040> pocus<00:03:23.070> magic<00:03:24.709> force<00:03:25.709> field

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
like some hocus pocus magic force field

like some hocus pocus magic force field
that's<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.970> don't<00:03:27.420> know<00:03:27.480> they<00:03:27.660> get<00:03:28.110> all

your<00:04:09.239> mouth<00:04:09.450> open<00:04:10.819> while<00:04:11.819> you're<00:04:11.970> doing<00:04:12.330> that

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
your mouth open while you're doing that

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.330 
your mouth open while you're doing that

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
relax a lot of the muscles that are in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.540
