00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
about cutting wedding cakes you make a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.410 
about cutting wedding cakes you make a
square<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.130> then<00:01:06.970> you're<00:01:07.060> going<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.210> cut

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
square and then you're going to cut

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.210 
square and then you're going to cut
exactly<00:01:07.869> equal<00:01:08.320> portions<00:01:08.770> if<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.070> have<00:01:09.159> a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
exactly equal portions if you have a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.410 
exactly equal portions if you have a
tiny<00:01:09.430> cake<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:09.939> have<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.060> birthday<00:01:10.270> party

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
tiny cake and you have a birthday party

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.300 
tiny cake and you have a birthday party
it's<00:01:11.229> fine<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.500> do<00:01:11.619> slices<00:01:12.009> all<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.220> way

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
it's fine to do slices all the way

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's fine to do slices all the way
around<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:12.759> for<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.939> wedding<00:01:13.240> cake<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.600> want

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
around but for a wedding cake you want

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.570 
around but for a wedding cake you want
every<00:01:13.990> slice<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.409> be<00:01:14.470> exactly<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.130> same<00:01:15.159> and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
every slice to be exactly the same and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.520 
every slice to be exactly the same and
the<00:01:15.850> way<00:01:15.939> you<00:01:16.000> do<00:01:16.149> that<00:01:16.299> is<00:01:16.570> by<00:01:16.960> making<00:01:16.990> this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
the way you do that is by making this

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.010 
the way you do that is by making this
into<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.310> square<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:19.630> does<00:01:19.810> mean<00:01:19.960> you're

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
into a square that does mean you're

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.570 
into a square that does mean you're
going<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.350> some<00:01:20.560> waste<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.190> if<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.490> go

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
going to have some waste and if you go

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.950 
going to have some waste and if you go
to<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.820> back<00:01:22.000> you'll<00:01:22.270> probably<00:01:22.479> find<00:01:22.840> your

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
to the back you'll probably find your

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960 
to the back you'll probably find your
caterers<00:01:23.440> feasting<00:01:24.189> on<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.340> little<00:01:24.670> scraps

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
caterers feasting on the little scraps

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.179 
caterers feasting on the little scraps
left<00:01:25.210> behind<00:01:25.539> sirs<00:01:25.840> there's<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.799> lot<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.039> left

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
left behind sirs there's a lot of left

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.609 
left behind sirs there's a lot of left
in<00:01:27.340> there<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:27.899> as<00:01:28.899> part<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.110> my<00:01:29.200> wedding<00:01:29.380> cakes

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
in there but as part of my wedding cakes

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.990 
in there but as part of my wedding cakes
are<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:29.860> expensive<00:01:30.159> as<00:01:30.399> well<00:01:30.430> because<00:01:30.850> there's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
are so expensive as well because there's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.880 
are so expensive as well because there's
some<00:01:31.149> waste<00:01:31.360> involved<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.590> first<00:01:32.770> thing

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
some waste involved so the first thing

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.980 
some waste involved so the first thing
I'm<00:01:32.979> going<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> do<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.520> with<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> long<00:01:34.690> serrated

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
I'm going to do is with a long serrated

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:53.200 
I'm going to do is with a long serrated
blade<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.840> go<00:01:38.020> straight<00:01:38.500> down<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.830> side

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.120 

there's<00:01:54.210> our<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.600> outside<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.980> will

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
there's our one outside which I will

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
there's our one outside which I will
discard

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.300 

it's<00:02:05.200> tricky<00:02:05.470> too<00:02:05.590> because<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.979> cake<00:02:06.159> has

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
it's tricky too because the cake has

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.800 
it's tricky too because the cake has
likely<00:02:06.520> been<00:02:06.670> sitting<00:02:07.120> out<00:02:07.270> for<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.540> number<00:02:07.630> of

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
likely been sitting out for a number of

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.240 
likely been sitting out for a number of
hours<00:02:08.170> which<00:02:08.560> means<00:02:08.590> it's<00:02:08.979> at<00:02:09.070> its<00:02:09.190> most

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
hours which means it's at its most

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.490 
hours which means it's at its most
delicious<00:02:09.850> because<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.270> room<00:02:10.420> temperature

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
delicious because it's room temperature

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.750 
delicious because it's room temperature
but<00:02:11.500> at<00:02:11.590> its<00:02:11.740> most<00:02:11.860> difficult<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.400> cut<00:02:12.580> because

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
but at its most difficult to cut because

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.800 
but at its most difficult to cut because
it's<00:02:13.030> soft

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.740 

or<00:02:18.200> scrap

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:34.880 

you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.349 

so<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:36.129> going<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.370> go<00:02:36.579> through<00:02:37.209> the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
so now I'm going to go through the

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.420 
so now I'm going to go through the
