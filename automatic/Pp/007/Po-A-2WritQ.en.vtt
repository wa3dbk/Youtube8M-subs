00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
now and this is the result that we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.279 
now and this is the result that we
achieved<00:00:49.489> right<00:00:50.120> now<00:00:50.359> we<00:00:50.480> have<00:00:50.659> a<00:00:50.690> completely

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
achieved right now we have a completely

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.430 
achieved right now we have a completely
automated<00:00:52.070> warehouse<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:53.839> employees<00:00:54.230> have

automated warehouse the employees have

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.279 
automated warehouse the employees have
24/7<00:00:55.249> access<00:00:55.629> because<00:00:56.629> it's<00:00:56.780> completely

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
24/7 access because it's completely

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.739 
24/7 access because it's completely
secured<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:57.949> they<00:00:58.100> come<00:00:58.339> in<00:00:58.550> from<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.390> locked

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
secured so they come in from the locked

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.739 
secured so they come in from the locked
door<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:00.589> type<00:01:01.579> in<00:01:01.760> their<00:01:01.909> code<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.390> they

door and type in their code and they
have<00:01:02.839> access<00:01:03.229> to<00:01:03.289> all<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.890> items<00:01:04.220> that

have access to all of the items that
they<00:01:04.670> want<00:01:05.200> we<00:01:06.200> are<00:01:06.290> not<00:01:06.409> just<00:01:06.590> vending<00:01:07.040> small

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
they want we are not just vending small

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.060 
they want we are not just vending small
parts<00:01:07.790> together<00:01:08.300> with<00:01:08.630> personnel<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.170> came<00:01:09.409> to

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
parts together with personnel we came to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.700 
parts together with personnel we came to
a<00:01:10.100> solution<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.820> store<00:01:11.210> big<00:01:12.020> stuff<00:01:12.440> in

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
a solution to store big stuff in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.620 
a solution to store big stuff in
machines<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.700> won't<00:01:13.939> even<00:01:14.180> think<00:01:14.450> about

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
machines that you won't even think about

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.620 
machines that you won't even think about
for<00:01:15.380> example<00:01:15.409> we<00:01:15.979> store<00:01:16.250> shovels<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:17.420> have

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
for example we store shovels we have

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.340 
for example we store shovels we have
absorbent<00:01:18.380> big<00:01:19.100> box<00:01:19.460> toilet<00:01:20.030> paper<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:21.049> this

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
absorbent big box toilet paper so this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.270 
absorbent big box toilet paper so this
is<00:01:21.500> not<00:01:21.680> your<00:01:21.890> typical<00:01:22.070> vending<00:01:22.759> machine<00:01:23.180> idea

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
is not your typical vending machine idea

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.039 
is not your typical vending machine idea
really<00:01:25.280> molded<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.000> customize<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.930> meet

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
really molded and customize it to meet

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.410 
really molded and customize it to meet
all<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.590> city<00:01:27.799> needs<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.310> no<00:01:28.490> exception<00:01:29.180> I

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
all the city needs with no exception I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.029 
all the city needs with no exception I
think<00:01:29.840> some<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.170> main<00:01:30.350> benefits<00:01:30.380> right

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
think some of the main benefits right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.910 
think some of the main benefits right
now<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.610> just<00:01:32.149> being<00:01:32.539> able<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:32.899> have<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
now is just being able to have the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.219 
now is just being able to have the
employees<00:01:34.520> come<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.390> be<00:01:35.630> able<00:01:35.719> to<00:01:35.960> access

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
employees come in and be able to access

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.529 
employees come in and be able to access
the<00:01:36.890> correct<00:01:37.340> material<00:01:38.000> for<00:01:38.180> them<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.390> get

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
the correct material for them to get

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.990 
the correct material for them to get
their<00:01:38.689> job<00:01:38.930> done<00:01:38.960> on<00:01:39.289> day<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.590> day<00:01:40.000> everything

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
their job done on day to day everything

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.810 
their job done on day to day everything
is<00:01:41.030> live<00:01:41.329> time<00:01:41.719> reporting<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.130> Dana

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
is live time reporting so Dana

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.730 
is live time reporting so Dana
actually<00:01:44.299> just<00:01:44.479> has<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> custom<00:01:45.140> report<00:01:45.259> that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
actually just has a custom report that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.520 
actually just has a custom report that
she<00:01:45.859> has<00:01:45.979> emailed<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.640> her<00:01:46.820> once<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.780> week<00:01:47.810> she

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
she has emailed to her once a week she

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.649 
she has emailed to her once a week she
can<00:01:48.680> now<00:01:48.799> go<00:01:49.070> through<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.460> report<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.180> see

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
can now go through this report and see

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.840 
can now go through this report and see
who<00:01:50.869> took<00:01:51.079> what<00:01:51.380> when<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.799> where<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.280> then

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
who took what when and where and then

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.490 
who took what when and where and then
make<00:01:53.090> sure<00:01:53.119> it's<00:01:53.539> appropriate<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:54.380> the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
make sure it's appropriate to the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.440 
make sure it's appropriate to the
different<00:01:54.770> departments<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:55.880> just<00:01:56.090> being<00:01:56.270> very

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
different departments so just being very

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.690 
different departments so just being very
transparent<00:01:56.780> has<00:01:57.469> been<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.799> think<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.369> main

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
transparent has been I think the main

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.419 
transparent has been I think the main
thing<00:01:58.729> each<00:01:59.600> bin<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.380> thought<00:02:00.649> has<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> minimum

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
thing each bin of thought has a minimum

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.149 
thing each bin of thought has a minimum
point<00:02:01.729> once<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.899> item<00:02:03.350> which<00:02:03.500> depletes<00:02:03.979> at

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
point once that item which depletes at

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.910 
point once that item which depletes at
minimum<00:02:04.609> point<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.179> think<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.960> machines<00:02:06.350> shoot

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
minimum point I think the machines shoot

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.850 
minimum point I think the machines shoot
a<00:02:06.950> message<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.909> vendor<00:02:08.300> fresnel<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.679> come

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
a message to the vendor fresnel to come

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.940
