developing for nine month that is purely
inspired<00:00:21.480> by<00:00:21.689> skate<00:00:22.050> 3<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.789> BMX<00:00:24.300> game

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
inspired by skate 3 and it's a BMX game

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.519 
inspired by skate 3 and it's a BMX game
called<00:00:25.320> BMX<00:00:25.710> ride<00:00:26.070> also<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.570> engine

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
called BMX ride also it is in engine

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.890 
called BMX ride also it is in engine
alpha<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.580> its<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.660> early

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
alpha it's in its if it's really early

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
alpha it's in its if it's really early
alpha<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> think<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:32.250> there's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.790> lot<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
alpha I think because there's a lot of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.450 
alpha I think because there's a lot of
bugs<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.200> makes<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> game<00:00:34.680> quite<00:00:35.070> fun<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
bugs but that makes the game quite fun I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
bugs but that makes the game quite fun I
think<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:37.350> thing<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
think and the thing is that he has a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
think and the thing is that he has a
park<00:00:38.370> editor<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.660> gonna
