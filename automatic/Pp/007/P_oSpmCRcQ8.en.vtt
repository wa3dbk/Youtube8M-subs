call<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> carbonate<00:02:28.640> rock<00:02:29.600> which<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.890> you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
call a carbonate rock which is if you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.770 
call a carbonate rock which is if you
just<00:02:31.400> look<00:02:31.640> at<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.120> looks<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:32.450> kind<00:02:32.750> of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
just look at it it looks like kind of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.160 
just look at it it looks like kind of
like<00:02:32.900> concrete<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.370> been<00:02:34.640> dissolved

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
like concrete but it's been dissolved

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.440 
like concrete but it's been dissolved
over<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.799> historical<00:02:37.130> geologic<00:02:37.970> time<00:02:38.180> such

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
over the historical geologic time such

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.990 
over the historical geologic time such
that<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:38.750> full<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.110> holes<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.769> becomes<00:02:40.700> very

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that it's full of holes and becomes very

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.210 
that it's full of holes and becomes very
transmissive<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.079> we<00:02:42.200> wanted<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
transmissive so we wanted to see if that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.759 
transmissive so we wanted to see if that
was<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.640> case<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.079> drilled<00:02:45.410> what<00:02:45.650> we

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
was the case and so we drilled what we

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.759 
was the case and so we drilled what we
call<00:02:45.980> test<00:02:46.310> 12-1<00:02:46.880> into<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.989> rock<00:02:48.260> type<00:02:48.560> to

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
call test 12-1 into that rock type to

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.539 
call test 12-1 into that rock type to
see<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.700> indeed<00:02:50.239> has<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:51.410> lot<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.280> like

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
see if it indeed has a lot of the like

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.210 
see if it indeed has a lot of the like
cavernous<00:02:53.180> materials<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:54.440> caves<00:02:54.770> if<00:02:55.099> you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
cavernous materials so like caves if you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.860 
cavernous materials so like caves if you
want<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.520> think<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.420> because

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
want to think of it that that because

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.240 
want to think of it that that because
that's<00:02:57.020> what<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.290> is

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
that's what it is

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.410 
that's what it is
does<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.849> exist<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> subsurface<00:03:01.420> in

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
does that exist in the subsurface in

to apply that model and update those
estimates<00:06:03.150> I'm<00:06:03.990> always<00:06:04.260> amazed<00:06:04.770> every<00:06:05.040> time<00:06:05.070> I

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
estimates I'm always amazed every time I

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.730 
estimates I'm always amazed every time I
come<00:06:05.490> out<00:06:05.640> here<00:06:05.670> and<00:06:05.880> how<00:06:06.000> vast<00:06:06.390> this<00:06:07.230> this

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
come out here and how vast this this

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.480 
come out here and how vast this this
watershed<00:06:08.250> is<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.820> how<00:06:09.750> how<00:06:10.230> large<00:06:10.620> of<00:06:11.010> a

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
watershed is and how how large of a

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.760 
watershed is and how how large of a
basin<00:06:11.880> it<00:06:12.000> is<00:06:12.150> it<00:06:12.360> just<00:06:12.540> takes<00:06:12.690> you<00:06:12.930> literally

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
basin it is it just takes you literally

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.190 
basin it is it just takes you literally
a<00:06:13.920> couple<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.550> days<00:06:14.700> to<00:06:15.060> to<00:06:15.450> drive<00:06:15.660> around<00:06:15.840> it

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
a couple of days to to drive around it

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.170 
a couple of days to to drive around it
and<00:06:16.410> so<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:18.600> basin<00:06:19.160> itself<00:06:20.160> has<00:06:20.490> a

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
and so the the basin itself has a

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.300 
and so the the basin itself has a
tremendous<00:06:21.720> volume<00:06:21.930> of<00:06:22.320> water<00:06:22.560> and<00:06:22.800> storage

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
tremendous volume of water and storage

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.990 
tremendous volume of water and storage
and<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:24.120> guess<00:06:24.300> I<00:06:24.480> could<00:06:24.720> probably<00:06:25.200> easily

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
and I guess I could probably easily

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.460 
and I guess I could probably easily
compare<00:06:27.000> that<00:06:27.210> to<00:06:27.270> something<00:06:27.690> that<00:06:27.870> someone

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
compare that to something that someone

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.260 
compare that to something that someone
might<00:06:28.920> be<00:06:28.950> familiar<00:06:29.460> with<00:06:29.580> as<00:06:29.820> a<00:06:29.850> surface

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
might be familiar with as a surface

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.480 
might be familiar with as a surface

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.750 
renewable resource and the reason is
water<00:06:55.230> that<00:06:55.650> is<00:06:55.860> removed

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
water that is removed

water that is removed
from<00:06:56.910> the<00:06:57.090> aquifers<00:06:57.720> by<00:06:58.350> pumping<00:06:58.680> is

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
from the aquifers by pumping is

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.820 
from the aquifers by pumping is
replenished<00:07:00.950> using<00:07:01.950> natural<00:07:02.550> recharge<00:07:03.090> and

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
replenished using natural recharge and

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.350 
replenished using natural recharge and
imported<00:07:04.830> water<00:07:05.100> water<00:07:05.520> that's<00:07:05.640> brought<00:07:06.120> in

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
imported water water that's brought in

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.500 
imported water water that's brought in
and<00:07:06.600> put<00:07:06.630> in<00:07:07.350> basins<00:07:07.890> just<00:07:08.520> like<00:07:08.730> these<00:07:08.970> behind

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
and put in basins just like these behind

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.240 
and put in basins just like these behind
me<00:07:10.700> Cadiz<00:07:11.700> is<00:07:11.730> is<00:07:12.300> really<00:07:13.070> could<00:07:14.070> be<00:07:14.160> an

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
me Cadiz is is really could be an

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.820 
me Cadiz is is really could be an
important<00:07:14.700> part<00:07:14.880> of<00:07:15.060> the<00:07:15.180> resource<00:07:15.600> mix<00:07:16.020> for

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
important part of the resource mix for

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.400 
important part of the resource mix for
water<00:07:17.040> supply<00:07:17.250> to<00:07:17.910> to<00:07:18.480> Southern<00:07:18.780> California

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
water supply to to Southern California

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.520 
water supply to to Southern California
this<00:07:19.860> could<00:07:20.130> really<00:07:20.310> be<00:07:20.460> just<00:07:20.940> another

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
this could really be just another

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.350 
this could really be just another
component<00:07:22.530> of<00:07:22.860> that<00:07:23.100> portfolio<00:07:23.520> of<00:07:24.090> water

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
component of that portfolio of water

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.380 
component of that portfolio of water
supply<00:07:24.780> to<00:07:24.840> really<00:07:25.350> help<00:07:25.590> assure<00:07:26.580> the

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
supply to really help assure the

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.990 
supply to really help assure the
long-term<00:07:27.780> water<00:07:27.990> supply<00:07:28.110> of<00:07:28.470> the<00:07:28.800> region<00:07:29.250> and

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
long-term water supply of the region and

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.610 
long-term water supply of the region and
I<00:07:30.120> think<00:07:30.150> if<00:07:30.450> it's<00:07:30.600> used<00:07:30.870> in<00:07:31.140> a<00:07:31.260> sensible

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
I think if it's used in a sensible

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.210 
I think if it's used in a sensible
manner<00:07:31.740> it<00:07:32.400> should<00:07:32.670> be<00:07:32.820> sustainable

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
manner it should be sustainable

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.399 
manner it should be sustainable
indefinitely

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:41.409 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:43.469
