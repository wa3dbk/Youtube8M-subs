00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
didn't feel anything for some odd reason

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
didn't feel anything for some odd reason
it<00:01:36.810> took<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.049> another<00:01:37.259> week<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.560> two<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.770> got

it took like another week or two I got
it<00:01:38.159> fixed<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.090> since<00:01:39.329> I've<00:01:39.450> always<00:01:39.689> been

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it fixed but since I've always been

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
it fixed but since I've always been
really<00:01:40.020> cautious<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.860> don't<00:01:41.400> visit

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
really cautious because I don't visit

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
really cautious because I don't visit
the<00:01:41.909> dentist<00:01:42.090> very<00:01:42.570> regularly<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.320> brush

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the dentist very regularly I do brush

all<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.360> pretty

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
all the time and I think I take pretty

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
all the time and I think I take pretty
good<00:01:45.689> care<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.049> my<00:01:46.259> teeth<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.250> never<00:01:47.280> know

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
good care of my teeth but you never know

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.800 
good care of my teeth but you never know
like<00:01:47.850> I'm<00:01:48.030> probably<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.600> eight

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
like I'm probably got like eight

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.060 
like I'm probably got like eight
cavities<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.860> hit

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
cavities right now and if I hit

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.380 
cavities right now and if I hit
something<00:01:50.369> hard<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.670> there<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.240> gonna

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
something hard on there it's just gonna

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.300 
something hard on there it's just gonna
totally<00:01:51.780> break<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.079> open<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:53.159> good

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
totally break it open these are good

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
totally break it open these are good
because<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.850> did<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> these<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:54.869> good

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
because I just did it these are good

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
because I just did it these are good
because<00:01:55.560> they're<00:01:56.219> nerds<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
because they're nerds but it's got the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.300 
because they're nerds but it's got the
gummy<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.049> well<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.070> me<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
gummy in it as well and to me it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.060 
gummy in it as well and to me it
counteracts<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.240> hardness<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
counteracts the hardness I know that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.350 
counteracts the hardness I know that
that<00:02:02.280> sounds<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.060> she<00:02:03.180> says

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that sounds like that's what she says

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.330 
that sounds like that's what she says
joke<00:02:03.540> oh<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.229> open<00:02:04.530> oh<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.159> not

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
joke oh I think it's open oh that's not

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
joke oh I think it's open oh that's not
good<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:06.299> probably<00:02:06.600> isn't<00:02:06.750> gonna<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> very

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
good this probably isn't gonna be a very

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.430 
good this probably isn't gonna be a very
good<00:02:07.469> version<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> then

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
good version of it then

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.050 
good version of it then
oh<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.920> think<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.430> has<00:02:09.550> been<00:02:09.580> open<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:09.910> a
