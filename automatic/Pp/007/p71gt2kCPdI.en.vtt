00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.760
 I bring you a video about gta 4 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.509
 good in this video I'm going to teach 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.539
 how to increase the 2 fps of our grand 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.640
 theft auto 4 good I had done 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.890
 previously many videos accelerate 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.260
 our gta 4 I also made one similar 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.210
 to this one that is of command and this one goes 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.820
 to be my command and good to explain a 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.070
 little more that in another video that I made of 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.439
 good line, I did it again because 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.960
 this one is as more updated this 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:40.899
 I think 2014 was 2010 and good and 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.510
 that now will discover we put the best 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.370
 way to accelerate our gta 4 and good 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.660
 it's with how andy laine ok it 's like the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.149
 I'll leave it in the description 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.030
 of the video this has gone up half way 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.309
 obviously it is a text file which 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.700
 Nobody weighs anything that you do not 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.460
 has virus warning altiro 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.350
 well what are we going to do once 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.190
 downloaded as andy laine is going to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.050
 leave this a text file 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.730
 and what we are going to do is follow the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.480
 director and our grand theft auto 4 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.740
 in my case I have in 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.740
 on the desk 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.840
 we are going to right click on the icon 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.840
 of gta 4 and let's press where it says 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.939
 open the file location and we're going 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.520
 to open the location of General 4 we go 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.070
 to paste here the command that we had 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.890
 copied to me asks me to replace what I'm going to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.170
 replace so they see what works and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.119
 we close now what we are going to do is 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.729
 the following we will execute our 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.679
 gta 4 as administrator for it we go 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.830
 to give it right click execute as 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.360
 administrator here will open the permit 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.940
 of control of user accounts we are going to 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.940
 give it like this and the moments are going to run 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.450
 and so, here we are going to wait here for the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.880
 game will be 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.000
