00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
roundhouse fair enough let's see how

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
roundhouse fair enough let's see how
we're<00:00:47.640> gonna<00:00:47.730> formulate<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> remember<00:00:48.989> when

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
we're gonna formulate it remember when

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.979 
we're gonna formulate it remember when
you<00:00:49.200> throw<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.070> combination<00:00:50.670> fast<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you throw the combination fast all the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590 
you throw the combination fast all the
priorities<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.640> final<00:00:54.030> strike<00:00:54.300> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
priorities put into the final strike so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.580 
priorities put into the final strike so
if<00:00:54.660> we're<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> jab<00:00:55.289> cross<00:00:55.469> hook

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
if we're going to do a jab cross hook

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
if we're going to do a jab cross hook
and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> fast<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.719> hook<00:00:57.930> would

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and I want to do it fast the hook would

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
and I want to do it fast the hook would
have<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> priority<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.430> you're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
have the priority but if you're going to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
have the priority but if you're going to
slow<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> combination<00:01:00.870> down<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.680> can

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
slow the combination down then you can

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.380 
slow the combination down then you can
focus<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.309> each<00:01:02.460> individual<00:01:02.910> strike<00:01:03.210> and
