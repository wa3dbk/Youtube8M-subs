00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
ahead and add a new one all right now I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
ahead and add a new one all right now I
can<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.560> ahead<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.210> pretty

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
can go ahead and this right is pretty

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.609 
can go ahead and this right is pretty
accurate<00:01:27.479> take<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> look<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> one

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
accurate take a look at the one to one

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.460 
accurate take a look at the one to one
here<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> pipe<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:31.020> look

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here so I go as I it's a pipe it look

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.649 
here so I go as I it's a pipe it look
like<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.770> falling<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.280> pretty<00:01:33.119> closely

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
like it's falling it pretty closely

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
like it's falling it pretty closely
that's<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> quick<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.340> ahead

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that's a quick look at that to go ahead

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
that's a quick look at that to go ahead
and<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.060> home<00:01:36.299> hit<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> giant<00:01:37.200> home<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and go home hit that giant home but the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.050 
and go home hit that giant home but the
big<00:01:37.890> question<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.430> does<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> feel<00:01:38.939> in

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
big question here is how does it feel in

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
big question here is how does it feel in
the<00:01:39.119> hand<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.600> could<00:01:40.259> use<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> phone<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the hand and could use as a phone and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.310 
the hand and could use as a phone and
the<00:01:41.220> answer<00:01:41.490> seems<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.000> yes<00:01:42.329> it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
