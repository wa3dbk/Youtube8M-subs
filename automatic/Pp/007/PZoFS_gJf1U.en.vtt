00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.220 
that I created on the 4th of July

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.140 
that I created on the 4th of July
I<00:00:11.490> had<00:00:12.180> this<00:00:12.300> flag<00:00:13.730> hanging<00:00:14.730> around<00:00:15.030> my

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
I had this flag hanging around my

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.300 
I had this flag hanging around my
workshop<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.900> years<00:00:16.349> and<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.650> finally<00:00:16.980> decided

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
workshop for years and I finally decided

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.329 
workshop for years and I finally decided
I<00:00:17.490> wanted<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.910> display<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.650> printed<00:00:20.099> out

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:20.339 
I wanted to display it so I printed out

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.839 
I wanted to display it so I printed out
this<00:00:20.720> half<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.929> a<00:00:22.019> star<00:00:22.289> template<00:00:22.949> traced

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
this half of a star template traced

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
this half of a star template traced
around<00:00:24.179> it<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.509> some<00:00:24.720> pine<00:00:26.749> and<00:00:27.749> I<00:00:28.230> cut<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
around it on some pine and I cut the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.759 
around it on some pine and I cut the
wood<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:30.149> a<00:00:30.210> 45<00:00:30.779> degree<00:00:30.810> angle<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.989> as<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.620> go

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
wood at a 45 degree angle and as we go

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.330 
wood at a 45 degree angle and as we go
along<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.430> you'll<00:00:35.699> see<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.680> when<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
along here you'll see why when it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.860 
along here you'll see why when it
finally<00:00:38.640> comes<00:00:38.940> together<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> couple

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
finally comes together in a couple

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.490 
finally comes together in a couple
minutes

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
minutes

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.790 
minutes
but<00:00:41.480> basically<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> cut<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.410> three<00:00:44.960> half<00:00:45.960> star

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
but basically I cut out three half star

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.630 
but basically I cut out three half star
shapes<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.320> glued<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.500> together<00:00:49.679> which

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
shapes and glued them together which

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
shapes and glued them together which
you'll<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> minute<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.679> is<00:00:52.829> me

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
you'll see in a minute and this is me

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
you'll see in a minute and this is me
cutting<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:53.940> star<00:00:54.870> shapes<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
cutting out these star shapes on the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.419 
cutting out these star shapes on the
bandsaw<00:00:57.230> I'm<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.469> using<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.829> quarter<00:00:59.190> inch

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
bandsaw I'm just using a quarter inch

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.630 
bandsaw I'm just using a quarter inch
blade<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.749> like<00:01:00.870> eight<00:01:01.339> teeth<00:01:02.339> per

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
blade I think it's like eight teeth per

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.870 
blade I think it's like eight teeth per
inch<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> gives<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> smooth<00:01:04.559> cut<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:08.550> I<00:01:08.610> sped

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
inch so it gives a smooth cut and I sped

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020 
inch so it gives a smooth cut and I sped
it<00:01:08.910> up<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.720> boring<00:01:10.700> but<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.000> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it up so it's not so boring but here I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.230 
it up so it's not so boring but here I
am<00:01:12.120> sanding<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.050> sanding<00:01:13.500> some<00:01:13.890> more

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
am sanding and sanding some more

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.960

gonna<00:01:22.020> glue<00:01:22.440> these<00:01:22.770> three<00:01:23.310> half<00:01:24.240> star<00:01:24.690> shapes

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
gonna glue these three half star shapes

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.700 
gonna glue these three half star shapes
together<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.630> make<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.660> wall<00:01:27.960> mount<00:01:28.230> for<00:01:28.530> my

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
together and make a wall mount for my

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
together and make a wall mount for my
flag<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.080> angles<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:32.130> tricky<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
flag so the angles got a little tricky I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.140 
flag so the angles got a little tricky I
had<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.200> recut<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.550> piece<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
had to actually recut this piece that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
had to actually recut this piece that
I'm<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> glue<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:39.620> but<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:41.010> fit

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
I'm about to glue on now but it fit

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.610 
I'm about to glue on now but it fit
together<00:01:41.580> pretty<00:01:42.000> nicely<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:42.990> did<00:01:43.440> was

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
together pretty nicely all I did was

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.180 
together pretty nicely all I did was
glue<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:43.950> together<00:01:45.680> because<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> wasn't<00:01:47.100> gonna

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
glue it together because it wasn't gonna

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.150 
glue it together because it wasn't gonna
hold<00:01:47.400> anything<00:01:47.760> heavy<00:01:48.150> just<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.920> flag

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
hold anything heavy just that the flag

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.100 
hold anything heavy just that the flag
but<00:01:53.160> that's<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.150> gist<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.510> it<00:01:54.690> right

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
but that's kind of the gist of it right

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.670 
but that's kind of the gist of it right
there<00:01:55.370> I<00:01:56.370> drilled<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.940> hole<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.720> same<00:01:57.930> size<00:01:58.230> as

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
there I drilled a hole the same size as

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.230 
there I drilled a hole the same size as
the<00:01:59.690> dowel<00:02:00.690> rod<00:02:00.870> that<00:02:01.170> flag<00:02:01.470> was<00:02:01.650> on<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the dowel rod that flag was on so I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.440 
the dowel rod that flag was on so I
could<00:02:03.540> put<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.780> flag<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:05.060> cleaned<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.180> some

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
could put the flag in it cleaned up some

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.050 
could put the flag in it cleaned up some
of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.980> glue<00:02:07.980> squeeze-out<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.879> some

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
of the glue squeeze-out with some

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120 
of the glue squeeze-out with some
sandpaper<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:10.379> put<00:02:10.560> some<00:02:10.740> double-stick

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
sandpaper just put some double-stick

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.000 
sandpaper just put some double-stick
carpet<00:02:11.790> tape<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.330> back

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
carpet tape on the back

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.210 
carpet tape on the back
and<00:02:14.099> stuck<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:14.939> wall<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.989> put<00:02:16.769> my<00:02:16.920> flag

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and stuck it on the wall and put my flag

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.140 
and stuck it on the wall and put my flag
in<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:17.970> my<00:02:18.150> flag<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.599> displayed<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
in it so now my flag is displayed and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.729 
in it so now my flag is displayed and
it's<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.360> hidden<00:02:21.599> up<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.989> some<00:02:22.349> shelf

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
it's not hidden up on some shelf

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.490 
it's not hidden up on some shelf
somewhere<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.939> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> really<00:02:25.170> cool

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
somewhere so this is a really cool

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.610
