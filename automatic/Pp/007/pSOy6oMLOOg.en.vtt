00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
release it and I'm just try and pin it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.660 
release it and I'm just try and pin it
as<00:02:11.790> best<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.770> mine<00:02:14.310> aren't

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
as best you can so like mine aren't

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.080 
as best you can so like mine aren't
perfect<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:17.090> holding

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
perfect but as you can see it's holding

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
perfect but as you can see it's holding
the<00:02:18.420> curl<00:02:18.870> somewhat<00:02:19.590> i'm<00:02:20.099> going<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.640> take<00:02:24.110> one

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the curl somewhat i'm going to take one

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.580 
the curl somewhat i'm going to take one
of<00:02:25.200> my<00:02:25.290> layers<00:02:26.569> this<00:02:27.569> time<00:02:27.930> instead<00:02:28.380> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of my layers this time instead of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.270 
of my layers this time instead of
curling<00:02:29.269> outward<00:02:30.269> you're<00:02:30.300> gonna<00:02:30.720> curl<00:02:31.940> inward

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
curling outward you're gonna curl inward

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:47.470 
curling outward you're gonna curl inward
so<00:02:35.280> or<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.299> should<00:02:36.989> yeah<00:02:37.290> inward<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.350> this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.420 

you<00:02:48.019> can<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.349> i'm<00:02:48.470> still<00:02:48.530> laying<00:02:49.099> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you can see i'm still laying it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.940 
you can see i'm still laying it
completely<00:02:50.300> flat<00:02:51.489> my<00:02:52.489> hair<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.090> cut<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.200> out

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
completely flat my hair is cut in out

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.020 
completely flat my hair is cut in out
tiny<00:02:55.580> layers<00:02:55.909> so<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.540> gets<00:02:56.629> harder<00:02:57.049> for<00:02:57.260> me<00:02:57.409> to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
tiny layers so it gets harder for me to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.070 
tiny layers so it gets harder for me to
get<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.450> pieces<00:02:59.690> but<00:03:00.409> that<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:01.330> AOK<00:03:02.330> o
