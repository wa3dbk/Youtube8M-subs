00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.880
 Hi everyone, alright, thanks for being 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.780
 watching this video and this video here 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.750
 It's to celebrate 1 year and 4 months here. 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.720
 canon sx 50 hs 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.800
 We've already been with her for a year and four 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.780
 months and she has done her good work 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.220
 It has lasted a lot yes I have used 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.010
 it's a well used one because I use the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.559
 cameras as if it were a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.520
 professional camera even so use 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.280
 fairly wide and used in all forms 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.220
 nor of the hardest possible forms 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 in this unfortunate several sequences I did 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:54.370
 with 11,779 photographs and recorded more 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.940
 of two hundred hours of video in 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.730
 full hd in all kinds of format and 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.250
 everything but she did not have any 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.780
 accident has not suffered any accident 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.000
 fell or anything 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.710
 I took a shower with her but did not 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.950
 Nothing happened if it did not get wet. 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.170
 she but the bag got all wet but not 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.570
 Nothing happened to her, she is. 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.479
 working perfectly still with e 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.930
 It's very good, right? 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.690
 even after almost 12 thousand photographs 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.760
 and more than two hundred hours of 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.979
 videos I used to record videos 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.150
 School's and everything. 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.560
 and she's still perfect so she's alone. 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.850
 had two loaves so far and I do not know the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.790
 What happened is not stupid or 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.060
 it just stopped working 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.369
 so the nessie was on but I 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.799
 I just took the battery back. 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.049
 it worked normally again then 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.680
 did not have any more serious problems nor 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.229
 nothing like that was just one more caught 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.729
 locked twice and that's what 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.130
 happened to her 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.650
 The other thing I did was also 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.390
 to buy a new battery for her. 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.539
 type or generic 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.060
 because her original battery so she 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.830
 gave a fat one here and now I 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.040
 I bought this one, which is another 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.620
 generic here a battery I bought 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.660
 In China I also paid for cheap. Yes, it is. 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.230
 it costs 80 reais here in Sao 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.910
 paulo I paid 18 reais so let's go 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.700
 start testing your battery has arrived 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.410
 these days here and let's start 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.900
 test it here too to see with the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.489
 time durability that she will have right 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.560
 It's working fine for now. 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.110
 camera also worked perfectly 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.470
 for one year and four months 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.600
 We took several pictures and just did not 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.560
 you have an accident with her for the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.820
 test the resistance to fall from it but not 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.380
 okay right 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.930
 And I want to thank you, you too can 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.030
 help buy this camera that was going to have 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.550
 lasted quite a lot too so let's 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.739
 continue and make a video with her here 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.500
 the time she broke make another video 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.450
 for us to control over time 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.100
 all of life she had 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 so this is it, guys, thank you 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.500
 from this video until here and until the next 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.500
 video
