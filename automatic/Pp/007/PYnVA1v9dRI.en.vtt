 several Russian banks at once 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.430
 got into blocking perry release 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.779
 plastic cards are made from considerations 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.849
 security lately 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.679
 there are frequent fraud and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780
 hacker attacks who deals 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.759
 virtual theft and how yourself 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.050
 secure whether they will tell 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.130
 transfiguration what did you do here 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.050
 mall that did ask more 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.740
 cream 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.539
 presumably these are criminals 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 skimmers detained them at the moment when they 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 removed their equipment with an ATM 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.529
 after operatives examined to the car 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 here we have a place to be 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:39.960
 cards note they are blue 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.399
 they have the top 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.770
 the letter p of and some digital and four 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.239
 The numbers for the day in Moscow fix up to 70 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 similar crimes are alleged in 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.019
 Company information protection at the same time 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.059
 the maximum penalty for this is seven years 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.400
 prison and a fine of up to a million rubles for 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.230
 Russia such methods of fraud 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.659
 new all that is needed for skimming is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 here such devices devices puts in 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.350
 mainly of two components 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.259
 the task of the first component is to copy 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.840
 the magnetic stripe of your card is usually 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.610
 this device is put on 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.380
 card reader she comes in different designs 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.060
 under different ATM and here we see that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.780
 usually these are common greens 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.110
 ATMs 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 the second device is her video camera 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.210
 the task is copy ie write to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 video at the time of your finger input 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 pin code also place camcorders often 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 keyboard overlays are used 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 make or buy such equipment 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.190
 quite easy to say experts are worth 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 he is about 500 dollars to discover him during 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.729
 time is more difficult if the card is human 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.580
 compromised 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.289
 he most of the time about it will not 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.040
 know everything until the card is 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:53.670
 will withdraw money but there are cases when 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.790
 the service reserves the bank identifies overlays on 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.340
 ATMs and then they are analyzed 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.670
 information about those cards that have passed 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.869
 through this ATM in that period so far 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.950
 only mate was installed skimming and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.630
 equipment and they 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.210
 perry perk miss 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.280
 how cards case if criminals managed 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.170
 urgent withdraw money 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.600
 write a statement to the bank and the police 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.010
 then there is a chance to return the savings to 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.750
 skimming system as a rule 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.090
 a large group of people are involved 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.070
 whose duties are strictly divided 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 some make and install 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.030
 ATM pads with data in 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.590
 they are not stored but immediately using 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 built-in sim cards are transmitted 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.940
 accomplices in turn they either 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 sell card numbers pin codes either 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 instructs his accomplice to make 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.270
 new plastic cards and cash out 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
 while they are criminals may be 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.420
 in different countries 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.850
 that's why to discover and arrest 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.590
 they are difficult not to become a victim 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.300
 skimmers enough to observe a few 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.950
 safety rules for example not 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.780
 use an ATM in public places 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.850
 but if you scold this one 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360
 the machine is available , I first 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.370
 inspect 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.230
 for example slow card receivers and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.030
 keyboard specially read 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.459
 devices if such is not observed 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.110
 then you can get the card to shoot 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.090
 cash for some kind of civil 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.090
