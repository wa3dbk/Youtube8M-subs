just to show it off to people but you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.559 
just to show it off to people but you
know<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> greatest<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.390> said

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
know it's not the greatest like I said

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
know it's not the greatest like I said
it<00:02:09.720> does<00:02:09.869> handle<00:02:10.170> pretty<00:02:10.590> good<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
it does handle pretty good for what it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.120 
it does handle pretty good for what it
is

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.770 
is
and<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.670> pretty<00:02:12.820> fast<00:02:13.060> once<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.480> upgrade

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and it is pretty fast once you upgrade

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.410 
and it is pretty fast once you upgrade
it<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.650> again<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.610> like<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.300> said

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it for what it is again but like I said

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.810 
it for what it is again but like I said
if<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.530> don't<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> money<00:02:18.100> stay<00:02:18.670> away

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
if you don't have the money stay away

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.090 
if you don't have the money stay away
from<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.120> moving<00:02:19.810> into<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.080> second<00:02:20.410> car<00:02:20.590> this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
from it moving into the second car this

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.610 
from it moving into the second car this
one<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.330> most<00:02:22.600> expensive<00:02:23.020> out<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
one is the most expensive out of the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.020 
one is the most expensive out of the
update<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.230> LOM<00:02:26.230> patottie<00:02:27.030> Pigalle

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
update it is the LOM patottie Pigalle

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.970 
update it is the LOM patottie Pigalle
and<00:02:28.420> again<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.960> probably<00:02:29.200> said<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.530> wrong<00:02:29.800> I

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and again I probably said that wrong I

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.520 
and again I probably said that wrong I
don't<00:02:30.100> know<00:02:30.250> how<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.460> speak<00:02:31.180> whatever<00:02:31.600> that's

weird<00:02:38.920> off<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.400> bat<00:02:39.550> um<00:02:39.790> my<00:02:40.480> first<00:02:40.810> impression

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
weird off the bat um my first impression

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.040 
weird off the bat um my first impression
was<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.920> reminded<00:02:42.490> me<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.940> JB<00:02:43.330> 700

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
was that it reminded me of the JB 700

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.770 
was that it reminded me of the JB 700
but<00:02:44.560> kind<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.040> like<00:02:45.190> squinched<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.120> extended

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
but kind of like squinched and extended

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
but kind of like squinched and extended
a<00:02:46.840> little<00:02:46.870> bit<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> don't<00:02:47.380> know<00:02:47.470> maybe<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.710> was

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
a little bit I don't know maybe that was

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.710 
a little bit I don't know maybe that was

playing this morning the first thing he

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.290 
playing this morning the first thing he
said<00:02:53.110> who<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.310> kind<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.670> reminded<00:02:55.060> him

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
of the DeLorean from Back to the Future

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.740 
of the DeLorean from Back to the Future
which<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.760> thought<00:02:57.910> was<00:02:58.030> kind<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.330> funny<00:02:58.390> I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
which I thought was kind of funny I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.570 
which I thought was kind of funny I
guess<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.410> can<00:02:59.590> kind<00:02:59.860> of<00:02:59.980> see<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> resemblance

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
guess you can kind of see a resemblance

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.420 
guess you can kind of see a resemblance
in<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.420> but<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.650> one<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> most<00:03:03.280> expensive

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
in it but this one is the most expensive

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.520 
in it but this one is the most expensive
and<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:05.170> being<00:03:05.700> $400,000<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.940> website

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
and for being $400,000 on the website

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.660 
and for being $400,000 on the website
you<00:03:08.530> know<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.800> really<00:03:09.190> don't<00:03:09.310> know<00:03:09.460> if<00:03:09.580> it's

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
you know I really don't know if it's

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.700 
you know I really don't know if it's
worth<00:03:09.820> it<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.120> guess<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.450> really<00:03:10.990> depends<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.590> if

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
worth it I guess it really depends on if

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.710 
worth it I guess it really depends on if
you<00:03:11.830> have<00:03:11.860> enough<00:03:12.130> money<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.670> buy<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.450> or<00:03:13.600> not

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
you have enough money to buy it or not

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.930 
you have enough money to buy it or not
it<00:03:14.020> definitely<00:03:14.500> looks<00:03:14.710> really<00:03:15.310> unique<00:03:15.700> you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
it definitely looks really unique you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.520 
it definitely looks really unique you
know<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.090> don't<00:03:16.270> see<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.660> car<00:03:16.900> too<00:03:17.110> often

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.980 
know you don't see this car too often

as long as this one this one is a sports

as long as this one this one is a sports
classic<00:03:26.650> as<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.920> saw<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:27.280> went<00:03:27.490> into<00:03:27.670> LSC<00:03:28.450> and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
classic as you saw we went into LSC and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.800 
classic as you saw we went into LSC and
it's<00:03:29.560> got<00:03:29.740> some<00:03:29.920> really<00:03:30.100> interesting

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
it's got some really interesting

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.610 
it's got some really interesting
customization<00:03:31.810> options<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.230> can<00:03:32.350> add<00:03:32.410> this

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
customization options you can add this

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.520 
customization options you can add this
like<00:03:32.830> really<00:03:33.220> rusty<00:03:33.700> hood<00:03:33.970> which<00:03:34.750> obviously

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
like really rusty hood which obviously

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.260 
like really rusty hood which obviously
when<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:35.710> do<00:03:35.800> all<00:03:36.040> these<00:03:36.190> videos<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.670> make<00:03:36.850> my<00:03:37.030> car

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
when I do all these videos I make my car

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.150 
when I do all these videos I make my car
look<00:03:37.420> as<00:03:37.540> outrageous<00:03:38.020> as<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.440> possibly<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
look as outrageous as it possibly can

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.640 
look as outrageous as it possibly can
but<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.810> know<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:40.930> don't<00:03:41.200> really<00:03:41.290> know<00:03:41.440> if<00:03:41.560> I'm

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
but you know I don't really know if I'm

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.640 
but you know I don't really know if I'm
liking<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.460> hood<00:03:43.210> because<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:44.020> does<00:03:44.290> I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
liking that that hood because it does I

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.560 
liking that that hood because it does I
guess<00:03:45.220> if<00:03:45.400> you're<00:03:45.490> going<00:03:45.640> for<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.940> worn<00:03:46.360> down

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
guess if you're going for a worn down

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.900 
guess if you're going for a worn down
feel<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.260> would<00:03:47.500> look<00:03:47.620> cool<00:03:47.800> but<00:03:48.070> just<00:03:48.760> with

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
feel it would look cool but just with

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.370 
feel it would look cool but just with
the<00:03:48.940> whole<00:03:49.150> paint<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.900> other<00:03:50.020> paints

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
the whole paint and the other paints

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.720 
the whole paint and the other paints
that<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.860> put<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.370> doesn't<00:03:51.640> really

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
that you can put on it it doesn't really

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.640 
that you can put on it it doesn't really
match<00:03:52.000> too<00:03:52.300> well<00:03:52.450> maybe<00:03:53.080> if<00:03:53.230> they<00:03:53.350> had<00:03:53.380> that

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
match too well maybe if they had that

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.790 
match too well maybe if they had that
for<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.890> entire<00:03:54.340> body<00:03:55.000> or<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.840> entire<00:03:56.200> car<00:03:56.560> it

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
for the entire body or the entire car it

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.170 
for the entire body or the entire car it
would<00:03:56.920> look<00:03:57.040> cool<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.490> think<00:03:57.730> for<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.000> hood

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
would look cool but I think for the hood

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.810 
would look cool but I think for the hood
I<00:03:58.450> don't<00:03:58.960> really<00:03:59.080> like<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.380> as<00:03:59.500> much<00:03:59.700> one<00:04:00.700> other

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
I don't really like it as much one other

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.280 
I don't really like it as much one other
cool<00:04:01.180> thing<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.630> can<00:04:01.780> do<00:04:01.870> in<00:04:01.960> this<00:04:02.050> car

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
cool thing that you can do in this car

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.800 
cool thing that you can do in this car
is<00:04:02.440> put<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:03.190> ski<00:04:03.610> shoes<00:04:03.910> or<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.300> ski<00:04:04.570> I<00:04:04.600> don't

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
is put the ski shoes or the ski I don't

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.760 
is put the ski shoes or the ski I don't

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
know what they're exactly called but

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.680 
know what they're exactly called but

it's called the Alpine roof rack and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.660 
it's called the Alpine roof rack and
that<00:04:08.560> one's<00:04:08.710> definitely<00:04:09.160> really<00:04:09.370> cool<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.550> know

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
that one's definitely really cool I know

again
you<00:04:25.030> know<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.150> haven't<00:04:25.360> done<00:04:25.570> any<00:04:25.750> tests<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:26.170> I

you know I haven't done any tests so I

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.630 
you know I haven't done any tests so I
don't<00:04:26.350> know<00:04:26.410> if<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:26.620> like<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> fastest<00:04:27.340> in

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
don't know if it's like the fastest in

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.790 
don't know if it's like the fastest in
that<00:04:27.850> group<00:04:28.120> or<00:04:28.390> not<00:04:28.600> but<00:04:28.900> like<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.350> said<00:04:29.410> if<00:04:29.710> you

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
that group or not but like I said if you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.410 
that group or not but like I said if you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.690 
want to see that come back later and
they'll<00:04:32.410> definitely<00:04:32.620> be<00:04:33.280> on<00:04:33.520> my<00:04:33.550> channel

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
they'll definitely be on my channel

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.030 
they'll definitely be on my channel
either<00:04:34.270> today<00:04:34.570> or<00:04:34.600> tomorrow<00:04:34.780> but<00:04:35.440> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
either today or tomorrow but the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.710 
either today or tomorrow but the
handling<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.520> also<00:04:36.880> pretty<00:04:37.120> good<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.390> this<00:04:37.480> car

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
handling is also pretty good in this car

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.900 
handling is also pretty good in this car
and<00:04:38.140> I<00:04:38.560> would<00:04:38.710> say<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.040> one<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.520> best<00:04:39.700> out

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
and I would say it's one of the best out

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.670 
and I would say it's one of the best out
of<00:04:40.030> this<00:04:40.120> group<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.810> think<00:04:40.990> it's<00:04:41.080> seven<00:04:41.440> cars

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
of this group of I think it's seven cars

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.680 
of this group of I think it's seven cars
in<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:41.950> update<00:04:42.130> for<00:04:43.090> me<00:04:43.240> though<00:04:43.420> it's

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
in this update for me though it's

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.450 
in this update for me though it's
definitely<00:04:44.110> not<00:04:44.230> my<00:04:44.440> favorite<00:04:44.680> I'll<00:04:45.040> get<00:04:45.340> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
definitely not my favorite I'll get to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.970 
definitely not my favorite I'll get to
my<00:04:45.610> favorite<00:04:46.000> here<00:04:46.420> in<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.750> couple<00:04:46.930> videos<00:04:47.350> but

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
my favorite here in a couple videos but

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.740 
my favorite here in a couple videos but
I<00:04:48.250> can<00:04:48.610> definitely<00:04:48.910> see<00:04:49.060> how<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.240> lot<00:04:49.480> of<00:04:49.570> people

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
I can definitely see how a lot of people

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.720 
I can definitely see how a lot of people
will<00:04:49.930> like<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.290> car<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:51.130> only<00:04:51.280> problem<00:04:51.640> is

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
will like this car the only problem is

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.560 
will like this car the only problem is
again<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.620> $400,000<00:04:53.620> price<00:04:53.980> tag<00:04:54.250> but<00:04:54.880> if<00:04:55.120> you

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
again that $400,000 price tag but if you

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.910 
again that $400,000 price tag but if you
get<00:04:55.720> over<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.110> think<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.620> really<00:04:56.830> nice

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
get over that I think it's a really nice

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.400 
get over that I think it's a really nice
car<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.490> really<00:04:58.210> think<00:04:58.540> that<00:04:58.750> Rockstar<00:04:59.260> did<00:04:59.380> a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
car I really think that Rockstar did a

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.260 
car I really think that Rockstar did a
good<00:04:59.620> job<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.040> adding<00:05:00.370> different<00:05:01.000> cars

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
good job of adding different cars

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.300 
good job of adding different cars
instead<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:01.810> just<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.080> regular<00:05:02.110> old<00:05:02.620> super<00:05:03.040> and
