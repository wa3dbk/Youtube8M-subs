00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 the beautiful waves we are talking the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.379
 handkerchief why I came today without a handkerchief 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.830
 you came without a handkerchief 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.059
 advise perfect now if we are going to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.380
 talk then about how to put some 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.030
 inches is one has a handkerchief and you 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.210
 with you we do not put on the same 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.279
 way and some way there are many ways 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 and above all what I want to tell you and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.480
 that today the handkerchiefs have 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.760
 become an element or an accessory 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 essential for our day look 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.199
 a day and will depend on how the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.110
 use the colors that the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.780
 colorful pattern of prints and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.870
 the texture so that we see each other more 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 showy we do not see different then 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.960
 that's why we want a little 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.550
 accounting the different ways there 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.870
 to use it and the trends that there are 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.870
 for this fall 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.730
 Maria Moix and the one that employs different 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.979
 ways to use this this form is called 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.800
 turtle neck then what we do 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:04.559
 it's what we grab like that we do not have it anymore 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.850
 We grabbed one end of the handkerchief and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:15.189
 we take a turn then with the other side 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:19.960
 we give you a mooring here and now supervised 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:22.830
 arranging exact cute 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.830
 then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.900
 it's hot to cold what is a good 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.570
 handkerchief cuts the cold so this is how 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.670
 we tell the press why because 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.869
 it ends up being like a pretzel right now 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.800
 it teaches them if we grab it like this and not 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.800
 we had it and then one side we had 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 ahead the hole and then the other 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.630
 we passed it behind so you're me 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.920
 they spend the two together with more then 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 it looks like a braid 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.290
 in a proposed so I'm super of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.660
 Now speaking a little trend 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.700
 everything that is the mixture comes to us 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.630
 what does that mean that as we can 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.020
 see we have the 'animal print' we have 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.590
 butterflies 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.080
 in one handkerchief then as we 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.570
 we put this long handkerchief is half 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.590
 long light is as simple as this is not 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.430
 we passed 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.079
 we grab two little tips 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.079
 and we give him a playful 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.310
 and later 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.210
 we invest this and we spend our 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.470
 head out there 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.470
 and it's super good 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.480
 it is accommodated in a comfortable way not at 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 taste to the texture of the person 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.820
 also because you know that for the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 handkerchiefs if we do not put them more closed 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.070
 tighter we should have a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.020
 neck of being of thin build 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.850
 sportive for your neck that is short 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.010
 we have to use the loose 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.870
 this way it is more open is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.430
 super cute trends now and the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.250
 the variety of colorful handkerchiefs and 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.050
 combinations that there are like this is really 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.400
 we add with chando the Spaniards 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.680
 mind that it's a little good been 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.020
 accounting is about the trend for 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.540
 this winter the colors that are going to 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.540
 to predominate and without seeing the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.390
 flames of blue to 0 out there we have 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.510
 also some wines to see if they can 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.600
 show the color came and there we have the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.340
 green bottle that is fashionable 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:49.080
 we have also 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.489
 the animal prints almost in all fashion and 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.470
 talking a little about the prints 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.330
 we have print animal print for 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.080
 this winter we have prints too 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.290
 of floral print butterflies flowers 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.060
 big caihuasi I'm changing and I 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.950
 they have varied a lot for example I have 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.620
 still from the old ones of pressure of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.200
 Annecy silk and Europe has changed 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540
 much silk can be used more than 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.810
 nothing I believe with the same texture as 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.329
 I had silk like for the night 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.299
 that's how we have to 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.700
 are fats today the tendency to 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.100
 hunting is very fashionable so much for the day 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.210
 as for the night 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.570
 and how we combine handkerchiefs 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.160
 prints is complicated a little bit long 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.990
 now fashion 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.080
 good just what maria jose said 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.150
 that what is used is a mixture of 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.000
 prints if you see look I have a 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.070
 stamped on my pants and my handkerchief is 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.990
 another pattern no problem there is no 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.090
 problem the thing is that the colors 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.669
 but we do not have to have the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.650
 exact or similar stamping the thing is 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.020
 break today with a third element 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.409
 which can be a third color a third 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.409
 like the shoes 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.389
 I hope the next one comes with more 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.960
 things we do not have their defined oils 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.240
 transact 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.090
 and I love it and of and good to thank you 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.550

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.550
 has taught but I will watch the video 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.939
 and that we have brought a summary nothing 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:37.490
 more to make a presentation by 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:41.600
 example with the two tips 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:49.450

 i 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.680
