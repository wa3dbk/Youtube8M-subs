mention before I go on the drive is off

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.650 
mention before I go on the drive is off
you<00:00:48.450> might<00:00:48.660> hear<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.379> front<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:49.860> strut

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
you might hear the front right strut

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
you might hear the front right strut
rattling<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.870> maybe<00:00:52.280> clunking<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> bit<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
rattling or maybe clunking a bit when I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
rattling or maybe clunking a bit when I
hit<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> brakes<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.559> main<00:00:55.739> thing<00:00:55.980> you'll

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
hit the brakes but the main thing you'll

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.029 
hit the brakes but the main thing you'll
probably<00:00:56.340> hear<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.329> rattle<00:00:57.840> noise<00:00:58.039> that's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
probably hear is a rattle noise that's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.689 
probably hear is a rattle noise that's
it's<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.239> significant<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.699> what's

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it's pretty significant but what's

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's pretty significant but what's
happening<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> transfer<00:01:04.830> case<00:01:05.040> blew

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
happening is when the transfer case blew

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
happening is when the transfer case blew
up<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.450> drive<00:01:06.840> shaft<00:01:07.140> came<00:01:07.409> apart<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> hit

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
up the drive shaft came apart and it hit

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
up the drive shaft came apart and it hit
the<00:01:08.369> exhaust<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.750> bent<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> exhaust

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the exhaust and it bent the exhaust

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
the exhaust and it bent the exhaust
piping<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.659> hitting<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> car

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
piping and then it was hitting the car

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.920 
piping and then it was hitting the car
right<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> transmission<00:01:14.970> tunnel<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
right in the transmission tunnel and I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
right in the transmission tunnel and I
tried<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> bend<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> back<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> bent<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
tried to bend it back and when I bent it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
tried to bend it back and when I bent it
back<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> didn't<00:01:19.470> hit<00:01:19.560> there

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
back a little bit it didn't hit there

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.399 
back a little bit it didn't hit there
but<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> hits<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.640> subframe<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but it hits the subframe in the back of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.249 
but it hits the subframe in the back of
a<00:01:22.470> car<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> turn<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.259> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a car when you when you turn right it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.969 
a car when you when you turn right it
hits<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> subframe

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
hits the subframe

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.050 
hits the subframe
and<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:28.210> really<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.659> only<00:01:28.689> thing<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:30.060> can

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
and that's really the only thing I can

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.880 
and that's really the only thing I can
think<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.420> right<00:01:31.720> at<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.259> moment<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
think of right at the moment then it's

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.359 
think of right at the moment then it's
got<00:01:36.100> power<00:01:36.340> steering<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.939> all<00:01:37.090> works<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:39.220> go

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
got power steering it all works then go

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:52.149 
got power steering it all works then go
for<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.670> drive

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.679 

I<00:01:52.249> don't<00:01:52.909> know<00:01:52.969> if<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.179> can<00:01:53.359> hear<00:01:53.570> the

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
I don't know if you can hear the

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.929 
I don't know if you can hear the
clanking<00:01:54.319> in<00:01:54.499> the<00:01:54.619> back<00:01:54.829> that's<00:01:55.609> what<00:01:55.789> the

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
clanking in the back that's what the

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:33.080 
clanking in the back that's what the
exhaust<00:01:56.299> is

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.320 

all<00:02:33.630> right<00:02:33.840> well<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:35.160> car<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.640> drive<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
all right well the car will drive and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.770 
all right well the car will drive and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
cruise all right you can see I got a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.510 
cruise all right you can see I got a
little<00:02:40.020> bit<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.349> fluctuation<00:02:40.590> from<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
little bit of fluctuation from the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.750 
little bit of fluctuation from the
speedometer<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.959> speed<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.760> cable

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
speedometer it's just the speed on cable

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.540 
speedometer it's just the speed on cable
driven<00:02:44.940> speedometer<00:02:45.720> doing<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:47.099> no<00:02:47.340> big

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
driven speedometer doing that is no big

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.500 
driven speedometer doing that is no big
deal

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.240 

I'll<00:02:51.510> take<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> left<00:02:52.260> into<00:02:52.620> here

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.530 

now

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
now

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.660 
now
you<00:02:58.379> might<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:58.739> able<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.010> hear<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> mean

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you might be able to hear what I mean

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.459 
you might be able to hear what I mean
with<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.000> turbo<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.140> kind<00:03:01.379> of

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
with the turbo go and now it's kind of

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.709 
with the turbo go and now it's kind of
making<00:03:01.680> some<00:03:01.980> noise<00:03:02.219> it's<00:03:03.000> still<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.569> still

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
making some noise it's still it still

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.740 
making some noise it's still it still
builds<00:03:04.230> pressure<00:03:04.379> properly<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:06.239> it's<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.569> a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
builds pressure properly but it's just a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.580 
builds pressure properly but it's just a
little<00:03:06.989> bit<00:03:07.109> louder<00:03:07.379> than<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:08.640> used<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:08.939> be<00:03:09.590> but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
little bit louder than it used to be but

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.200 
little bit louder than it used to be but
the<00:03:10.739> car<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.069> pretty<00:03:11.250> quick

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.330 

I<00:03:19.060> was<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.410> second<00:03:21.410> year<00:03:21.590> pool<00:03:21.860> there<00:03:22.130> I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
I was just a second year pool there I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.070 
I was just a second year pool there I
don't<00:03:22.730> want<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.060> too<00:03:23.270> much<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:23.810> I'm

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
don't want to do too much because I'm

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.920 
don't want to do too much because I'm
kind<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.770> driving<00:03:25.190> with<00:03:25.310> one<00:03:25.430> hand<00:03:25.520> right<00:03:25.970> now

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.480 

yeah<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.110> car<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.410> actually<00:03:30.590> because<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
yeah the car is actually because of the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.670 
yeah the car is actually because of the
boost<00:03:31.700> controller<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.450> running<00:03:33.080> at<00:03:33.200> 16

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
boost controller it's running at 16

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.630 
boost controller it's running at 16
pounds<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.190> boost<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:36.500> right<00:03:36.710> racing<00:03:37.190> ECU

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
pounds of boost and the right racing ECU

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.170 
pounds of boost and the right racing ECU
is<00:03:37.790> supposed<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.180> be<00:03:38.360> tuned<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:40.640> work<00:03:40.820> properly

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
is supposed to be tuned to work properly

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.640 
is supposed to be tuned to work properly
at<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.810> psi<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:43.750> seems<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.870> work<00:03:45.140> alright

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
at that psi and seems to work alright

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.710 
at that psi and seems to work alright
the<00:03:46.190> only<00:03:46.250> problem<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:46.940> with<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.300> turbo

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the only problem is with the turbo

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.830 
the only problem is with the turbo
acting<00:03:48.170> up<00:03:48.350> like<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.710> said<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.040> was<00:03:49.840> sometimes

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
acting up like I said it was sometimes

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.950 
acting up like I said it was sometimes
it<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.500> won't<00:03:51.790> won't<00:03:52.790> build<00:03:53.030> as<00:03:53.210> much<00:03:53.420> boost<00:03:53.690> as

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
it it won't won't build as much boost as

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.470 
it it won't won't build as much boost as
it<00:03:54.110> should<00:03:54.490> and<00:03:55.490> I<00:03:55.610> thought<00:03:55.820> it<00:03:55.970> was<00:03:56.060> maybe<00:03:56.300> a

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
it should and I thought it was maybe a

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.210 
it should and I thought it was maybe a
boost<00:03:56.780> week<00:03:57.110> but<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.440> haven't<00:03:57.650> been<00:03:57.890> able<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
boost week but I haven't been able to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.070 
boost week but I haven't been able to
find<00:03:58.490> one<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.120> seems<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.450> pull<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> same

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
find one and it seems to pull the same

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.300 
find one and it seems to pull the same
amount<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.500> vacuum<00:04:00.710> as<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.220> did<00:04:01.370> before

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.470 

and<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.490> guess

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
and I guess

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.240 
and I guess
I<00:04:07.569> guess<00:04:08.170> that's<00:04:08.440> all<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.650> really<00:04:09.010> got<00:04:09.190> and
