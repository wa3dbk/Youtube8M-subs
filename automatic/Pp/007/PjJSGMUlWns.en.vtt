00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.570 
all those pieces and then of course all
the<00:02:12.569> other<00:02:12.599> pieces<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.260> what

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
the other pieces is what

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.180 
the other pieces is what
are<00:02:14.240> down<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.750> there<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.770> there's<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.010> few

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
are down in there and then there's a few

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.990 
are down in there and then there's a few
other<00:02:16.250> extra<00:02:16.880> pieces<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:19.160> as<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.550> can<00:02:19.730> see

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
other extra pieces but as you can see

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.710 
other extra pieces but as you can see
everything<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:20.980> excellent<00:02:21.980> molding<00:02:22.720> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
everything is just excellent molding and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.450 
everything is just excellent molding and
so<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.320> think<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:24.890> going<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.160> turn<00:02:25.250> out<00:02:25.430> to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
so I think this is going to turn out to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.430 
so I think this is going to turn out to
be<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> really<00:02:26.270> nice<00:02:26.540> kit<00:02:26.870> when<00:02:27.020> I'm<00:02:27.140> finished

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
be a really nice kit when I'm finished

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.560 
be a really nice kit when I'm finished
with<00:02:27.500> it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
with it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.470 
with it
but<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.600> do<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.170> few<00:02:30.530> little<00:02:31.280> plans<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.300> it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
but I do have a few little plans for it

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
I'm going to do it is gonna be a lot of

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.780 
I'm going to do it is gonna be a lot of
other<00:03:00.320> customization<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.610> go

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
other customization it's going to go

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.280 
other customization it's going to go
into<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:05.420> will<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.930> know<00:03:05.960> look

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
into this and so it will you know look

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.500 
into this and so it will you know look
not<00:03:07.280> totally<00:03:07.700> different<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.300> little

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
not totally different but a little

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.590 
not totally different but a little
different<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:09.530> I'm<00:03:09.680> done<00:03:09.830> with<00:03:10.010> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
different when I'm done with it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.770 
different when I'm done with it
but<00:03:11.600> first<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.990> all<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.260> can<00:03:12.440> see<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.300> have

Wills<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.260> will<00:03:30.530> be<00:03:30.680> using

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.010 

a<00:03:33.000> set<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.340> Pegasus<00:03:35.340> wills<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.480> had<00:03:36.720> painted

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
a set of Pegasus wills now I had painted

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.580 
a set of Pegasus wills now I had painted
these<00:03:37.230> black<00:03:37.620> already<00:03:37.980> with<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.700> red<00:03:39.030> trim

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590

these black already with that red trim
I'll<00:03:40.590> probably<00:03:40.920> be<00:03:41.100> taking<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.550> red<00:03:41.760> trim<00:03:42.030> off

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
I'll probably be taking the red trim off

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.260 
I'll probably be taking the red trim off
of<00:03:42.450> them<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.960> they'll<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.310> solid<00:03:45.090> black

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.520 
of them and they'll just be solid black
for<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.960> build

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
for this build

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.440 
for this build
I<00:03:46.560> really<00:03:47.430> haven't<00:03:47.550> picked<00:03:47.760> out<00:03:47.910> any<00:03:48.090> colors

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
I really haven't picked out any colors

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.900 
I really haven't picked out any colors
yet<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.280> I'm<00:03:50.430> not<00:03:50.580> too<00:03:50.850> sure<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.240> that<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:52.910> I'm

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
yet so I'm not too sure on that but I'm

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.190 
yet so I'm not too sure on that but I'm
gonna<00:03:54.120> be<00:03:54.270> doing<00:03:54.450> something<00:03:54.780> cool<00:03:54.930> with<00:03:55.110> the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
gonna be doing something cool with the

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.890 
gonna be doing something cool with the
paint<00:03:55.440> job<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.040> mean<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:57.000> once<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.480> pick<00:03:57.660> up<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
paint job I mean so once I pick up the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.360 
paint job I mean so once I pick up the
colors<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.530> I'll<00:03:58.650> know<00:03:58.830> what<00:03:59.040> I'm<00:03:59.130> gonna<00:03:59.280> be

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
colors and I'll know what I'm gonna be

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.420 
colors and I'll know what I'm gonna be
doing<00:03:59.910> exactly<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:02.070> then<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.400> course

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
doing exactly on that and then of course

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.280 
doing exactly on that and then of course
if<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.870> look<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:05.040> engine<00:04:05.400> bay<00:04:05.550> there<00:04:06.290> you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
if you look in the engine bay there you

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.380 
if you look in the engine bay there you
can<00:04:07.470> see<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.250> not<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:09.090> stock<00:04:10.100> 427

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
can see that that is not the stock 427

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.290 
can see that that is not the stock 427
that<00:04:12.390> would<00:04:12.600> go<00:04:12.810> inside<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.500> car<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:15.060> is

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
that would go inside of this car that is

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.850 
that would go inside of this car that is
actually<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.200> motor<00:04:16.730> from<00:04:18.769> this<00:04:19.769> kit<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.519> o7

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
actually the motor from this kit the o7

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.830 
actually the motor from this kit the o7
Shelby<00:04:22.860> gt500<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:26.010> wanted<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.060> make<00:04:27.660> this

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
Shelby gt500 and I wanted to make this
