there's<00:01:24.270> any<00:01:24.439> any<00:01:25.439> disagreement<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
there's any any disagreement that this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.120 
there's any any disagreement that this
is<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> matter<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.150> needs<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.720> resolved

is a matter that needs to be resolved

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.080 
is a matter that needs to be resolved
that<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.250> unthinkable<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.880> these

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that it's unthinkable that these

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
that it's unthinkable that these
benefits<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.960> available<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
benefits would not be available and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.170 
benefits would not be available and
therefore<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.490> he's<00:01:32.850> doing<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> right

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
therefore were he's doing the right

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.330 
therefore were he's doing the right
thing<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.720> commander-in-chief<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.100> making

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
thing as commander-in-chief and making

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.710 
thing as commander-in-chief and making
sure<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.729> resolved<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.689> I

understand<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.950> there's<00:01:38.369> discretion

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
understand is there there's discretion

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
understand is there there's discretion
clearly<00:01:39.479> into<00:01:39.860> deciding<00:01:40.860> who<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.250> essential

expect<00:02:13.740> one<00:02:13.920> today<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.400> think<00:02:14.790> that's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
expect one today I think that's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.030

yesterday that again i think i've just
