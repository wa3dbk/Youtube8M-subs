00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
platonic or romantic you know it's not
worth<00:01:41.130> doing<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.759> yourself<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> you're<00:01:43.290> not

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
worth doing to yourself and you're not

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.370 
worth doing to yourself and you're not
alone<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.399> you're<00:01:44.520> dealing<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
alone with what you're dealing with and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.179 
alone with what you're dealing with and
if<00:01:46.380> something's<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.220> healthy<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
if something's not healthy for you it's

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.920 
if something's not healthy for you it's
not<00:01:50.189> worth<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:51.570> did<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
not worth it where did you get the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.190 
not worth it where did you get the
inspiration<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:54.200> it's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
inspiration for that from like it's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.420 
inspiration for that from like it's
mostly<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.799> collection<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.280> observations

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
mostly just a collection of observations

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.209 
mostly just a collection of observations
I've<00:01:57.060> made<00:01:57.240> throughout<00:01:57.600> living<00:01:58.170> life<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.770> mean

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I've made throughout living life I mean

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
I've made throughout living life I mean
my<00:01:59.399> parents<00:01:59.790> had<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> very<00:02:00.780> terrible

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
my parents had a very terrible

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
my parents had a very terrible
relationship<00:02:01.920> I've<00:02:02.189> been<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.579> some<00:02:02.759> bad

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
relationship I've been in some bad

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.270 
relationship I've been in some bad
relationships<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> pretty<00:02:05.070> good

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
relationships and now in a pretty good

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.300 
relationships and now in a pretty good
one<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:06.299> happy<00:02:06.540> about<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.259> um<00:02:07.469> it's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
one so I'm happy about that but um it's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.199 
one so I'm happy about that but um it's
it's

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
it's

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's
it's<00:02:09.539> an<00:02:09.689> exaggeration<00:02:10.019> of<00:02:10.890> real-life

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's an exaggeration of real-life

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.140 
it's an exaggeration of real-life
observations<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.709> when<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.069> get<00:02:14.250> inside<00:02:14.700> each

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
observations so when you get inside each

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.259 
observations so when you get inside each
individual<00:02:15.750> track<00:02:16.640> how<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.849> kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> find

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
individual track how do you kind of find

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.759 
individual track how do you kind of find
the<00:02:18.390> inspiration<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:18.930> those<00:02:19.019> specific<00:02:19.230> ones

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
the inspiration for those specific ones

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.099 
the inspiration for those specific ones
I<00:02:19.980> mean<00:02:20.129> tying<00:02:20.640> back<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.150> theme<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.689> is

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
I mean tying back to that theme is is

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.229 
I mean tying back to that theme is is
pretty<00:02:22.469> easy<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.370> broad<00:02:23.609> but<00:02:23.849> each

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
pretty easy because it's broad but each

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.660 
pretty easy because it's broad but each
individual<00:02:24.750> track<00:02:25.019> how<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.379> kind<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.889> get

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
individual track how do you kind of get

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.899 
individual track how do you kind of get
that<00:02:26.819> specific<00:02:27.239> inspiration<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.579> mean<00:02:29.579> as<00:02:29.849> the

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
that specific inspiration I mean as the

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.390 
that specific inspiration I mean as the
city<00:02:30.329> goes<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:30.930> supposed<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.319> intensify<00:02:31.950> as

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
city goes it's supposed to intensify as

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.330 
city goes it's supposed to intensify as
each<00:02:32.760> song<00:02:33.030> progresses<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:35.159> know<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
each song progresses so you know it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.390 
each song progresses so you know it
starts<00:02:35.639> out<00:02:35.760> kind<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.239> more<00:02:36.450> relaxed<00:02:37.109> and<00:02:37.260> more

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
starts out kind of more relaxed and more

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
starts out kind of more relaxed and more
angry<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.209> each<00:02:40.019> track<00:02:40.469> kind<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.799> goes

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
angry and then each track kind of goes

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.259 
angry and then each track kind of goes
into<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> different<00:02:41.340> emotion<00:02:41.879> that's<00:02:42.000> felt

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
into a different emotion that's felt

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.860 
into a different emotion that's felt
when<00:02:42.510> you're<00:02:42.659> experiencing<00:02:43.620> unrefuted<00:02:44.220> love
