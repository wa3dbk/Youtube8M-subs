hi<00:00:08.670> she<00:00:09.390> studies<00:00:09.720> fit<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.349> lot<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.040> science<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
hi she studies fit a lot of science is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.600 
hi she studies fit a lot of science is
done<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.720> high-tech<00:00:13.260> equipment<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.340> use

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
done with high-tech equipment but I use

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.980 
done with high-tech equipment but I use
the<00:00:15.210> simple<00:00:16.170> method<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.740> pencil<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> paper<00:00:17.550> I

go underwater pick a fish time it for
three<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> half<00:00:21.930> minutes<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.789> tally<00:00:23.840> what

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
three and a half minutes and tally what

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.230 
three and a half minutes and tally what
it's<00:00:24.960> eating<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.890> many<00:00:26.100> times<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.609> study

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
it's eating and how many times I study

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.380 
it's eating and how many times I study
or<00:00:27.660> vigorous<00:00:28.109> fish<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:29.100> eat<00:00:29.130> marine<00:00:30.000> clamp

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
or vigorous fish they eat marine clamp

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.680 
or vigorous fish they eat marine clamp
for<00:00:30.869> marine<00:00:31.230> algae<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.609> at<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.089> rate<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
for marine algae I look at the rate the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
for marine algae I look at the rate the
speed<00:00:33.839> basically<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.889> how<00:00:35.069> often<00:00:35.339> they<00:00:35.879> eat

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
speed basically and how often they eat

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.419 
speed basically and how often they eat
algae<00:00:36.479> off<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.229> the<00:00:37.379> reef<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.010> does<00:00:38.159> that<00:00:38.190> make

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
algae off of the reef so does that make

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.750 
algae off of the reef so does that make
you<00:00:38.609> a<00:00:38.639> fish<00:00:38.999> dietitian<00:00:39.659> sort<00:00:40.229> of<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.799> have<00:00:41.460> seen

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you a fish dietitian sort of I have seen

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.899 
you a fish dietitian sort of I have seen
that<00:00:42.179> they<00:00:42.620> overwhelmingly<00:00:43.620> love<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.609> certain

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
that they overwhelmingly love a certain

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.669 
that they overwhelmingly love a certain
kind<00:00:45.179> of<00:00:45.269> algae<00:00:45.539> turf<00:00:45.780> algae<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.319> like<00:00:46.440> baby

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
kind of algae turf algae it's like baby

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.579 
kind of algae turf algae it's like baby
algae<00:00:47.159> that<00:00:47.519> grows<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.209> everything<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.229> some

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
algae that grows on everything but some

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.009 
algae that grows on everything but some
reefs<00:00:49.889> have<00:00:50.249> more<00:00:50.850> turf<00:00:51.420> algae<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.869> more

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
reefs have more turf algae and more

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.049 
reefs have more turf algae and more
algae<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.739> other<00:00:52.949> rings<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.579> looking<00:00:53.940> at

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
algae than other rings I'm looking at

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.419 
algae than other rings I'm looking at
whether<00:00:54.329> these<00:00:54.929> fish<00:00:55.319> eat<00:00:55.709> more<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.159> at

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
whether these fish eat more of it at

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.419 
whether these fish eat more of it at
faster<00:00:56.999> speeds<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.869> reefs<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.679> have<00:00:58.979> a<00:00:59.010> lot

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
faster speeds at reefs that have a lot

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.699 
faster speeds at reefs that have a lot
of<00:00:59.459> LG<00:00:59.969> vs.<00:01:00.510> reefs<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.929> don't<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.409> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.619> of

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:01.709 
of LG vs. reefs that don't have a lot of

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:04.160 
of LG vs. reefs that don't have a lot of
algae<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.609> why<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.089> research<00:01:03.359> important

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
algae so why is this research important

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
algae so why is this research important
so<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.859> the<00:01:05.100> fish<00:01:05.460> eats<00:01:06.119> algae<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.350> algae

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so if the fish eats algae and the algae

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.670 
so if the fish eats algae and the algae
is<00:01:08.009> taken<00:01:08.369> off<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.119> gives<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:10.049> time<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
is taken off that gives more time and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
is taken off that gives more time and
more<00:01:10.859> space<00:01:11.219> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.579> coral<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> grow<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
more space for the coral to grow and you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.749 
more space for the coral to grow and you
go<00:01:13.079> out<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> reef<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.609> these

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
go out to a reef you want to see these

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.029 
go out to a reef you want to see these
beautiful<00:01:15.000> corals<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.810> living<00:01:16.109> and<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
beautiful corals that are living and it

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.520 
beautiful corals that are living and it
gives<00:01:17.299> more<00:01:18.299> diversity<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> reef

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
gives more diversity of the reef

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
gives more diversity of the reef
especially<00:01:20.219> for<00:01:20.369> other<00:01:20.549> organisms<00:01:21.179> as<00:01:21.450> well

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
especially for other organisms as well

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480 
especially for other organisms as well
and<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.140> fish<00:01:22.469> are<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:22.859> important

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and so these fish are really important

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330 
and so these fish are really important
to<00:01:24.060> remove<00:01:24.390> all<00:01:24.689> these<00:01:24.810> plants<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.740> at

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to remove all these plants that are at

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.999 
to remove all these plants that are at
some<00:01:26.609> of<00:01:26.729> these<00:01:26.789> reefs<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> taking<00:01:27.659> over

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
some of these reefs kind of taking over

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.709 
some of these reefs kind of taking over
my<00:01:29.009> whole<00:01:29.219> time<00:01:29.429> being<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.060> we've<00:01:30.450> watched

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
my whole time being here we've watched

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.319 
my whole time being here we've watched
over<00:01:31.939> 2,400<00:01:32.939> fish<00:01:34.070> 2,400<00:01:35.070> finished<00:01:35.549> job<00:01:35.759> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
over 2,400 fish 2,400 finished job it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.819 
over 2,400 fish 2,400 finished job it's
a<00:01:36.390> long<00:01:36.539> time<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> three<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a long time and you do a three and a

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
a long time and you do a three and a
half<00:01:37.950> minutes<00:01:38.310> each<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.820> three<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> half

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
half minutes each so three and a half

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.880 
half minutes each so three and a half
minutes<00:01:39.810> eat<00:01:39.899> what<00:01:40.109> is<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> our

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
minutes eat what is that like to our

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.029 
minutes eat what is that like to our
dive<00:01:41.219> six<00:01:42.149> solid<00:01:42.509> days<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> stalking<00:01:43.560> fish

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
dive six solid days of stalking fish

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.770 
dive six solid days of stalking fish
pretty<00:01:45.030> much<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.659> mean<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> fish<00:01:47.159> stalker

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
pretty much I mean I'm a fish stalker

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
pretty much I mean I'm a fish stalker
they<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.960> notice<00:01:49.109> that<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.499> there<00:01:49.679> they

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
they don't notice that you're there they

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.429 
they don't notice that you're there they
notice<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.329> you're<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:51.719> you<00:01:52.170> kind<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
notice that you're there you kind of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.529 
notice that you're there you kind of
keep<00:01:52.649> your<00:01:52.799> distance<00:01:52.999> there<00:01:53.999> are<00:01:54.149> times<00:01:54.420> when

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
keep your distance there are times when

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.450 
keep your distance there are times when
they<00:01:54.630> try<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> swim<00:01:55.530> away<00:01:55.619> from<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> hide

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
they try to swim away from you or a hide
