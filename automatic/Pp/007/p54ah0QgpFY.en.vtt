okay lowest heat setting that's gonna do
that<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> -<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.820> that's<00:02:15.150> what<00:02:15.300> we

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
that as a - then I think that's what we

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.680 
that as a - then I think that's what we
did<00:02:15.480> before<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.420> here<00:02:18.660> we

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
did before and then that's it so here we

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.610 
did before and then that's it so here we
go<00:02:18.780> let's<00:02:19.020> start<00:02:19.440> those<00:02:21.410> hopefully<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:22.500> get

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
go let's start those hopefully we get

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.360 
go let's start those hopefully we get
some<00:02:22.830> nice<00:02:23.580> warm<00:02:24.030> toasty<00:02:25.280> pop-tarts<00:02:26.280> now

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
some nice warm toasty pop-tarts now

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190
