feeling on the back of it and on the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.860 
feeling on the back of it and on the
inside<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:47.310> know<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.460> mean<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.690> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
inside and you know I mean this is a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.380 
inside and you know I mean this is a
really<00:02:49.140> good<00:02:49.590> case<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.250> mean<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.150> want<00:02:51.360> a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
really good case I mean if you want a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.420 
really good case I mean if you want a
case<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.870> looks<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.290> noble<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.280> they

case it looks like noble one that they
brought<00:02:53.670> out<00:02:53.730> but<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.540> want<00:02:54.780> one<00:02:54.960> that's<00:02:55.110> less

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
brought out but you want one that's less
