may<00:02:26.560> seem<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.100> video<00:02:27.430> was<00:02:27.700> kind<00:02:27.970> of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
may seem like the video was kind of

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.000 
may seem like the video was kind of
laggy<00:02:28.330> right<00:02:28.810> now<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:29.500> that's<00:02:29.710> just<00:02:29.860> how

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
laggy right now but that's just how

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.820 
laggy right now but that's just how
can't<00:02:30.310> Asia<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.940> by<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.900> recording<00:02:32.470> or<00:02:32.620> not

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
can't Asia is by the recording or not

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.670 
can't Asia is by the recording or not
when<00:02:33.490> playing<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> video<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.350> say<00:02:35.470> no

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
when playing the video so just say no

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.760 
when playing the video so just say no
it's<00:02:35.890> not<00:02:36.070> laggy<00:02:36.490> right<00:02:36.640> then<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:38.470> keep

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it's not laggy right then just keep

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.680 
it's not laggy right then just keep
doing<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.760> course<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.390> you're<00:02:40.540> probably

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
doing this of course and you're probably

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.540 
doing this of course and you're probably
gonna<00:02:40.960> do<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.140> parody<00:02:41.410> or<00:02:41.650> something<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.310> just

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
