00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everybody is the dari and today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.350
 we will go to see a very argument 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.690
 very nice that is causing a stir 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.349
 throughout the clash of community 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.110
 france 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.580
 it is yes guys of the cloud that is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 of clan wars 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.949
 will be a truly epic update e 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 will arrive more or less towards Wednesday 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.590
 numbers with sally and that is 9 anyway between 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 a few days before going to talk 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 I wanted a moment of this update 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.780
 just tell you that the Jews you brought back in 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 background some are my attacks 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.670
 some facts from the clans 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.649
 I'll put them there for a while, ciro e 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.559
 anyway we go immediately to talk about 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 these clouds as the word itself says 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.460
 there are clan wars in fact there 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.850
 will be two rival clans that yes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 clan wars will clash 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.469
 will last two days and there are some 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.280
 things to say then the clan first 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.820
 enemy can be there is true chosen in 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.830
 according to various statistics in fact to the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100
 troop level hero levels 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.750
 at the level at the base level 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 especially at the level of the walls and also 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.240
 enlargement to the level of the muncipio e 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.130
 the interesting thing is that for the choice 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 the other clans will not count trophies 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.220
 and to choose the other clan 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.130
 obviously it will be enough to start the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.439
 war between a clan or a chief 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.229
 will have to go to the button that will be in 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.510
 bottom left of the clan war 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.240
 to choose war begins e 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.720
 a clan will be raffled based on 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.490
 these features there must be said before 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.830
 so a very interesting thing 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.460
 because it will be much more balanced with 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.460
 this system 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.840
 I said before that wars between which 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.740
 the time in the evening had to be two days from 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 when the opposing clan will be found 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.020
 and there will be two days will be well 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.140
 distinct indeed the first day will be a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.170
 day of preparation precede 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.510
 which you will have to change village by putting 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.300
 obviously the town hall inside and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.860
 the other opponents will troop tomorrow 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.420
 also set the traps for those things 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.450
 there finished 3 for 24 hours of the day 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.390
 you will not be able to change in preparation 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.220
 village and return troops and day 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.840
 then the real one will start 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.510
 fighting between clans and cities 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.950
 will always be placed on the map that 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.260
 You find the proceeds to button 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.000
 sinister mass of clan and wars 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.600
 will be arranged in order 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 I believe from the weakest and strongest 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.470
 each of the clans can attack a base 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.590
 of the barns of the habit and will have a 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.920
 then two attacks available 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.720
 exploit level and the goal will be 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.640
 make as many stars as possible to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.360
 end of the clan from the end of 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:18.209
 conflict you will win the clan you will have 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.459
 got more resources what you need 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.330
 for itself clan wars are needed 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.940
 yes for fun but there will also be a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.230
 nice booty for the winners 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.190
 in fact when you attack you will win 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.900
 a battle you will have a loot but in 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.890
 theory that loot will not come 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:44.010
 to you but will be added hong kong sel ei 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:47.370
 clan and the winning clan will get the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.840
 split booty in the three clan members 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.859
 I still don't know how it will be shared 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.269
 we'll see so much we wait is another thing 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.489
 the update will be very interesting 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.420
 of the castellar clan at level 6 that how 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.920
 to be able to hold therefore 35 places and the thing 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.230
 very beautiful in my opinion than the one a 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.150
 level 5 scale ie in cost less 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.730
 and therefore I will probably do it and this 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.180
 case the clan will have a new function 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.250
 in fact it will be used as a bank for the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.889
 resources and for trophies 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.539
 I think it was maybe just for resources 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.330
 I'm still not very sure about this 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.930
 and in any case you can deposit it in his 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.849
 internal of the resources you have obtained 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.289
 without therefore losing the veil during the clubs 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:38.099
 horse is another thing on which indeed 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:41.130
 in clan warfare if not not 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.840
 penalize the game and the trophy 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.940
 Violent do not count as I have 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.620
 said before because you will have a village 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.300
 that of the day of preparation for the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.289
 war between clans and your village 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.610
 normal that will be for a period like now 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.650
 of criscio plus so you can 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.560
 quietly continue to do the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:08.250
 Your and nothing another pasture 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.310
 lines below I will put the link 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.199
 of the crash forum page 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.210
 class where he explained everything very well 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.620
 perhaps better than what I said 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.370
 so if you have not understood what 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.260
 go find it and english so not 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.539
 however, we understand a lot anyway 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.909
 translate you can understand something 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.330
 even if there are traditions 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.919
 truly bizarre is another thing 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.349
 I wanted to tell you is this update 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.860
 was chosen based on a survey 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:41.810
 in the forum in fact I believe that 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.630
 the Armenians of the forum have written if 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.610
 choose between clan warfare or others 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.729
 upgrade I won't make a new one 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.940
 hero or update of the Valkyries 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.979
 obviously the clan war has had 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.440
 many many many more votes than 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.340
 others and so this will be the new one 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.910
 updating 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.970
 so if anything it was not 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.949
 clear and I think it's very likely 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.419
 comment that I will answer I searched 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.639
 to inform me as much as possible but 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.160
 however it is hard because Italian sources 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.259
 there are none so I have to go and do 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.050
 the treasure hunt to catch every 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.490
 information so I hope that 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.009
 appreciate the commitment let me like it 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.030
 subscribe to the channel hello everyone at 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.030
