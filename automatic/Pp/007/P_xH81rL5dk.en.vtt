the<00:00:02.939> side<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.540> YouTube<00:00:03.780> I'd<00:00:04.259> go<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.799> shots

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
the side of YouTube I'd go for shots

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
that you don't typically see in things

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.150 
that you don't typically see in things
that<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:06.960> just<00:00:07.049> quirky<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.680> nature<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.130> I

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
that are just quirky in nature that I

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.520 
that are just quirky in nature that I
find<00:00:08.550> very<00:00:08.639> interesting<00:00:09.330> now<00:00:10.019> being<00:00:10.230> able<00:00:10.410> to

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
find very interesting now being able to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.589 
find very interesting now being able to
captivate<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.160> moment<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.639> DSLR<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.330> quite

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
captivate that moment with DSLR is quite

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.910 
captivate that moment with DSLR is quite
hard<00:00:12.809> because<00:00:12.960> sometimes<00:00:13.290> those<00:00:13.650> moments

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
hard because sometimes those moments

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.890 
hard because sometimes those moments
really<00:00:14.250> come<00:00:14.549> once-in-a-lifetime<00:00:15.210> there's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
really come once-in-a-lifetime there's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.240 
really come once-in-a-lifetime there's
things<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.199> Google<00:00:16.590> glass<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.130> do

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
things like Google glass that can do

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.189 
things like Google glass that can do
that<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> five<00:00:17.820> megapixel<00:00:18.029> camera<00:00:18.810> doesn't

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
that but a five megapixel camera doesn't

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.109 
that but a five megapixel camera doesn't
really<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.619> justice<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.130> my<00:00:20.279> opinion<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
really do it justice in my opinion and a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
really do it justice in my opinion and a
DSLR<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> great<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.320> again<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.980> heavy

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
DSLR is great but again it's so heavy

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740 
DSLR is great but again it's so heavy
and<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.460> takes<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.850> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> time<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.689> ahead

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and it takes a lot of time to go ahead

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.300
