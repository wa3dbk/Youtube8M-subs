00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.809
 hi all topics are 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.160
 find today for a new 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.259
 tutorial and today I'm going to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.619
 learn to just play with 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.090
 a ps3 throttle on gta 5 because like 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.009
 in my case I do not have a controller 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.430
 xbox 360 and I wish to play with a 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.219
 controller 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.020
 so I have a ps3 notepad 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.730
 I want to play with and with this little 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.980
 tutorial we will learn how to use it 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 the first step is to download 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.910
 a little software called motion 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.820
 enjoy 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.289
 so when you can find here I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.149
 you will put the link in the description 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.589
 once it's done we have our little one 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.019
 folder so that on our desk we 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.999
 double click on it and we extract it 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.109
 for example somewhere like on the 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:57.319
 group once it's done on double 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:02.339
 click is done run 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:06.290
 we continue we do next next next 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.290
 creates an icon on the euro and installs it 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.970
 once it's done we'll launch it 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 so here it opens a small page 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.520
 but we do not care about it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 so that brings us to this small page 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.370
 so at that moment so there you do not 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.990
 can not see it but i'm having trouble with ps3 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.360
 on my desk I will then plug it in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.130
 in usb 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.500
 that's the little noise we 're going to have 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.990
 normally the small notification in 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.270
 bottom right we will go in drive 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 manager and there you see that six young 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.510
 to branches and that I revenge it 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 there is an extra port so there so 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.820
 the other port below it must be that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.190
 must be my helmet or so my the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 matsuri loader so we it's 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.460
 this one that we are interested in so 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.410
 we will click on the small box before 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.170
 and we're going to do the driver dude 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.580
 to put a little time here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 once it's over so normally 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.020
 it should take you more time 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.030
 it's because I already did it at the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.069
 end you would have the other driver strong and has 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.730
 prevailed to completed once that's 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.780
 that we return to the profile here you 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.060
 select low you do not have the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.450
 choice since anyway he there he the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.450
 captures 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.959
 here you put a default green put xbox 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.489
 360 emulator controller so there actually 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.470
 it's to make him understand that you 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.200
 want to switch your ps3 controller 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.819
 for an xbox 360 joystick the led 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.439
 it's just to see if your controller 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.510
 is well connected so there you can 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.769
 for example either put the battery 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.470
 information at that time on the 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.049
 ps3 controller you will see the icon finally 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.430
 the successive loading of 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.349
 different LEDs that light up 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.700
 me for example I put a custom just 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.379
 for it to work and so me by 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.909
 example and the 2 button that lit 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.370
 so it shows that it's connect 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.930
 to the software to do a little test on 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.190
 will do a vacuum dressing testing you 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.389
 go i 'm going to approach micro you're going 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.670
 to hear that so that means that the 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.200
 the joystick is well perceived by software 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.639
 did an album 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.159
 once that's it you can 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.590
 now play gta 5 with a joystick 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.540
 of ps3 did a little test I you 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.870
 found in a moment for the part 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.129
 on gta 5 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.709
 so here we are in the 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.799
 part gta 5 so there I am 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.019
 currently playing with a 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.269
 joystick so absolutely no problem 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.329
 it works really very well just 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.519
 little info that can be not bad when 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.379
 you go into settings and you 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.709
 go in man is by default see you 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.239
 there is the image of the xbox 360 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.629
 if you set up your controller then there 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.980
 with the software that I passed you there 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.560
 will consider it as an xbox controller 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.299
 so it's going to be the same keys 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.650
 however, there is a small problem in 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.379
 know that between the joystick 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.510
 playstation 3 and the xbox 360 controller 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.659
 the top buttons namely for example 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.889
 for the playstation 3 l1 l2 r1 r2 are 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.299
 reversed that is to say that for the 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.970
 playstation 3 joystick the button 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.829
 principal is a before l1 r1 then 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.780
 that for the xbox 360 controller these are 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.139
 the two buttons from the back of the 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.720
 controller 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.239
 so for that to order type 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.769
 third person actually will not base on 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.690
 standard if you see for example the 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.190
 shot and take cover and beats for 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.900
 whether for a ps3 controller you 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.550
 switch to AC and at this time 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.840
 there it will put like a joystick 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.130
 ps3 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.990
 and that's so it really helps 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.400
 play with the ps3 controller so there 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.100
 you see I play with the joystick 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.480
 we really hope super nice and 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.850
 it's a lot more practical than the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.440
 keyboard mouse so that's this video you 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.830
 please do not hesitate to let go a little 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.300
 I love 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.920
