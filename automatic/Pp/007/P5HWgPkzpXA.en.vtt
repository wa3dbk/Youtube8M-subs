00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
so let's go look again before we go

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.340 
so let's go look again before we go
Prince<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:00.940> just<00:01:01.150> a<00:01:01.239> quick<00:01:01.420> overview<00:01:01.780> of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
Prince it is just a quick overview of

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.369 
Prince it is just a quick overview of
the<00:01:02.440> test<00:01:02.739> layer<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:04.449> de<00:01:04.660> sort<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.900> grew<00:01:05.080> from

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
the test layer this de sort of grew from

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.500 
the test layer this de sort of grew from
a<00:01:06.210> run<00:01:07.210> round<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.510> wall<00:01:07.720> really<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.729> grew

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
a run round the wall really then grew

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.469 
a run round the wall really then grew
into<00:01:10.780> some<00:01:10.960> yards<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.060> couple<00:01:13.060> reversing

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
into some yards and couple reversing

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.040 
into some yards and couple reversing
loops<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.670> she's<00:01:16.270> all<00:01:16.390> going<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.600> go<00:01:18.899> so<00:01:19.899> let's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
loops but she's all going to go so let's

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:29.470 
loops but she's all going to go so let's
cup<00:01:20.259> shed<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:21.310> have<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.580> look

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.140 

okay<00:01:30.200> enough<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.790> come<00:01:31.790> on<00:01:31.880> let's<00:01:32.120> go

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
okay enough of that come on let's go

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
guess where we'll be walking and this

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.609 
guess where we'll be walking and this
will<00:02:04.659> be<00:02:04.780> paid<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.170> eventually<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:08.500> is

will be paid and eventually this is

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.390 
will be paid and eventually this is
Bruno<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:10.000> neighbor's<00:02:10.330> cat<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:12.280> are<00:02:12.340> you

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
have a look at some see how much solar

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.940 
have a look at some see how much solar
energy<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.860> making<00:02:35.010> today

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
bad for a 1.7 kilowatt system and that's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.530 
bad for a 1.7 kilowatt system and that's
all<00:02:49.599> right<00:02:53.700> well<00:02:54.700> trendsetters<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.360> roller

of the big reversing loops I've sort of

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.400 
of the big reversing loops I've sort of
like<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.200> tehachapi<00:03:41.680> loop<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:43.140> that's<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
like it tehachapi loop and that's the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.150 
like it tehachapi loop and that's the
helix<00:03:45.040> area<00:03:45.400> there<00:03:45.720> near<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.769> solar<00:03:47.769> inverter

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.740 

this<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> day<00:03:51.790> before<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.209> sheathing<00:03:52.540> so

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
this is a day before the sheathing so

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.690 
this is a day before the sheathing so
last<00:03:53.019> time<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.290> see<00:03:53.410> all<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.590> framework<00:03:53.890> in

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
last time to see all this framework in

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.210 
last time to see all this framework in
its<00:03:54.910> nude<00:03:55.750> state<00:03:58.500> as<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.890> other<00:03:59.980> side<00:04:00.190> of

its nude state as on the other side of
the<00:04:00.340> layout<00:04:00.609> looking<00:04:00.880> back<00:04:01.030> towards<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
the layout looking back towards the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.229 
the layout looking back towards the
helix<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.549> that's<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.700> entrance<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
helix and that's the entrance to the

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.690 
helix and that's the entrance to the
lair<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.690> there

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.710 

okay<00:04:10.700> now<00:04:10.849> we're<00:04:10.970> standing<00:04:11.120> over<00:04:11.510> near<00:04:11.629> the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
okay now we're standing over near the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.899 
okay now we're standing over near the
tehachapi<00:04:12.470> star<00:04:12.709> loop<00:04:12.950> which<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.370> suppose<00:04:13.849> I

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
tehachapi star loop which I suppose I

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.060 
tehachapi star loop which I suppose I
should<00:04:14.150> make<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.360> name<00:04:14.569> up<00:04:14.750> for<00:04:14.959> looking<00:04:15.709> back

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
should make a name up for looking back

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.280 
should make a name up for looking back
towards<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.940> helix<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> other<00:04:18.049> side<00:04:18.260> of

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
towards the helix and the other side of

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.930 
towards the helix and the other side of
the<00:04:18.410> layout<00:04:18.680> sort<00:04:19.040> of<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.160> whole<00:04:19.340> overview<00:04:19.850> of

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
the layout sort of a whole overview of

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.600 
the layout sort of a whole overview of
the<00:04:20.000> room<00:04:20.440> sort<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.470> incredibly<00:04:22.040> boring<00:04:22.340> isn't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
the room sort of incredibly boring isn't

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.129 
the room sort of incredibly boring isn't
it<00:04:22.870> but<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.960> asked<00:04:24.139> for<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:29.139> okay

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
it but you asked for it okay

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.590 
it but you asked for it okay
trendsetters<00:04:30.680> we're<00:04:30.860> back<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.370> couple<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.419> days

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
trendsetters we're back a couple of days

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.960 
trendsetters we're back a couple of days
after<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.199> we've<00:04:33.949> seeded<00:04:34.190> all<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.550> room<00:04:34.699> now

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
after and we've seeded all the room now

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.990 
after and we've seeded all the room now
apart<00:04:35.930> from<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.139> ceiling<00:04:36.729> so<00:04:37.729> it<00:04:37.790> looks<00:04:37.820> a

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
apart from the ceiling so it looks a

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.420 
apart from the ceiling so it looks a
little<00:04:38.180> bit<00:04:38.449> different<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:40.070> suppose

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
little bit different and I suppose

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.070 
little bit different and I suppose
bigger<00:04:40.669> in<00:04:40.790> some<00:04:40.970> ways<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.479> smaller<00:04:41.930> than

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
bigger in some ways and smaller than

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.189 
bigger in some ways and smaller than
Earth<00:04:43.090> once<00:04:44.090> again<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.389> helix<00:04:44.690> area<00:04:44.990> there

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
and the inverter panning down to well

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.230

we're<00:04:49.610> sort<00:04:49.699> of<00:04:49.789> standing<00:04:50.030> where<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
we're sort of standing where the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.930 
we're sort of standing where the
