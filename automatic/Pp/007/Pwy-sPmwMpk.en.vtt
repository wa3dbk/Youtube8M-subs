00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 is janne-friederike Meyer with Lambrasco 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.720
 I have to say the artistic couple in this German quartet 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.039
 Basically, you can not fix it from the start 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.429
 how the world is here is improvisation talent janne-friederike 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.429
 Meyer with her mopeds nicknames is on the way 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.650
 so Achterl on jumps 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 treacherous obstacle way plank sometimes overlook the horses altogether 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.470
 The second pole in the Oxer also likes to register or register afterwards very late 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 but all right so far 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.950
 and I do not have the full three now have to really settle down in this 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.030
 simple combination acrobatics starts now 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.930
 and what should you do for the first time with this most difficult line through the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 Diagonal and the line of fire 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.650
 the blond Dern from Hamburg he has nerves like wire ropes 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.490
 self-confidence 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.540
 and just an instinct 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
 for her horse for the situation 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 reigns 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 Otto Becker they suck direct Meinrad 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.430
 that's what she does now 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 and also takes six gallop track more 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.649
 and again quite as extreme back and afford 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 after that he was for Germany and elsewhere 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 so far, they did as the market 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.840
 I do not think that all this was over was planned 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.550
 Euro reserved 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.910
 the planning starts with the former when they present the starting line after 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.580
 The many miscarriages these ultimately felt was the prohibition they come 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.920
 From the motion author Walter Kappacher interested in no reliance he said for 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 all temporary workers had the chance 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.349
 maybe opened 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
 A refusal was ruled because I wanted to see 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.889
 he served the work for her 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:38.159
 the course before the products everything else is past Wagner embodies 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:39.809
 Schönbächler is
