hands on Oscar De La Hoya I think this

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:10.999

is<00:06:09.539> a<00:06:09.569> fight<00:06:09.810> between<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:10.110> businessman<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:10.919> a

is a fight between a businessman and a

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.459 
is a fight between a businessman and a
warrior<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:12.300> think<00:06:12.629> just<00:06:13.020> like<00:06:13.139> we<00:06:13.259> saw

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
warrior and I think just like we saw

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.670 
warrior and I think just like we saw
against<00:06:13.830> Caballero<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:14.759> Steve<00:06:15.509> Molitor<00:06:15.960> you

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
against Caballero and Steve Molitor you

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.459 
against Caballero and Steve Molitor you
know<00:06:16.830> when<00:06:17.159> the<00:06:17.370> bid<00:06:17.550> when<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.110> technician<00:06:19.110> or

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
know when the bid when the technician or

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.800 
know when the bid when the technician or
the<00:06:19.860> businessman<00:06:20.279> gets<00:06:20.610> in<00:06:20.849> you<00:06:21.690> know

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
the businessman gets in you know

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.869 
the businessman gets in you know
waist-deep<00:06:22.349> with<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:22.889> guy<00:06:23.099> who's<00:06:23.310> ready<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.610> die

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
waist-deep with a guy who's ready to die

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.570 
waist-deep with a guy who's ready to die
for<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.659> cause<00:06:24.840> I<00:06:25.289> think<00:06:26.099> he<00:06:26.219> might<00:06:26.370> just

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
for the cause I think he might just

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.909 
for the cause I think he might just
bitch<00:06:26.789> up<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.120> fold<00:06:27.389> up<00:06:27.599> so<00:06:27.930> I'm<00:06:28.560> going<00:06:28.830> with

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
bitch up and fold up so I'm going with

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.070 
bitch up and fold up so I'm going with
Manny<00:06:29.129> by<00:06:29.340> knockout<00:06:29.759> wherever<00:06:30.690> you<00:06:30.810> can<00:06:30.900> get

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
Manny by knockout wherever you can get

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.930 
Manny by knockout wherever you can get
at<00:06:31.229> least<00:06:31.259> five<00:06:31.590> uh<00:06:31.620> five<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:32.310> one<00:06:32.490> odds<00:06:32.639> and

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
at least five uh five to one odds and

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.399 
at least five uh five to one odds and
say<00:06:33.060> go<00:06:33.210> ahead<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:33.509> put<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.719> little<00:06:33.779> change<00:06:34.169> on

say go ahead and put a little change on
that<00:06:34.650> I<00:06:34.860> think<00:06:35.490> that's<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.699> way<00:06:35.759> to<00:06:35.849> go<00:06:36.090> and

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
that I think that's the way to go and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.059 
that I think that's the way to go and
that's<00:06:36.330> where<00:06:36.659> my<00:06:36.840> bet<00:06:37.139> when<00:06:37.349> i'm<00:06:37.440> on<00:06:37.560> vegas<00:06:37.949> is
