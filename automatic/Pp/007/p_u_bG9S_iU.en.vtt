00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.520
 although, well, I eat, I 'm even 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.740
 if I bring you how to make arrows 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.500
 explosives in addition to grenades 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.510
 minecraft totally without mods and good 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.610
 I'm going to a small demonstration for 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.369
 that you can get an idea here in this 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.110
 this web testing hole so that it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 can give an idea look fixed is pulled 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.919
 the arrow and the arrow explodes see what 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 epic is this is super god gave me 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.810
 this as power noted here I have the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 mechanism and this can only be 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.640
 do on nights of the 1.8 in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.559
 go ahead not then if you're in 1.7 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.840
 or backwards because you will not be able to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 do unfortunately as it implements 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.899
 the new versions of concerts with 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.089
 controls that help to do this fails 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.129
 explain as easy as possible 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.420
 look at everything this has 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 notice everything they have in case 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.070
 they want to make a replica you this 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 I'm going to open this each of the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.570
 commands so you can put him 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.180
 pause and put them in internal sum if 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 they want this to make you a replica 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.540
 do not 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 are all the commands are equal I'll 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.870
 Let's see if I can give you a description and 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.290
 Well, I'll explain it as much 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.720
 easy is as simple as you can 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.720
 I'm going to explain this and it's basically that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 start in this command this that detects 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.260
 if in the world there is an arrow not in this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.030
 case this detects that if there is an arrow 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.460
 over here if for example if I change it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.770
 snowball then it will not detect it as 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.600
 the snowballs do not but in this case 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.820
 is this an arrow 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.950
 this when detecting an arrow we are going to 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.439
 show this is to learn if it is for 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.690
 that an arrow as you can see turns on 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.030
 and send the signal for here, do not be 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.310
 send the signal because you want here 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.979
 well this supposes they do not stop 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.649
 seen yet but good move me that this 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.869
 will appear a tnt here in the water not 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.899
 Internet is activated and when the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.729
 signal that is to have you is 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.399
 activated is going to have to transport towards 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.840
 the towards the arrow is not going to 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.840
 It seems that when he launched the arrow 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.600
 it explodes or is me when it throws the arrow 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120
 a TNT is teleported to the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.040
 arrow and they explode or they are not and talk to me 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.840
 It made me understand the same, I can tell you 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.470
 make you a reply with all the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.720
 commands can pause and you can go 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.550
 putting the commands in place here 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.730
 so you can see how everything is 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.319
 built and well I tell them too 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.560
 you can make grenades and here we put 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.810
 is do not come back here we put snowball and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.680
 Here we also change the arrow to 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 snowball 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.269
 we are him 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.730
 now instead of being a weapon of 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.710
 explosions is going to be a grenade 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.840
 goodbye to move to the peak of the 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.330
 truth is very good this good 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.830
 fate something yes that for example if here 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.930
 I do this 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.920
 This is going to explode around here and I think it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.300
 died 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.150
 that is , if for example I do this and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.830
 I'm very much going to explode here 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.840
 but that's what the water is for, not for that 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.450
 is that the water is always there 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.730
 you have to take care shoot what I saw of 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.580
 far not when he gets to read us then there 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.860
 is when the pomegranate is sent or good 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.440
 rather he puts more pomegranate but 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.690
 well this is all how they can subtract 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.750
 terrific this imagine on a server 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.780
 to be this mechanism and you can make a 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.670
 Desmadre totally seriously is very 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.620
 good is the idea I found it in 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.870
 reddit more than I did all this 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.300
 mechanism because the creator who did it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.340
 in network he did not say it like he did then 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.350
 I had to devise them a little bit besides 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.630
 reading the comments of redit this 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.270
 well there are more explained that they had to 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.330
 you had to do to do it not in 7 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.610
 simple this one I tell you simply this one 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.860
 detects if there is an entity in this case 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.990
 put the entity you want in this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 case then it's a good snow and when 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.320
 be in the air in the snowball you go 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.810
 to make you get transported a tnt 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.730
 towards the snowball then 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.830
 this is basically everything 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.040
 without having given to explain well I do not have 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.489
 idea I say it's understandable no but 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.590
 well this I hope support this video and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.629
 that I tell them a deal to make lives a 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.699
 little different and I got tired a little bit of 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.530
 do the typical survivor series and so on 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.750
 although I will not do new series in 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.729
 my channel used to do many series before 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.470
 survival and the truth is that like 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.690
 Tired a little besides that many people 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.210
 has to be series series survivor 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.060
 series of I do not know what series of hunger 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.760
 games and I spend a little bit not doing 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.440
 more of the same then back can 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.270
 do not even vary a bit though 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.860
 it's the same game but then vary a 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.229
 little is not bad then please 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.580
 I hope you support this kind of 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.500
 then things will also take in 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.600
 obviously, it will be easier for me to do 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.820
 just record me playing on a map 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.530
 normal and ready I will leave much easier 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.190
 but I tell them I like to make this a 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.320
 little more interesting then well 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.780
 do not forget to support if you want more videos 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.550
 of that type and good is also me 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.350
 I did not show you this simply because 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.040
 you get to look for this if there ever is 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.260
 an error and that here a flying rest 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.230
 it simply itches if it is going to reset 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.640
 all eyes there is no problem 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.490
 same if it comes to julia is not very 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.560
 I miss that this mechanism mocks but 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.260
 then it just makes you here and ready 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.970
 Well, this one I hope you try it and 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.560
 they worked on themselves or if they have 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.300
 some problem then well 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.100
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.100
 until next time
