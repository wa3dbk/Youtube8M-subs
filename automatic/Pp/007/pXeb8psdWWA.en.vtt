happen and if we do get a if we do get a
move<00:01:04.949> lower<00:01:05.220> again<00:01:05.670> we'll<00:01:05.880> put<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
move lower again we'll put it well it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
move lower again we'll put it well it
should<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:07.740> measured

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
a double top here right at the six one

a double top here right at the six one
eight<00:04:17.280> took<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.459> took<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.700> short<00:04:18.940> position<00:04:19.120> there

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
eight took I took a short position there

market<00:04:20.500> rallied<00:04:20.890> against<00:04:21.790> me<00:04:21.970> for<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.750> loss

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
market rallied against me for a loss

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.240 
market rallied against me for a loss
then<00:04:24.160> looked<00:04:24.430> at<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.640> projection<00:04:26.010> from<00:04:27.010> that

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
then looked at a projection from that

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.910 
then looked at a projection from that
break<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.400> structure<00:04:30.880> or<00:04:31.170> that<00:04:32.170> Fibonacci

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
break of structure or that Fibonacci

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.220 
break of structure or that Fibonacci
failure<00:04:33.490> for<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> completion<00:04:34.810> somewhere

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
failure for a completion somewhere

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.330 
failure for a completion somewhere
around<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:36.690> 127<00:04:37.690> one<00:04:37.870> six<00:04:38.200> one<00:04:38.260> eight<00:04:38.440> again

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
around the 127 one six one eight again

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.330 
around the 127 one six one eight again
took<00:04:40.060> out<00:04:40.300> short<00:04:40.900> positions<00:04:41.380> here<00:04:41.710> as<00:04:41.830> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
took out short positions here as the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.110 
took out short positions here as the
market<00:04:42.700> showed<00:04:42.970> bearish<00:04:43.900> divergence<00:04:43.930> and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
market showed bearish divergence and

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.370 
market showed bearish divergence and
market<00:04:46.120> pulled<00:04:46.330> back<00:04:46.510> just<00:04:46.540> slightly<00:04:47.080> before

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
market pulled back just slightly before

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.830 
market pulled back just slightly before
moving<00:04:47.830> up<00:04:48.070> again<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:48.669> I've<00:04:49.090> taken<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.540> couple

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
moving up again so I've taken a couple

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.650 
moving up again so I've taken a couple
of<00:04:49.930> losses<00:04:50.140> on<00:04:50.470> this<00:04:50.710> as<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.460> Fibonacci's<00:04:52.150> and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
of losses on this as the Fibonacci's and

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.650 
of losses on this as the Fibonacci's and
that<00:04:53.350> continued<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.070> fail<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.550> now<00:04:55.210> looking

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
that continued to fail and now looking

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.800 
that continued to fail and now looking
at<00:04:55.860> 127<00:04:56.860> completion<00:04:57.580> pattern<00:04:57.940> right<00:04:58.480> here<00:04:58.510> in

days in the in the Japanese yen there's
there<00:05:09.070> I'm<00:05:09.820> told<00:05:10.090> they're<00:05:10.270> coming<00:05:10.540> close<00:05:10.720> to

there I'm told they're coming close to
the<00:05:10.930> end<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.290> year<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.650> doesn't<00:05:11.830> really

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
the end of the year it doesn't really

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.490 
the end of the year it doesn't really
matter<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.610> doesn't<00:05:12.790> affect<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.750> way<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:13.960> trade

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
matter it doesn't affect the way I trade

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.480 
matter it doesn't affect the way I trade
but<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.700> know<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:17.680> yen<00:05:17.919> has<00:05:17.950> not<00:05:18.250> been

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
pattern here recently we just seen

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.900 
pattern here recently we just seen
pattern<00:05:23.500> failure<00:05:23.860> after<00:05:24.040> pattern<00:05:24.490> failure

pattern failure after pattern failure

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.000 
pattern failure after pattern failure
and<00:05:25.090> it's<00:05:25.840> just<00:05:26.080> in<00:05:26.229> it's<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:26.919> a

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
non-conforming trend right now and when

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.810 
non-conforming trend right now and when
we<00:05:29.200> break<00:05:29.410> out<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.890> we'll<00:05:30.340> make<00:05:30.490> some<00:05:30.729> more

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
we break out of it we'll make some more

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.960 
we break out of it we'll make some more
good<00:05:31.000> money<00:05:31.240> on<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.600> but<00:05:32.020> for<00:05:32.169> right<00:05:32.200> now<00:05:32.970> we're

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
good money on it but for right now we're

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.070 
good money on it but for right now we're
just<00:05:34.000> you<00:05:34.990> know<00:05:35.020> we're<00:05:35.380> all<00:05:35.500> flat<00:05:35.800> on<00:05:35.979> the
