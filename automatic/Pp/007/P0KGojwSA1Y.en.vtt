00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
22 won't be gaming and we're on step

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
22 won't be gaming and we're on step
three<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.020> easter<00:00:22.410> egg<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:23.939> are

three of this easter egg now there are

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.400 
three of this easter egg now there are
three<00:00:24.270> parts<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.400> step<00:00:26.539> if<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:28.079> remember

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
three parts to this step if I remember

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
three parts to this step if I remember
correctly<00:00:28.669> so<00:00:29.669> after<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.270> put<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:30.599> skillet

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
correctly so after you put the skillet

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.600 
correctly so after you put the skillet
there<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> after<00:00:31.439> frying<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:32.040> soles<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
there and after frying the soles you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.000 
there and after frying the soles you
place<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.269> grill<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.769> have<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
place on this grill and then you have to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.520 
place on this grill and then you have to
find<00:00:35.190> four<00:00:35.580> pieces<00:00:35.879> of<00:00:36.059> meat<00:00:36.449> that's<00:00:37.080> located

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
find four pieces of meat that's located

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.090 
find four pieces of meat that's located
around<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.309> map<00:00:38.610> now<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.230> spawn<00:00:40.559> locations

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
around the map now the spawn locations

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
around the map now the spawn locations
are<00:00:41.280> completely<00:00:42.180> random<00:00:42.570> there's<00:00:42.750> multiple

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
are completely random there's multiple

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.140 
are completely random there's multiple
spawn<00:00:43.710> locations<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.400> we<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.699> narrowed<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
spawn locations but we have narrowed it

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.780 
spawn locations but we have narrowed it
down<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.129> there's<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.250> least<00:00:47.280> there's

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
down so that there's at least there's

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.760 
down so that there's at least there's
one<00:00:47.940> meat<00:00:48.180> piece<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.690> meat<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.320> four<00:00:49.559> main

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
one meat piece of meat in the four main

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.720 
one meat piece of meat in the four main
areas<00:00:50.239> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.530> map<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.280> posit<00:00:53.699> for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
areas of the the map so if I posit for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.860 
areas of the the map so if I posit for
you<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.120> sick<00:00:54.359> as<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.629> burger<00:00:57.629> tear

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you as sick as you can see burger tear

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
you as sick as you can see burger tear
and<00:00:58.020> atlas<00:00:58.350> command<00:00:58.739> value<00:00:59.280> voltage<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and atlas command value voltage in the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
and atlas command value voltage in the
sewers<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.350> there's<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.800> piece<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> meat<00:01:02.309> in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
sewers so there's one piece of meat in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
sewers so there's one piece of meat in
each<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.850> four<00:01:03.120> sections<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.899> their

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
each of these four sections and their

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.430 
each of these four sections and their
spawn<00:01:05.070> points<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.550> different<00:01:05.880> each<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.440> so

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
spawn points are different each time so

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.770 
spawn points are different each time so
I've<00:01:08.070> already<00:01:08.340> added<00:01:08.640> three<00:01:09.090> we're<00:01:09.570> gonna

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I've already added three we're gonna

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.210 
I've already added three we're gonna
grab<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.170> fourth<00:01:10.440> piece<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:12.830> ok<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.130> are

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
grab the fourth piece now ok here we are

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
grab the fourth piece now ok here we are
an<00:01:14.460> atlas<00:01:14.789> command<00:01:15.179> if<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.660> come<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.990> here

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
an atlas command if you come up here

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
an atlas command if you come up here
this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.800> last<00:01:17.039> one<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.910> what<00:01:18.149> they

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
this is my last one that's what they

this is my last one that's what they
look<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.500> hold<00:01:19.830> X<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> pick<00:01:20.459> it<00:01:20.580> up

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
look like you just hold X to pick it up

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.260 
look like you just hold X to pick it up
and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.819> screen<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and you can see on the screen at the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.180 
and you can see on the screen at the
bottom<00:01:24.360> left<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.050> that<00:01:25.319> is<00:01:25.440> it's<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.039> my

are<00:01:41.910> back<00:01:42.119> at<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.420> frying<00:01:42.690> pan<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:42.959> Burger

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
are back at the frying pan and Burger

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.800 
are back at the frying pan and Burger
Time<00:01:43.619> hold<00:01:44.550> X<00:01:44.819> to<00:01:44.970> add<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.209> last<00:01:45.420> piece<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
Time hold X to add your last piece of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
Time hold X to add your last piece of
meat<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.319> is<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.619> happens<00:01:47.209> it<00:01:48.209> turns

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
meat and this is what happens it turns

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.010 
meat and this is what happens it turns
into<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.080> patio<00:01:49.679> like<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> burger<00:01:50.489> and<00:01:51.020> i

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
into like a patio like a burger and i

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.540 
into like a patio like a burger and i
assume<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.349> a<00:01:52.410> zombie<00:01:52.590> me<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.250> looks<00:01:53.399> pretty

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
assume is a zombie me is it looks pretty

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.020 
assume is a zombie me is it looks pretty
run<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.899> anyway<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.319> that's<00:01:55.729> that's<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
run so anyway so that's that's the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.660 
run so anyway so that's that's the
burger<00:01:57.770> now<00:01:59.090> after<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.239> burger<00:02:00.920> there's<00:02:01.920> two

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
burger now after the burger there's two

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.089 
burger now after the burger there's two
more<00:02:02.849> two<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.539> parts<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.259> step<00:02:04.590> first

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
more two more parts to this step first

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.119 
more two more parts to this step first
of<00:02:05.310> which<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.660> get<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.440> magnetron

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
of which we need to get the magnetron

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.460 
of which we need to get the magnetron
from<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> mystery<00:02:09.149> box<00:02:09.330> which<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.319> new

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
from the mystery box which is the new

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.550 
from the mystery box which is the new
Wonder<00:02:10.770> weapon<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> microwave<00:02:11.940> gun

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.690 

there<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.709> go<00:02:19.890> guys<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.519> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
there you go guys so that's the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.750 
there you go guys so that's the
magnetron<00:02:21.269> right<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:22.099> so<00:02:23.099> once<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.730> have

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
magnetron right there so once you have

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.819 
magnetron right there so once you have
the<00:02:24.030> magnetron<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:25.019> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.409> straight

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
the magnetron you want to go straight

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
cooking I know the third and final part

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.520 
cooking I know the third and final part
for<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.079> step<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.939> we<00:02:50.939> need<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.359> locate<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
for this step is we need to locate a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.699 
for this step is we need to locate a
burger<00:02:53.250> bun<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.169> we<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.409> make<00:02:55.560> the

burger okay guys because I'm on a high

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.720 
burger okay guys because I'm on a high
round<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.769> going<00:02:58.919> to<00:02:58.980> use<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.250> glitch<00:02:59.489> for

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
round I'm going to use the glitch for

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.599 
round I'm going to use the glitch for
this<00:02:59.819> part<00:03:01.790> because<00:03:02.790> what<00:03:02.969> we<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.419> do<00:03:03.629> is

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
this part because what we have to do is

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.789 
this part because what we have to do is
if<00:03:05.609> you<00:03:05.849> look<00:03:06.000> closely<00:03:06.510> during<00:03:07.290> some<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
if you look closely during some of the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.129 
if you look closely during some of the
rounds<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.909> will<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.269> some<00:03:09.510> zombies<00:03:09.930> without

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
rounds you will see some zombies without

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.110 
rounds you will see some zombies without
any<00:03:10.439> actual<00:03:10.709> shoes<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.459> they<00:03:11.879> will<00:03:12.000> be

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
any actual shoes and they will be

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.670 
any actual shoes and they will be
wearing<00:03:12.389> their<00:03:12.540> burger<00:03:13.019> town<00:03:13.230> employee

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
wearing their burger town employee

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.309 
wearing their burger town employee
uniforms<00:03:14.669> so<00:03:15.359> there<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.719> zombies<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:16.169> we

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
uniforms so there the zombies that we

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.520 
uniforms so there the zombies that we
want<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:17.370> after<00:03:17.639> you<00:03:17.969> kill<00:03:18.209> them<00:03:18.419> it<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.109> think

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
want now after you kill them it I think

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.349 
want now after you kill them it I think
it's<00:03:19.650> kind<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.889> random<00:03:20.129> I'm<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:20.699> sure<00:03:20.909> if<00:03:21.209> it's

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
it's kind of random I'm not sure if it's

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.420 
it's kind of random I'm not sure if it's
something<00:03:22.349> that<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.889> trigger<00:03:23.220> but

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
something that you have to trigger but

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.830 
something that you have to trigger but
every<00:03:23.609> time<00:03:23.729> I<00:03:23.790> kill<00:03:24.120> them<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.389> takes<00:03:24.419> a<00:03:24.690> couple

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
every time I kill them it takes a couple

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.589 
every time I kill them it takes a couple
of<00:03:25.019> tries<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.729> every<00:03:26.729> burger<00:03:27.060> time<00:03:27.239> employee

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
of tries so every burger time employee

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.750 
of tries so every burger time employee
that<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.019> see<00:03:28.290> when<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.739> kill<00:03:28.979> him<00:03:29.190> just<00:03:29.519> walk
