00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
 here what we see 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.910
 how the cardiac minute volume is distributed 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.109
 or the cardiac output that the same as we said 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.830
 in different tissues 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.150
 Resting 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.189
 and in exercise 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.849
 Resting 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.539
 which are the clear columns 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.579
 percent the most only for the 60 kg 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.079
 of the volume minutes they were the brain 14% 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.410
 reviews 22% 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.410
 and given 27 percent 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.180
 of the total minute volume at rest 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.370
 and in exercise, look at you 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 the muscles if they go 66% 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.110
 and the skin 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.860
 if he was going 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.280
 15% between the two of us are in potch in tap percent 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.650
 the muscles if they go 82 66% and the skin 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.320
 15% this big increase 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.639
 in the muscles 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:03.490
 the skin 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.130
 is for the muscles to function properly and on the skin so that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370
 be a control 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.960
 explain us 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 and good of the body temperature 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.170
 let's fix this not this graphic above actress in percentage of the minute volume 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 of cardiac output milestones in absolute liters about minutes whether we measure 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.590
 liter not in percentage 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.900
 and we'll see it 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 the cardiac output 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.020
 percent and in exercise 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.180
 the muscles and they go 16 like 5 liters and the skin 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.190
 four comma 8 liters and was fourth in a previous positive way 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080
 Kirk spending 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 percent the total minute volume at rest 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.090
 on average 5 liters 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.520
 and here in effort, the muscles and the skin have already risen the cat 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.250
 and the cardiac ap 20 liters 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.560
 ditto eyes as the brain in repo effortlessly more or less maintain the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.729
 same liters 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.569
 per minute if they go a liter 0 7 at rest a liter 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.569
 per minute of blood that I did to the brain 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.469
 percent to the heart muscle greatly increases the heart muscle 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.499
 in repose josé aleixandre that if it comes through crown days 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.519
 at rest are 0 2 liters per minute 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.319
 and fivefold the blood that the heart muscle did in an effort not 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.729
 it is precise crossed 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.049
 the kidneys more or less keep 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.560
 although the country basso renal constriction 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.520
 in exercise i there is a slight fall 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.549
 the day or more or less keeps 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.839
 and here what I experienced is not stigmatized 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:58.829
 very 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.299
 very important but that in this pit 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.439
 It affects us 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.429
 the great loss 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.839
 volume 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:12.199
 they start greek that comes to all this while oscar the entire digestive tract 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.759
 during the effort 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.229
 that is, during the effort 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.269
 physical blood 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.229
 bárcena who is accused of basic muscles 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:29.109
 in him brain in the kidneys the liver roughly stays i the 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.370
 who loses 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.529
 In all this 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:37.539
 very much is the digestive tract and that concept is very important 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:38.679
 why 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:43.129
 to know what during the intense effort during the prolonged effort 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.299
 there and that is that the child has idealized digestive tract 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.539
 sometimes 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.859
 can give symptoms 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.879
 and at some point we are going to detail and what are the physical activities 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.569
 what 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.529
 they have a higher incidence in the production of tuy symptoms 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.749
 managers because I'm in my a 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.089
 physiological 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:12.980
 the normal hysteria of the tuy witness to the intense exercises 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.370
 il during 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.170
 and what can we do to counteract s what we're going to see 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.270
 percent at some point
