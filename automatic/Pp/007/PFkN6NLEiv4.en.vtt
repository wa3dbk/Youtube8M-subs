00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
gonna be there every year but then

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.870 
gonna be there every year but then
different<00:03:14.780> man<00:03:14.959> beaters<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.560> zone<00:03:16.520> beaters

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
different man beaters and zone beaters

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.580 
different man beaters and zone beaters
and<00:03:16.910> all<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.300> stuff<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.810> like<00:03:18.080> fade<00:03:18.350> routes

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
and all that stuff and like fade routes

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.729 
and all that stuff and like fade routes
for<00:03:19.090> for<00:03:20.090> example<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.600> Madden<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.170> lobster

reeks<00:03:21.890> last<00:03:22.130> year<00:03:22.310> we're<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:23.510> year

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
reeks last year we're just this year

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.840 
reeks last year we're just this year
we're<00:03:23.810> just<00:03:23.959> absolutely<00:03:24.050> ridiculous<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.040> so

we're just absolutely ridiculous and so
you<00:03:26.300> know<00:03:26.390> there's<00:03:26.600> every<00:03:27.110> year<00:03:27.230> there's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
you know there's every year there's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.540 
you know there's every year there's
gonna<00:03:27.500> be<00:03:27.590> something<00:03:27.860> like<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.459> just

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
gonna be something like that so we just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.190 
gonna be something like that so we just

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
how to slow that down and figure out how

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.520 
how to slow that down and figure out how
to<00:03:32.030> utilize<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.720> best<00:03:33.880> curl<00:03:34.880> route<00:03:35.530> scores

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
he could go all the way to the house

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.620 
he could go all the way to the house
with<00:03:43.010> 5<00:03:43.190> seconds<00:03:43.580> 4<00:03:43.730> seconds<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.420> half

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
with 5 seconds 4 seconds and a half

with 5 seconds 4 seconds and a half
tying<00:03:45.350> up<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.709> game<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.070> was<00:03:46.190> much<00:03:46.459> needed

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
tying up the game that was much needed

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.880 
tying up the game that was much needed
because<00:03:47.120> if<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.510> did<00:03:47.660> not<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.170> he<00:03:48.709> gets

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
because if I did not get that he gets

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
because if I did not get that he gets
the<00:03:48.980> ball<00:03:49.160> back<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.370> he<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.730> take<00:03:49.850> a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
the ball back and he can take a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.640 
the ball back and he can take a
two-possession<00:03:50.570> lead<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.260> got<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> little
