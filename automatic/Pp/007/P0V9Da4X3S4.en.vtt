so<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.690> can<00:01:39.840> use<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> cut<00:01:40.440> out<00:01:40.590> our

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so that we can use this to cut out our

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.530 
so that we can use this to cut out our

yeah
the<00:03:16.010> angles<00:03:16.370> are<00:03:16.519> cut<00:03:16.760> go<00:03:17.120> out<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.420> horizontal

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
the angles are cut go out the horizontal

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.809 
the angles are cut go out the horizontal
and<00:03:17.930> vertical<00:03:18.050> right<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.250> let's<00:03:22.489> look<00:03:22.670> at

and vertical right and so let's look at
the<00:03:22.940> big<00:03:23.150> picture<00:03:23.420> here<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.959> why<00:03:24.410> are<00:03:24.470> they

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
the big picture here that why are they

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.259 
the big picture here that why are they
putting<00:03:24.860> this<00:03:25.069> first<00:03:25.340> rafter<00:03:25.730> up<00:03:25.850> against<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
putting this first rafter up against the

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.759 
putting this first rafter up against the
wall<00:03:26.450> you're<00:03:26.600> putting<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:26.989> rafter<00:03:27.410> up<00:03:27.560> so

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
wall you're putting this rafter up so

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.009 
wall you're putting this rafter up so
they<00:03:27.890> can<00:03:28.100> get<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.640> exact<00:03:29.060> height<00:03:29.299> of<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.720> hip

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.600 
they can get the exact height of the hip
where<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.380> hip<00:03:30.500> needs<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.950> come<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.310> now<00:03:31.549> the

all of the other Jack studs I mean Jack

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.170 
all of the other Jack studs I mean Jack
routers<00:04:05.560> are<00:04:05.710> all<00:04:05.830> cut<00:04:06.040> pre-cut<00:04:06.520> with<00:04:07.060> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
routers are all cut pre-cut with the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.060 
routers are all cut pre-cut with the
same<00:04:07.420> chip<00:04:07.930> cut<00:04:08.170> this<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.650> cheek<00:04:08.830> cut

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
same chip cut this is the cheek cut

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.610 
same chip cut this is the cheek cut
that's<00:04:09.250> correct<00:04:09.550> if<00:04:10.210> I<00:04:10.810> bring<00:04:11.050> this<00:04:11.200> up<00:04:11.410> an

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
that's correct if I bring this up an

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.610 
that's correct if I bring this up an
angle<00:04:12.180> once<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.330> gets<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.720> point<00:04:14.020> where<00:04:14.500> it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
angle once it gets to the point where it

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.500 
angle once it gets to the point where it
intersects<00:04:15.070> with<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.370> hip<00:04:15.580> yeah<00:04:16.090> you'll<00:04:16.360> see

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
intersects with the hip yeah you'll see

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.930 
intersects with the hip yeah you'll see
that<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.959> plumb<00:04:17.230> cut<00:04:17.470> here<00:04:17.860> and<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.459> 45

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
that this is a plumb cut here and a 45

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.729 
that this is a plumb cut here and a 45
degree<00:04:19.120> angle<00:04:19.300> cut<00:04:19.600> here<00:04:19.989> right<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.680> think

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
degree angle cut here right and I think

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.140 
degree angle cut here right and I think
we're<00:04:20.980> ready<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.280> see<00:04:21.430> one<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:21.670> the<00:04:21.760> okay<00:04:21.970> one

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
we're ready to see one of the okay one

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.080 
we're ready to see one of the okay one
of<00:04:22.270> these<00:04:22.390> go<00:04:22.600> right<00:04:22.630> into<00:04:22.990> place<00:04:26.940> okay<00:04:27.940> now

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
of these go right into place okay now
