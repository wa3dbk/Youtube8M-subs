shape<00:00:24.180> something<00:00:24.689> that's<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> be

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
shape something that's going to be

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
shape something that's going to be
growing<00:00:25.560> thicker<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.550> want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.880> start<00:00:27.150> your

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
growing thicker you want to start your

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.179

work<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> round<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> couple

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
work in the round and there's a couple

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.830 
work in the round and there's a couple
of<00:00:29.340> different<00:00:29.670> ways<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.939> doing<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of different ways of doing that this is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560 
of different ways of doing that this is
one<00:00:31.289> way<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.300> fantastic<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
one way that I think is fantastic if you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
one way that I think is fantastic if you
want<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> close<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> first<00:00:35.250> initial

we've<00:01:28.350> made<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.250> magic<00:01:30.240> circle<00:01:30.659> as

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
we've made this little magic circle as

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.370 
we've made this little magic circle as
its<00:01:30.960> called

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
its called

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.319 
its called
and<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.310> crocheting<00:01:32.880> into

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and we're going to be crocheting into

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.740 
and we're going to be crocheting into
this<00:01:33.930> circle<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.680> our<00:01:34.770> round<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.540> don't

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
this circle for our round so we don't

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.999 
this circle for our round so we don't
have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> chain<00:01:37.200> yet<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
have a chain yet we just have this

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
have a chain yet we just have this
little<00:01:38.280> loop<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.579> pulled<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> first

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
little loop we pulled up so the first

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.590 
little loop we pulled up so the first
thing<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.560> chain<00:01:40.950> one

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
thing you're going to do is chain one

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.730 
thing you're going to do is chain one
we're<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.810> doing<00:01:42.960> single<00:01:43.259> crochet

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
we're going to be doing single crochet

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.630 
we're going to be doing single crochet
so<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> chain<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:46.770> filler<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.549> our

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so that chain one is just filler for our

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
so that chain one is just filler for our
round<00:01:47.939> we're<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.420> actually<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> count

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
round we're not actually going to count

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.499 
round we're not actually going to count
that<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.470> stitch<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.640> example<00:01:51.149> we'll

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that as a stitch in this example we'll

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
that as a stitch in this example we'll
just<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.780> ahead<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.259> do<00:01:52.470> eight<00:01:52.890> single

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
just go ahead and do eight single

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.630 
just go ahead and do eight single
crochets<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.119> we're<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
crochets so we're going to go into that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.020 
crochets so we're going to go into that
circle<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.700> we've<00:01:56.850> created<00:01:57.590> drop<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> loop

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
circle that we've created drop a loop

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.950 
circle that we've created drop a loop
