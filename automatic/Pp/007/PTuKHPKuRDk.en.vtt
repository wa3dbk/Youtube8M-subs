00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.610
 hello friends youtuber ozaki anime kite 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.000
 bringing sjl is an interesting news 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:12.130
 you have given them the will of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.889
 go back to playing your old-time games of 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.810
 playstation 1 but they do not have games 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.569
 original playstation 1 for running 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.310
 in playstation 3 well here I 'm going 

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:23.669
 to bring a method from which we will be able to 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.199
 play any game burned on discs 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.390
 on your playstation 3 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.849
 yes, eye 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 is a method only for the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.820
 super slim playstation3 because because 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.270
 they have a sliding lid what it has to do 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.629
 this with the other playstation this is 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.269
 can trick you into turning the disk 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.339
 while the stage is open which is what 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.530
 what are we going to need, we are going to make a 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.260
 swap disc is a disc exchange 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.989
 hot to be able to run the games 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.220
 pirate backups or whatever 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.650
 we are going to need first a 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.199
 playstation 3 super slim 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.649
 we're going to need scotch tape or such 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.990
 but an adhesive tape because in the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.890
 top right of the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.020
 playstation3 schmidt there is a little button 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.690
 that little button has to press it and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.210
 put an adhesive tape so that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.500
 that the button stays pressed 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.380
 we are going to need a card too 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.840
 a square a rectangle any 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.540
 thing a paper a plastic which is going 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.810
 to serve to insert it in the part 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.020
 lower left 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.990
 station 3 but we will not put the children 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.610
 neither like that nor do we have to put it only 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.909
 the little tip at the bottom 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.729
 left there is like a little button that 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.620
 pressing it activates the laser and it 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.330
 active 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.120
 the engine of the playstation3 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.640
 thus 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.520
 then to run the games we are going to 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.890
 be fine on an original record of 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.460
 playstation anyone can be a demo 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.380
 it can be a good old ultra game 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.200
 we only need the original game to 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 what for 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.580
 the mind that we have inserted a game of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.349
 play and we put the game we make sure 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.269
 which is placed above the belt and 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.099
 we press with a card a 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.709
 paper just at the bottom 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.129
 left is not so glued to the top is 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.019
 more or less a finger away has 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.690
 have to play with the lid until you find the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.690
 true button that is to let it press 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.850
 that way the disc will start to spin 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.470
 and as you can see here 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.210
 the recognized format disk is already 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.610
 playstation what are we going to do to 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.340
 then it is simply to take out the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.960
 disk even if it is spinning it does not matter no 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.960
 they will harm the reader nothing 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.630
 seemed like the goal in the pirate game or 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.840
 burned once they have inserted the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.410
 game just run and run in the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.410
 game 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.300
 As you can see, the logo came out 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.819
 this is not any fake, it's not that 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.189
 I'm fucking and it's a version 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.790
 recorded or downloaded from the playstation store 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.200
 it's real it 's a trick that I found it 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.489
 online I did not think I was going to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.489
 work but it works 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.019
 this is the weight of this cross 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.739
 how is a game burned what did the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.340
 yesterday and I do not have audio I think what 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.580
 what do you deserve? 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.819
 that's why you'll be surprised that there's no music 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.260
 background but the game itself works 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.260
 Any game 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.300
 well, let's do it one more time 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.270
 with a different game so they can see that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.040
 it's not just we take out the little card 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.690
 for 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.770
 playstation 3 and tell them that we have 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.810
 open one 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.830
 we put back the playstation game 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.830
 1 original 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.330
 the functions button 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.820
 we wait for the game to recognize ready 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.430
 here is the game 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.930
 we put another one different 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.930
 and we give the game a run 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.780
 remember this we can only do it in 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.460
 the playstation3 super sling so if 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.710
 you have a playstation 3 is super sling 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.810
 or are you about to buy a playstation 3 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.810
 super sling I recommend it 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.460
 we put you back 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.060
 we have original disk 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.940
 we wait for you to read 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.870
 the disc 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.000
 we give him to execute 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.760
 and now if the functional 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.760
 you may not get the hang of it 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:28.670
 do not take the trick so fast but if 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.670
 it works fine until it's a hacked game 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.680
 the game that I just put is the 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.479
 space 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.139
 but these hackers will not let me in 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.139
 so fast 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.870
 spyro the year of the dragon 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.860
 as you can see the trick works is a 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.880
 recent trick that has been coming out 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.330
 by youtube 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.000
 I do not think they find many videos 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.340
 but if you have any doubt how 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.699
 the game works or how the 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.699
 trick 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:29.389
 if they do not know where the 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.370
 Manual buttons to access for 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:33.169
 trick the console even if you turn the 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.629
 disk while the lid is open I 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:38.259
 can I can give you some pictures if 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:38.259
 is that they want it 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.590
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.590

 provide another bit of information 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.500
 about how this method works 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.130
 remember is a pirate game is not a 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.130
 burned game 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.669
