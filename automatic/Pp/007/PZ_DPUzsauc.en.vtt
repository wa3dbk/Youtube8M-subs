gray<00:00:22.980> really<00:00:23.820> nice<00:00:24.090> finish<00:00:24.480> though<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> one

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
gray really nice finish though this one

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.830 
gray really nice finish though this one
is<00:00:25.980> made<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.189> SEM<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> designed<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.510> outside

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
is made by SEM is designed to be outside

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
is made by SEM is designed to be outside
so<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> has<00:00:28.439> UV<00:00:29.400> inhibitors<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.240> not

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
so it has UV inhibitors so it's not

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.580 
so it has UV inhibitors so it's not
going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> fade<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> lot<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.470> the

well just a really nice Bronco just
threw<00:01:33.670> out<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:34.180> has<00:01:34.330> an<00:01:34.450> excellent<00:01:34.840> running

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
threw out it has an excellent running

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.120 
threw out it has an excellent running
302

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
302

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.950 
302
this<00:01:36.460> one's<00:01:36.670> been<00:01:36.820> built<00:01:37.120> it<00:01:37.450> has<00:01:37.660> higher

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
this one's been built it has higher

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.390 
this one's been built it has higher
compression<00:01:38.470> so<00:01:38.800> we're<00:01:38.950> probably<00:01:39.310> right

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
compression so we're probably right

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.340 
compression so we're probably right
around<00:01:39.490> like<00:01:39.700> 10<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.060> half<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.420> 1<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.290> you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
around like 10 and a half to 1 so you

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.200 
around like 10 and a half to 1 so you
will<00:01:41.740> need<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.010> run<00:01:42.130> premium<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.910> but<00:01:43.060> it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
will need to run premium in it but it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.420 
will need to run premium in it but it
makes<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.660> ton<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.200> difference<00:01:44.890> on<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.250> power

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
makes a ton of difference on the power

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.180 
makes a ton of difference on the power
is<00:01:45.729> huge<00:01:46.410> torque<00:01:47.410> just<00:01:47.800> everywhere

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
is huge torque just everywhere

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.490 
is huge torque just everywhere
especially<00:01:48.310> with<00:01:48.790> those<00:01:48.970> 35<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.470> a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
especially with those 35 and it is a

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.160 
especially with those 35 and it is a
freeway<00:01:51.250> friendly<00:01:51.729> gear<00:01:52.090> too<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:52.990> can

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
freeway friendly gear too so you can

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.780 
freeway friendly gear too so you can
drive<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.530> one<00:01:53.710> anyway

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
drive this one anyway

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.670 
drive this one anyway
kind<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.810> going<00:01:55.990> around<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.440> can<00:01:56.560> see

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
kind of going around it you can see

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.550 
kind of going around it you can see

those 35 inch fuel wheel as tires on

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.710 
those 35 inch fuel wheel as tires on
there<00:01:59.770> there's<00:01:59.979> 17<00:02:00.670> inch<00:02:00.790> wheels<00:02:01.000> 35<00:02:01.540> inch

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.800 
mean just tons of stuff that it's doing
this<00:02:10.989> one<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:12.760> walk<00:02:12.970> around<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.330> back<00:02:13.540> here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
this one will walk around the back here

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.290 
this one will walk around the back here
too<00:02:14.020> you'll<00:02:14.380> be<00:02:14.500> able<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.830> see<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.270> some<00:02:16.270> of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
too you'll be able to see the some of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.110 
too you'll be able to see the some of
the<00:02:16.420> other<00:02:16.540> editions<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.830> has<00:02:17.950> LED<00:02:18.550> taillights

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the other editions it has LED taillights

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.060 
the other editions it has LED taillights
so<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.720> panel<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.140> an<00:02:20.260> LED<00:02:20.560> setup<00:02:20.920> they're

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
so the panel is an LED setup they're

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.699 
so the panel is an LED setup they're
very<00:02:21.489> bright<00:02:21.959> light<00:02:22.959> bar<00:02:23.170> makes<00:02:23.380> them<00:02:23.530> seem

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
very bright light bar makes them seem

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.720 
very bright light bar makes them seem

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
whole floor has been lined we've got

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.200 
whole floor has been lined we've got
toms<00:03:07.320> mats<00:03:07.680> those<00:03:08.010> are<00:03:08.190> right<00:03:08.700> now<00:03:08.820> we've<00:03:09.030> got

toms mats those are right now we've got

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.730 
toms mats those are right now we've got
plastic<00:03:09.630> over<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> top<00:03:10.020> of<00:03:10.050> them<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.560> won't

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
plastic over the top of them so we won't

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.800 
plastic over the top of them so we won't
ruin<00:03:10.950> them<00:03:11.070> why<00:03:11.190> we're<00:03:11.340> doing<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.810> nice

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
ruin them why we're doing this nice

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.090 
ruin them why we're doing this nice
stereo<00:03:13.140> system<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.190> touchscreen<00:03:14.520> setup

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.790 

so<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:21.390> comes<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.750> life<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.470> one<00:03:22.650> actually

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
so it comes to life so this one actually

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.470 
so it comes to life so this one actually
does<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.390> DVD<00:03:24.390> set<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.150> he

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
does a DVD set up in it so you can he

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.880 
does a DVD set up in it so you can he
could<00:03:27.630> really<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.080> lot<00:03:28.320> with<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.710> as<00:03:28.830> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
could really do a lot with this one as a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.970 
could really do a lot with this one as a
backup<00:03:29.430> camera<00:03:30.050> setup<00:03:31.050> for<00:03:31.200> navigation<00:03:31.830> so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
backup camera setup for navigation so

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.140 
backup camera setup for navigation so
you<00:03:32.040> basically<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> chip<00:03:33.000> to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
you basically just have the chip to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.790 
you basically just have the chip to
where<00:03:33.270> you're<00:03:33.390> at<00:03:33.570> navigate<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:34.500> yeah<00:03:34.620> that's
