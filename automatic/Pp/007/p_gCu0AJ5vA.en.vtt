00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.450
 Well, actually everything else is already 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 details of the classic jacket that is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.700
 if you simplify the blazer is a blue jacket 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.700
 with brass buttons 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.220
 as a blazer we choose and in general what 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.760
 should appear in men earlier bright 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.280
 le baiser 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 blazer yacht you do not need if he 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.739
 the main thing is up when choosing a blazer we have to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 pay attention to the same in principle 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.840
 the rule is just like when choosing the usual 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.630
 jacket 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.820
 This of course landing shoulders this one of 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.400
 the most important parts since you can 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.500
 cut off pockets change their ears are pounding 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.620
 but the shoulder lines are almost correct 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.620
 is impossible 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.380
 The following criteria is the length of the cuff 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.500
 principle as in a classic jacket 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.140
 cuffs should peek at 24 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.420
 a centimeter and a half from under the blazer but 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.670
 there is one very small detail and very 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.750
 it is important your blazer should cover 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.550
