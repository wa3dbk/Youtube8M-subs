00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
partner or you could just program the AI

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.150

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.750 
to do a specific move but a human
partner<00:00:37.550> would<00:00:37.670> be<00:00:37.699> easier<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.610> how<00:00:40.610> do<00:00:40.670> you

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
partner would be easier and how do you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.189 
partner would be easier and how do you
do<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:40.910> little<00:00:41.180> parry<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:41.720> it's<00:00:41.870> pretty<00:00:41.989> much

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
do a little parry so it's pretty much

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.470 
do a little parry so it's pretty much
down<00:00:42.500> forward<00:00:43.010> that's<00:00:43.760> pretty<00:00:43.970> much<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:44.239> time

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
down forward that's pretty much it time

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.180 
down forward that's pretty much it time
time<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.170> with<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.379> attack<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.949> then<00:00:46.040> you

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
time it with the attack and then you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.220 
time it with the attack and then you
should<00:00:46.280> be<00:00:46.430> good<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.699> go<00:00:46.730> with<00:00:46.970> that<00:00:47.050> do<00:00:48.050> that

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
should be good to go with that do that
