00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
Boyd um you know I think it's it's a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.780 
Boyd um you know I think it's it's a
different<00:01:57.329> sort<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> four<00:01:57.810> star<00:01:58.049> trek<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.759> do<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
different sort of four star trek to do a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.870 
different sort of four star trek to do a
burly<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.509> Kentucky<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.520> very<00:02:02.520> technical

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
burly or Kentucky it's a very technical

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.910 
burly or Kentucky it's a very technical
there's<00:02:03.390> probably<00:02:03.689> six<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.110> seven<00:02:04.409> corners

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there's probably six or seven corners

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
there's probably six or seven corners
and<00:02:05.100> narrows<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.820> bending<00:02:06.270> lines<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.780> stuff

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and narrows and bending lines and stuff

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
and narrows and bending lines and stuff
like<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like that so I think see a lot of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.449 
like that so I think see a lot of
run-outs<00:02:08.849> tomorrow<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> twisty

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
