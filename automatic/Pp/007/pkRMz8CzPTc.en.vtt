let's<00:00:02.790> say<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.090> need<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.720> print<00:00:03.930> reams<00:00:04.319> and

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649 
let's say you need to print reams and

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.520 
let's say you need to print reams and
reams<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:05.900> full-color<00:00:06.900> documents<00:00:09.110> how<00:00:10.110> would

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
reams of full-color documents how would

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.589 
reams of full-color documents how would
you<00:00:10.710> print<00:00:10.889> them<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.790> couldn't<00:00:12.090> use<00:00:12.420> an

you print them you couldn't use an
inkjet<00:00:12.900> printer<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.800> too<00:00:14.219> slow<00:00:14.550> and<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
inkjet printer it is too slow and the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.900 
inkjet printer it is too slow and the
cartridges<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.960> expensive<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.160> would<00:00:17.700> use

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
cartridges are expensive you would use

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.929 
cartridges are expensive you would use

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the state-of-the-art color copier so

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.139 
the state-of-the-art color copier so
pretty<00:00:21.450> so<00:00:22.079> fast<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.040> you<00:00:23.340> would<00:00:23.520> point<00:00:23.849> and

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
pretty so fast and you would point and

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.540 
pretty so fast and you would point and
