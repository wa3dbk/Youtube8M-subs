as<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> c6<00:01:06.270> d<00:01:07.110> 7<00:01:07.409> flat<00:01:07.590> 5<00:01:07.619> D<00:01:08.549> 6<00:01:08.840> g<00:01:09.840> 6<00:01:10.250> now<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
as a c6 d 7 flat 5 D 6 g 6 now like to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120 
as a c6 d 7 flat 5 D 6 g 6 now like to
use<00:01:11.850> Y<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> c6<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> minus<00:01:13.830> seven

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
use Y to look at the c6 is a minus seven

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580 
use Y to look at the c6 is a minus seven
you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> look<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.939> minus<00:01:15.600> seven<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> c6

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you can look at a a minus seven as a c6

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
you can look at a a minus seven as a c6
and<00:01:16.740> vice<00:01:16.950> versa<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.640> idea<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.120> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and vice versa but the idea is that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
and vice versa but the idea is that
you've<00:01:18.510> been<00:01:18.540> practicing<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> different

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you've been practicing all the different

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
you've been practicing all the different
inversion<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.940> six<00:01:21.210> chord<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:22.050> when<00:01:22.200> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
inversion of the six chord so when you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.570 
inversion of the six chord so when you
practice<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.800> different<00:01:23.160> versions<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
practice all different versions of the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
practice all different versions of the
six<00:01:23.850> cause<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.470> different

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
six cause you have all the different

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.220 
six cause you have all the different
conversion<00:01:26.370> of<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.760> court<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.900> court

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
conversion of this court and this court

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.750 
conversion of this court and this court
also<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.010> it's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.190> shortcut

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
also so it's a shortcut

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.000 
also so it's a shortcut
let's<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> guitar<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.560> play<00:01:31.830> this

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
let's go to the guitar and play this

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.340 
let's go to the guitar and play this
progression<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> play<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
progression so we're going to play a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.340 
progression so we're going to play a
minus<00:01:37.830> seven<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.340> d7<00:01:38.820> flat<00:01:39.000> five<00:01:39.480> to<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> diamond

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
minus seven to d7 flat five to a diamond

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:54.210 
minus seven to d7 flat five to a diamond
major<00:01:40.590> nine<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> g6<00:01:41.730> sound<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.659> this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.280
