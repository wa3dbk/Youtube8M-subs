in<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.890> video<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.550> will<00:00:02.730> discuss<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.389> weapons

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
in this video I will discuss the weapons

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.780 
in this video I will discuss the weapons
and<00:00:03.959> battle<00:00:04.319> tactics<00:00:04.770> commonly<00:00:05.310> used<00:00:05.580> by

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
and battle tactics commonly used by

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.820 
and battle tactics commonly used by
soldiers<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.660> Revolutionary<00:00:07.319> War<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
soldiers in the Revolutionary War the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.280 
soldiers in the Revolutionary War the
most<00:00:08.610> common<00:00:09.000> weapon<00:00:09.179> used<00:00:09.690> during<00:00:10.200> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
most common weapon used during the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.870 
most common weapon used during the
Revolutionary<00:00:10.889> period<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
Revolutionary period was the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.930 
Revolutionary period was the
muzzleloading<00:00:12.599> flintlock<00:00:13.410> musket<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.730> was

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
muzzleloading flintlock musket this was

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
muzzleloading flintlock musket this was
a<00:00:14.969> smoothbore<00:00:15.690> weapon<00:00:15.859> meaning<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> had

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
a smoothbore weapon meaning that it had

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.599 
a smoothbore weapon meaning that it had
no<00:00:17.640> rifling<00:00:18.240> or<00:00:18.750> spiral<00:00:19.380> grooves<00:00:19.710> cut<00:00:20.430> down

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
no rifling or spiral grooves cut down

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.480 
no rifling or spiral grooves cut down
the<00:00:20.760> barrel<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> improve<00:00:21.510> accuracy

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
the barrel to improve accuracy

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.099 
the barrel to improve accuracy
therefore<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> musket<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.210> accurate<00:00:24.750> only

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
therefore the musket was accurate only

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.179 
therefore the musket was accurate only
to<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> distance<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.920> around<00:00:26.220> 75<00:00:26.730> yards<00:00:27.330> or<00:00:27.449> less

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
to a distance of around 75 yards or less

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.250 
to a distance of around 75 yards or less
the<00:00:29.189> British<00:00:29.519> musket<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:30.060> typically<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> 75

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the British musket was typically a 75

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.250 
the British musket was typically a 75
caliber<00:00:31.740> gun<00:00:31.949> firing<00:00:32.910> 69<00:00:33.510> caliber<00:00:33.840> balls

caliber gun firing 69 caliber balls

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
caliber gun firing 69 caliber balls
while<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> American<00:00:35.820> musket<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.300> typically

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
while the American musket was typically

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.369 
while the American musket was typically
smaller<00:00:37.129> usually<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> 69<00:00:38.940> caliber<00:00:39.210> gun<00:00:39.600> firing

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
smaller usually a 69 caliber gun firing

smaller usually a 69 caliber gun firing
65<00:00:40.950> caliber<00:00:41.430> balls<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.030> both<00:00:42.960> cases<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.860> shot

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
65 caliber balls in both cases the shot

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
65 caliber balls in both cases the shot
fired<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.730> smaller<00:00:45.000> than<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> barrel

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
fired was smaller than the barrel

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.170 
fired was smaller than the barrel
because<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> Saudi<00:00:46.890> residue<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.969> black

because of the Saudi residue that black

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.170 
because of the Saudi residue that black
powder<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.690> leave<00:00:48.870> inside<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> gun<00:00:50.180> both
