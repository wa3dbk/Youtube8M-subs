00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 and so this time we will try to hold 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.490
 a reaction called rubber 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.190
 egg a lot already who did not know but still I 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.380
 I will tell you again 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.160
 who will need vinegar beauty face 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.060
 and small in each case we have 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.119
 instant glass pour small 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 the amount of acetic acid in cups 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.719
 and put there an egg immediately noticeable 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.210
 small bubbles are small 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.090
 carbon dioxide bubbles due to the fact 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.899
 what is bought up mostly consists of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.989
 calcium carbonate which reacts with 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.090
 acetic acid and with release 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 carbon dioxide that 's more more 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 bubbles observed on the surface 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 eggs soon the shell should dissolve 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:07.619
 leaving only the content itself and protective 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.270
 plenochka around the contents it will be 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.760
 how how would a rubber well this not 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.159
 is really so here later 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.750
 about 3 hours 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.970
 I will say a finger rises so just 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.830
 you can just 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.380
 chop up with your fingers but what about you 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.829
 fingers all the same it is not fingers all the same 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.710
 Better Wali option so it is best to wear 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.470
 gloves so as not to damage the acid all 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 Equally, it is not as streaming and what's special 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 there is nothing dangerous 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.020
 12 hours later, our shell is completely 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.810
 dissolved and we got it 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.920
 as if a rubber egg, I will now experience 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.750
 bath but do not, I'm telling you this is not 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.160
 rubber egg it just might burst 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 see how we have this case 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.940
 although it can withstand pretty 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.620
 hard knocks and 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.850
 rolls cool from the surface and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.850
 that's alcohol bounce
