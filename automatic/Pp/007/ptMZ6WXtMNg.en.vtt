subversion is something subversive game
design<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.640> concept<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.629> we've<00:00:06.870> been

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
design is a concept that we've been

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.379 
design is a concept that we've been
working<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.470> here<00:00:07.620> for<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.130> few<00:00:08.639> years<00:00:08.700> now<00:00:08.970> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
working on here for a few years now and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.650 
working on here for a few years now and
the<00:00:09.510> idea<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.110> subvert<00:00:11.179> to<00:00:12.179> challenge

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the idea is to subvert to challenge

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.650 
the idea is to subvert to challenge
expectations<00:00:13.469> pretty<00:00:13.769> much<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.509> are

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
expectations pretty much so we are

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.380 
expectations pretty much so we are
trying<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.320> design<00:00:16.650> games<00:00:16.730> that<00:00:17.730> play<00:00:17.970> with

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
trying to design games that play with

trying to design games that play with
the<00:00:18.779> way<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.020> anticipate<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.220> way<00:00:20.340> you

the way you anticipate the way you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.960 
the way you anticipate the way you
approach<00:00:21.240> life<00:00:21.350> or<00:00:22.350> games<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.920> general<00:00:22.970> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
general plot is two players are managing

lava sprites in the center of the earth
each<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.720> them<00:00:30.960> each<00:00:31.260> player<00:00:31.470> has

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
each one of them each player has

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.090 
each one of them each player has

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
different goals and common goal as well

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
different goals and common goal as well
both<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.790> them<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> earth<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> turn<00:00:37.110> at

both of them want the earth to turn at

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
both of them want the earth to turn at
the<00:00:37.410> proper<00:00:37.710> speed<00:00:38.090> player<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.390> wants<00:00:39.870> the

the proper speed player one wants the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.600 
the proper speed player one wants the
temperature<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> machine<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> run<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.460> hot

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
temperature of the machine to run as hot

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.979 
temperature of the machine to run as hot
as<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> machine<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.899> as

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
as it can so the machine is as as

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
as it can so the machine is as as
efficient<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.379> possible<00:00:43.910> player<00:00:44.910> two<00:00:45.149> wants

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
efficient as possible player two wants

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.970 
efficient as possible player two wants
his<00:00:45.690> workers<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.620> happy<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
his workers to be happy and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.400 
his workers to be happy and
communicating<00:00:47.730> well<00:00:47.989> wants<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.200> badges

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
communicating well wants to get badges

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.220 
communicating well wants to get badges
for<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.329> each<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> common<00:00:52.199> goal

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
for that so they each have a common goal

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670 
for that so they each have a common goal
as<00:00:52.559> well<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.870> individual<00:00:55.440> goal

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
as well as a you know individual goal

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.770 
as well as a you know individual goal
and<00:00:55.980> neither<00:00:56.399> player<00:00:56.760> knows<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> other

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and neither player knows what the other

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.619 
and neither player knows what the other
players<00:00:58.020> individual<00:00:58.920> goal<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.120> question

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
players individual goal is the question

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
players individual goal is the question
what<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> game<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.199> was<00:01:01.680> really

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
what the game is about was really

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.700 
what the game is about was really
essential<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:02.910> us<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.930> topic<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.470> chose

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
essential for us and the topic we chose

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.920 
essential for us and the topic we chose
for<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.460> work<00:01:06.150> environment<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
for the game is work environment and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
for the game is work environment and
work<00:01:07.110> ethics<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.010> especially<00:01:08.820> we're

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
work ethics so especially we're

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.140 
work ethics so especially we're
interested<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:11.040> real<00:01:11.400> life<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.909> work

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
interested in how in real life in work

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
interested in how in real life in work
environments<00:01:12.750> different<00:01:13.130> perspectives

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
environments different perspectives

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.880 
environments different perspectives
collide<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.560> manager<00:01:16.560> might<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
collide so a manager might have a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
collide so a manager might have a
different<00:01:17.100> perspective<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.970> workers<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
different perspective on workers and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.770 
different perspective on workers and
then<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> CEO<00:01:19.619> has<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.420> probably<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> worker

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
then the CEO has or probably the worker

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440 
then the CEO has or probably the worker
him<00:01:22.259> or<00:01:22.380> herself<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.700> general<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.210> away

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
him or herself so the general take away

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.980 
him or herself so the general take away
would<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.430> not<00:01:26.430> necessarily<00:01:26.750> educate<00:01:27.750> them

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
would be to not necessarily educate them

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810 
would be to not necessarily educate them
about<00:01:28.110> every<00:01:28.650> single<00:01:28.860> aspect<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.579> worker

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
about every single aspect of worker

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
about every single aspect of worker
environment<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.290> workers<00:01:31.619> communicate

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
environment and how workers communicate

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640 
environment and how workers communicate
but<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> give<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.810> poke<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> little

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
but to give that little poke that little

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
but to give that little poke that little
nudge<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.400> takes<00:01:35.640> fourth<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.720> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
nudge for them takes fourth so what we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
nudge for them takes fourth so what we
are<00:01:37.290> interested<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.740> studying<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.700> other

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
are interested in studying is how other

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.300 
are interested in studying is how other
players<00:01:39.119> playing<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> game<00:01:39.930> how<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:41.100> they

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
players playing the game how are they

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310 
players playing the game how are they
interacting<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:43.049> form<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
interacting and what form of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.710 
interacting and what form of
communication<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> game

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
communication is going on in the game

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.139 
communication is going on in the game
between<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.530> maybe<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:48.090> does

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
between them or maybe not and how does

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.510 
between them or maybe not and how does
it<00:01:48.270> impact<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> takeaway<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
it impact them is there a takeaway can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
it impact them is there a takeaway can
they<00:01:50.640> read<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.350> very

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
they read it and I think what is very

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
they read it and I think what is very
important<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> us<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.149> think

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
important to us is that I think

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
important to us is that I think
educational<00:01:55.229> game<00:01:55.380> experiences<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.100> never

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
educational game experiences can never

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
educational game experiences can never
be<00:01:56.700> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> solitude<00:01:57.689> experience<00:01:58.409> so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
very interesting to see that they can be

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.850 
very interesting to see that they can be
good<00:02:13.600> they<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.110> be<00:02:14.230> fun<00:02:14.380> they<00:02:14.620> can<00:02:14.740> be

good they can be fun they can be

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.820 
good they can be fun they can be
interesting<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.880> normal<00:02:16.300> game<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
interesting just like a normal game so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.070 
interesting just like a normal game so
we<00:02:18.670> worked<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.120> subversive<00:02:19.480> game<00:02:19.810> design

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
we worked on subversive game design

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.870 
we worked on subversive game design
before<00:02:20.230> there's<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.920> lot<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.130> work<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.550> serious

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
before there's a lot of work on serious

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.770 
before there's a lot of work on serious
games<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.410> try<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> combine<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:25.090> serious

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
games but we try to combine a serious

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.890 
games but we try to combine a serious
game<00:02:26.020> with<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> idea<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.400> social<00:02:27.850> two<00:02:28.660> player

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
game with the idea of social two player

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.820 
game with the idea of social two player
interaction<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.830> also<00:02:31.380> subversiveness<00:02:32.380> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
interaction and also subversiveness and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
interaction and also subversiveness and
kind<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.069> like<00:02:33.190> challenging<00:02:33.810> expectations<00:02:34.810> so

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
kind of like challenging expectations so

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.600 
kind of like challenging expectations so
the<00:02:35.260> combination<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.800> all<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.520> a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the combination of all of that in a

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.729 
the combination of all of that in a
tablet<00:02:36.940> game<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.480> play<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.690> tablet<00:02:38.050> game<00:02:38.230> is

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
tablet game to play a tablet game is

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.949 
tablet game to play a tablet game is
pretty<00:02:39.010> unique<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:40.420> are<00:02:40.480> no<00:02:40.570> games<00:02:40.750> out

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
pretty unique and there are no games out

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.400 
pretty unique and there are no games out
there<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.320> do<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.620> yet<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.959> my<00:02:44.110> research

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
there that do that yet so it my research

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.259 
there that do that yet so it my research
it<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.800> two<00:02:45.340> things<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.700> work<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:45.970> theoretical

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
it to two things I work on theoretical

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.000 
it to two things I work on theoretical
concepts<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:46.989> I'm<00:02:47.110> also<00:02:47.260> very<00:02:47.440> interested<00:02:47.650> in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
concepts but I'm also very interested in

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.820 
concepts but I'm also very interested in
play<00:02:48.160> experiences<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.000> design<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.709> this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
play experiences and design and in this

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.770 
play experiences and design and in this
project<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.489> all<00:02:51.610> about<00:02:51.820> design<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
project it was all about design and the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.020 
project it was all about design and the
question<00:02:53.140> was<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.709> we<00:02:53.769> design<00:02:54.550> and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
question was can we design and

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.229 
question was can we design and
experience<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.260> purposeful<00:02:57.010> experience<00:02:57.489> that

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
experience a purposeful experience that

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.520 
experience a purposeful experience that
allows<00:02:59.170> people<00:02:59.560> to<00:03:00.239> challenge<00:03:01.239> different

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
allows people to challenge different

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.060 
allows people to challenge different
perspectives<00:03:02.530> about<00:03:02.880> an<00:03:03.880> issue
