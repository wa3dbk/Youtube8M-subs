00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 and so proceed to step number 9 build 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.139
 striped parts that is, we need the bottom 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.240
 and from above collect the striped part here 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 we got a marshmallow 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 how we will do it in advance 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.350
 tick inserted thread of primary color 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 pretty long no big deal 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.890
 I do not mind the main thing to understand 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.110
 how many times do not repeat it and start 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.640
 inject a needle 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:47.480
 between the strings we need to collect by 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.860
 top so edging ie we 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 we collect loops we insert a needle 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 between the edge and the first loop so 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 way over and over doing stretching 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.430
 thread we do not tie but leave 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.750
 long tip to end it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.909
 pull out and then tie up and just when 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.299
 not suffer no few nodules 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.299
 do 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.280
 I often do to our assembly 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.280
 it turned out good 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 here even by touch is no longer. herself goes 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 Needle with the right place 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.140
 the main thing is not to thread a needle into the thread itself 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.180
 since then the assembly will be 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:09.760
 problematic it will be easier to cut them 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.760
 pull this thread out somehow 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.060
 here inside 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.710
 what we got now we take not 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.710
 delaying 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.049
 so it's better to turn this whole thing out 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.219
 back side 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.219
 it will be more convenient 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 where 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.470
 I do not tie a doll out 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.450
 but do not overdo it because the needle 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:06.549
 it may not be completely broken 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:13.239
 good 2 knot and rub it too 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:16.889
 probably so tied then we have now 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.889
 there we see 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.300
 bakery products 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.300
 will cut us off 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.780
 collected from above now need to cut off yet 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:45.120
 the thread of the primary color and in the same way 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.120
 collect marshmallow bottom 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:55.330
 again turn the leg on the left 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:05:00.660
 side starts to build 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.660
 from here in a circle to here 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.240
 now need to collect 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.160
 the bottom of this striped 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.330
 pre fact the thread bun 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.010
 about the same length and start the same 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.310
 way as up was collected between 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:26.970
 Edge and loop we put between 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.970
 the strings between the strings of the sweater 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.380
 grater bark 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.779
 continue 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.650
 also to needle us between the strings 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.650
 It was 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.700
 styles 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:43.729
 stretch to. - shorter 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.729
 way and we 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:07:05.390
 we also tie knots better 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:07.540
 we tighten several knots on two on 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.540
 three 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.800
 creed 3 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.800
 this thread is not cut off 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.759
 because we will need to finish 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:28.990
 the thread is this sole here 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:28.990
 it turns out further
