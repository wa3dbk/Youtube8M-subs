 all healthy today, things will go on baxi 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.080
 this tank initiator aggressor is very strong 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.000
 at the beginning of the game does not deliver any 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.740
 the pleasures of the enemy are on the line and very 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.359
 charismatic average gain of power 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.160
 average so much armor but little 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.419
 health is very little intelligence that 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.789
 unsurprisingly people with such appearance 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.710
 with skills which is much more interesting 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.419
 first ability berserk sands 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.839
 makes all nearby enemies beat 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.029
 Aksa 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.620
 that for the duration of the action get 40 armor 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.750
 if skill can knock down any 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.100
 interrupted ability to also stop 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.090
 fleeing enemy but need to be considered

 small radius 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.620
 battle hunger nicknamed chest burner 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.660
 rushes to the enemies the light that waits for them 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.740
 pc and increases our sbega which 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.900
 can add up for each 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.600
 defeated enemy that can lose 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.040
 torch killing any creep or hero not 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.870
 Be sure to throw u only on heroes 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.970
 for example catching up or running away from someone 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.160
 you can simultaneously pyro side by side to 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.660
 increase our speed counter helix 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.150
 passive ability applied to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.920
 counterattack a 17 percent chance of dealing 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.929
 physical damage to all enemies small 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.329
 radius it develops no more than 

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:10.670
 three tenths of a second helix does not work 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.740
 from the siege towers in the world on 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.179
 masters or decoction davis doctor and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.939
 deals physical damage 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.270
 so it depends on the armor of the enemy 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.799
 quelling blade 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.229
 Ulta our hero inflicting big 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.789
 loss of a single target but if you target 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.890
 the health threshold below is this 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.359
 dies instantly and ags and his allies 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.850
 nearby gets tremendous speed 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.859
 run and ulta attack at the moment of impact 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.049
 react only to the enemy's hop and kill 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.579
 its based only on the equals so 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.649
 way being under omnik buffs 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.689
 cross yes for Lena bkb and ult 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.920
 abbadona he could still die if 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.659
 about health below the required storyteller 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.310
 for this hero a great many and here 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.200
 as you already understood it all depends on the characters 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.609
 with whom you play talk about 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.310
 any specific dick assembly not 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.389
 get one say tank initiator in 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.219
 rare cases of killer 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:57.229
 better pumping for this aggressor 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.090
 not all stages displayed 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.219
 Stencil for example ultu can not 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.539
 download at the tenth level of high costs 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.579
 mana will force constantly 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.770
 recharge beads digging on 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.599
 the unit no longer needs main focus 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.099
 on philips but if the enemy keeps you on 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.860
 there should be no distance 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.270
 either drink and burner initial purchase two 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.590
 shield and tango and if 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.230
 not satisfied with this scheme is here 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.270
 alternative then buy 8k 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.250
 try to kill if we kill buy 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.130
 Tranquillo if we pitted kopim 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 further tar or hood vangvard 1 against 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.330
 mage 2 against physical damage but van 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.060
 guard gives legal right to farm ents 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.130
 Okud more calculated on the ganges later 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.380
 you should fuck both of these hunts 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.120
 turn into pipe when they start 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.130
 bulk dough we should have a blade 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.660
 mail in any build is one of the most 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.710
 important items we are now torezÃ© on 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.300
 ravel a blade mail 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.820
 increases our audacity in a few 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.890
 once and of course there are all builds 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.420
 blink dagger surely is perfect for 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.960
 initiation but do you have 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.000
 tore up 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.130
 then i'm more inclined towards the killer with the south 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.960
 smash will help to come close to any 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.580
 enemy other characteristics only from 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.770
 we lack mana and gives a great 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.630
 speed but blink is necessary 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.330
 if your team needs initiator 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.070
 and if all is well with the regeneration we buy 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.020
 soul ring and get a bunch of free 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.790
 mana at the same price at will we take 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.100
 medallion that lowers the enemies armor 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.290
 as you remember counter helix physical 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.270
 halberd damage is able to turn off strong 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.670
 carry and even the prize works us dodging 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.650
 helix will work perfectly against 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.290
 strong dealers are not very desirable but 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.660
 can dagon necronomicon for push and 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.880
 midas such a thing as we drive in general 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.560
 I do not advise buying useless 6 seconds 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.320
 and the health threshold increases by only 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.690
 175 for me so much more efficiently Dagon 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.310
 take aganim only to increase 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.590
 acceleration duration for 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.560
 allies naturally and now let's talk 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 about shiva and u recommend almost everywhere but she 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.610
 gives us the intelligence and auras we need 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.720
 slow down attack speed i mean less 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.760
 enemy attack speed 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.040
 counter helix does not work out less often 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.560
 we take and if you really want coins 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.170
 remove the table and it's not like that 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.120
 and a lot of items are going to aksu on 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.250
 lines should be heated to enter creeps 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.870
 Without heroes Aksu, the mice are not so terrible and 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.760
 like others, but don't go under them 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.860
 if enemies have camp or slowdown 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.630
 the meaning of this tactic is simple blame 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.420
 enemies from creeps and throw the torch down 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.950
 which they can't all just took 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.930
 try to pour a bunch of creeps and 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.880
 opponents berserk then he for sure 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.370
 will die a4 alex f and a few blows 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.470
 it is important that the creeps beat you 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.840
 your mate need more and more 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.970
 beat and finally tactics which for 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.860
 many will not be unexpected to go 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.629
 to enemies between the higher ones above or 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.300
 and farm at a tremendous speed of mushrooms 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:34.159
 also quickly carried the towers but not 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.050
 kill creeps immediately with them 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.389
 attack heroes or take them along course 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.099
 is that the enemies do not get you if 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.139
 you chose a similar tactic then with such 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.330
 enemies on the line like clinkz rubik or 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.189
 crap cancer it would be unreasonably perfect 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.810
 enemies strong carry is not capable of anything 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.939
 do at the beginning of the game and not having 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.340
 long be perfect allies 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.990
 Carries Baines to Dark Sir Jakiro or 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.759
 shaker as well as any other heroes 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.189
 able for a long time and stop the enemies 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 and helps us escape or survive 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.919
 initially 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.270
 not to make a mistake and get on the line 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.909
 look exactly at creeps 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.409
 opposite line creep position 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.389
 symmetrical with respect to the opposite 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.340
 sides and if your creeps are on top of mind that 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.800
 the second tower and the enemy is also a 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.529
 stand and wait for the screams there is dangerous and stupid 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.569
 but difficult but most effective to take 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.819
 creeps to the forest about you but so that you 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.009
 Do not you and creeps while Rick you 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.319
 must beat you so you raise the experience and 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.029
 gold as quickly as possible fungi 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.409
 can be diverted from other lines but 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.479
 don't stay there for long 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.009
 a small distance between the towers can 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.830
 play a very bad role for like 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.169
 tactics well, and in the end a little candy 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.879
 axel he is against physical damageers on 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.159
 weak against magicians especially all that 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.349
 can steal mana and ally well 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.389
 the scene will fall and the recovery boiler 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.430
 mana omnica as a portable abacaba i 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.919
 Dazzle lowering armor and nakir which 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.960
 generally universal in other words all 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.569
 heroes reinforcing our weak and strong 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.310
 parties and yes it is very undesirable to see 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.139
 opponents of our beloved allies 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.930
 all these heroes lower our 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.520
 maneuverability which we really need and 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.379
 write on this in the comments 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.300
 what mistakes do you want me to correct 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.979
 and i also what heroes do you want 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.419
 see the next guide and I am with you 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.419
 I say goodbye to all the best!
