just<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.670> glider<00:04:52.970> pack<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.930> guess<00:04:54.500> you

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
just a glider pack so I guess you

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.250 
just a glider pack so I guess you
couldn't<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:55.190> have<00:04:56.060> multiple<00:04:56.780> glider<00:04:57.050> packs

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
couldn't I have multiple glider packs

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.390 
couldn't I have multiple glider packs
like<00:04:57.380> this<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.680> put<00:04:57.800> them<00:04:57.860> on<00:04:58.010> different

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
like this and put them on different

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.280 
like this and put them on different
figures<00:04:58.760> uh<00:04:58.790> depending<00:04:59.330> if<00:04:59.450> their<00:04:59.660> figures

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
figures uh depending if their figures

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.100 
figures uh depending if their figures
hands<00:05:00.530> could<00:05:00.800> go<00:05:01.640> around<00:05:01.730> this<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:02.840> they<00:05:02.960> could

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
hands could go around this so they could

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.890 
hands could go around this so they could
actually<00:05:03.200> hold<00:05:03.470> on<00:05:03.820> things<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:04.940> just<00:05:05.090> folds

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
actually hold on things that just folds

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:19.030 
actually hold on things that just folds
up<00:05:06.050> back<00:05:06.380> thank<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:17.530> pretty<00:05:18.530> interesting

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.030 
exclusive Ian Malcolm just having this
glider<00:05:37.280> pack<00:05:37.520> alone<00:05:37.790> is<00:05:37.970> kind<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.240> cool

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
glider pack alone is kind of cool

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.010 
glider pack alone is kind of cool
because<00:05:40.040> uh<00:05:40.190> maybe<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.120> would<00:05:41.210> be<00:05:41.330> worked<00:05:41.810> on

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
because uh maybe it would be worked on

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.280 
because uh maybe it would be worked on
some<00:05:42.230> other<00:05:42.440> figures<00:05:43.780> collapse<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:45.050> wings

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
some other figures collapse the wings

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.950 
some other figures collapse the wings
back<00:05:45.650> down<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.370> fold<00:05:46.730> them<00:05:46.910> in<00:05:47.060> it's<00:05:47.600> kind<00:05:47.870> of

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
back down and fold them in it's kind of

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.580 
back down and fold them in it's kind of
a<00:05:48.230> pain<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.740> get<00:05:49.100> it<00:05:49.250> in<00:05:50.170> kind<00:05:51.170> of<00:05:51.260> a<00:05:51.380> pain<00:05:51.560> to

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
a pain to get it in kind of a pain to

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.920 
a pain to get it in kind of a pain to
get<00:05:51.920> that<00:05:52.300> collapse<00:05:53.300> back<00:05:53.630> down<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.200> stay

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
get that collapse back down and stay

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.060 
get that collapse back down and stay
these<00:05:56.930> two<00:05:57.170> little<00:05:57.440> pieces<00:05:57.470> that<00:05:57.830> are

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
these two little pieces that are

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.250 
these two little pieces that are
supposed<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.700> catch<00:05:59.000> yeah<00:05:59.540> there<00:05:59.840> we<00:05:59.930> go

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
supposed to catch yeah there we go

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.200 
supposed to catch yeah there we go
and<00:06:00.770> it's<00:06:00.890> all<00:06:01.040> hold<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:01.610> up<00:06:01.700> nicely<00:06:01.970> nice

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
and it's all hold it up nicely nice

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.440 
and it's all hold it up nicely nice
until<00:06:02.510> you<00:06:02.600> press<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.990> button<00:06:03.230> again<00:06:04.450> to

until you press the button again to

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.620 
until you press the button again to
launch<00:06:05.570> these<00:06:06.820> so<00:06:07.820> almost<00:06:08.090> kind<00:06:08.270> of<00:06:08.300> like<00:06:08.420> the

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
launch these so almost kind of like the

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.600 
launch these so almost kind of like the
wing<00:06:09.080> flapping<00:06:09.410> action<00:06:09.800> from<00:06:09.920> steel<00:06:10.220> began

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
the cat squad Alice Fire beak a little

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.790 
the cat squad Alice Fire beak a little
bit<00:06:13.130> if<00:06:13.310> you<00:06:13.430> ask<00:06:13.580> me

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
bit if you ask me

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.040 
bit if you ask me
and<00:06:15.800> then<00:06:16.220> yeah<00:06:16.730> there's<00:06:16.940> your<00:06:17.060> Ian<00:06:17.360> Malcolm

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.200 

if<00:06:21.050> I<00:06:21.320> had<00:06:21.500> to<00:06:21.620> rate<00:06:21.800> this<00:06:21.980> I'd<00:06:22.250> probably<00:06:22.310> give

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
if I had to rate this I'd probably give

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.110 
if I had to rate this I'd probably give
it<00:06:23.300> a<00:06:23.420> three<00:06:24.020> point<00:06:24.050> five<00:06:24.500> or<00:06:24.860> three<00:06:25.520> point<00:06:25.880> six

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
it a three point five or three point six

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.400 
it a three point five or three point six
I<00:06:26.390> would<00:06:26.540> say<00:06:28.690> just<00:06:29.690> because<00:06:29.870> of<00:06:30.050> its<00:06:30.140> from<00:06:30.260> the

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
I would say just because of its from the

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.290 
I would say just because of its from the
old<00:06:30.500> Caroline's<00:06:31.010> it's<00:06:31.220> nothing<00:06:31.490> special<00:06:31.850> but

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300
