best<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> world<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
best in the world it's like a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.310 
best in the world it's like a
combination<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> math<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.660> social<00:01:04.140> studies

combination of math and social studies

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
combination of math and social studies
you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.010> incorporate<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.790> old

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you can incorporate like old

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
you can incorporate like old
mathematical<00:01:06.689> values<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.710> history

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
mathematical values into like history

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
mathematical values into like history
Physiology<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.060> even<00:01:09.479> psychology<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> think

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
Physiology or even psychology so I think

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.690 
Physiology or even psychology so I think
it's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.040> combination

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's a good combination

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
it's a good combination
