00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
high intensity and that doesn't mean how

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
bounties the low intensity just means

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.570 
bounties the low intensity just means
there's<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:07.770> system<00:01:08.310> authorities<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
there's more system authorities the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.770 
there's more system authorities the
medium<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.790> means<00:01:12.119> there's<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> medium

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
medium one means there's like a medium

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
before it then the high intensity means

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
before it then the high intensity means
there's<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> none<00:01:17.810> system

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
gonna go over here to the galaxy map I
don't<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.920> counts<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.400> everybody

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
don't know if this counts for everybody

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
don't know if this counts for everybody
but<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.750> had<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> buddy<00:01:43.110> start<00:01:43.409> playing

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
but I I just had a buddy start playing

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
but I I just had a buddy start playing
and<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.070> noticed<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> he<00:01:44.850> started<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and I noticed that he started in the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.330 
and I noticed that he started in the
same<00:01:46.020> system<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> did<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> care<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
same system I did which is a care of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.550 
same system I did which is a care of
eight

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.320 

and<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:51.980> I<00:01:52.010> was<00:01:52.190> looking<00:01:52.340> for<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.760> good<00:01:52.970> system

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
and so I was looking for a good system

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.990 
and so I was looking for a good system
when<00:01:53.480> I<00:01:53.510> found<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.930> tip<00:01:54.170> out<00:01:54.490> nearby<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.970> I

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
when I found this tip out nearby and I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.870 
when I found this tip out nearby and I
found<00:01:56.210> her<00:01:56.510> main<00:01:56.950> his<00:01:57.950> clothes<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.310> probably

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
found her main his clothes and probably

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.610 
found her main his clothes and probably
the<00:01:59.000> best<00:01:59.240> there's<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.720> couple<00:01:59.870> reasons<00:02:00.140> for

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
the best there's a couple reasons for

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.140 
the best there's a couple reasons for
that<00:02:00.830> if<00:02:01.370> this<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.670> where<00:02:01.850> you're<00:02:01.940> starting

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
that if this is where you're starting

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.020 
that if this is where you're starting
out<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:03.290> because<00:02:03.470> her<00:02:04.310> main<00:02:04.490> two<00:02:04.730> is

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
out and that's because her main two is

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.469 
out and that's because her main two is
not<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.480> far<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.900> trip<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.730> maybe<00:02:07.730> 500

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
not that far of a trip and maybe 500

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.930 
not that far of a trip and maybe 500
kilometers<00:02:09.020> away<00:02:09.280> or<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:10.520> can't<00:02:10.790> remember

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
kilometers away or so I can't remember

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.490 
kilometers away or so I can't remember
exactly<00:02:11.450> five<00:02:11.660> or<00:02:11.810> seven<00:02:12.050> hundred<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.350> things

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
exactly five or seven hundred I things

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.520 
exactly five or seven hundred I things
like<00:02:12.710> five<00:02:12.950> as<00:02:13.820> well<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.120> terminal<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.410> can

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
like five as well or terminal so you can

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.370 
like five as well or terminal so you can
go<00:02:15.650> here<00:02:16.010> after<00:02:16.400> your<00:02:16.490> trip<00:02:16.730> refuel<00:02:17.390> restock

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
go here after your trip refuel restock

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.960 
go here after your trip refuel restock
and<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.160> go<00:02:19.280> up<00:02:19.310> here<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.610> crow<00:02:19.760> main

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and you can go up here to crow main

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.320 
and you can go up here to crow main
around<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:21.260> ring<00:02:21.590> are<00:02:22.010> going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.880> regular

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
around this ring are going to be regular

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.140 
around this ring are going to be regular
resource<00:02:23.840> extraction<00:02:24.140> sites<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
resource extraction sites so all you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.060 
resource extraction sites so all you
have<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.360> do<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.570> head<00:02:26.720> for<00:02:26.930> those<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.440> I'll

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
have to do is head for those and I'll

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.740 
have to do is head for those and I'll
show<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.370> video<00:02:28.490> at<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.880> end<00:02:28.910> again<00:02:29.600> I'm

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
show some video at the end again I'm

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.880 
show some video at the end again I'm
just<00:02:29.900> trying<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.140> get<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.320> information<00:02:30.530> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
just trying to get the information to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.290 
just trying to get the information to
you<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.010> fast<00:02:31.220> as<00:02:31.459> possible<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.120> don't

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
you as fast as possible so you don't

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.050 
you as fast as possible so you don't
have<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.480> watch<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.720> 20<00:02:32.959> minute<00:02:33.140> long<00:02:33.260> video<00:02:34.060> but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
have to watch a 20 minute long video but

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.170 
have to watch a 20 minute long video but
when<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.020> get<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.470> drop<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.250> go<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> where

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
when you get there drop out go to where

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.310 
when you get there drop out go to where
the<00:02:38.209> resource<00:02:38.630> extraction<00:02:38.870> way<00:02:39.770> point<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
the resource extraction way point is and

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.600 
the resource extraction way point is and
start<00:02:42.320> looking<00:02:42.680> around<00:02:42.800> I'm<00:02:43.130> assuming<00:02:43.490> you

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
start looking around I'm assuming you

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.860 
start looking around I'm assuming you
know<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:43.940> going<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.270> be<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> lot<00:02:44.660> for

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
know this is going to be a lot for

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.850 
know this is going to be a lot for
beginners<00:02:45.260> you're<00:02:45.440> going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.740> in<00:02:45.800> a

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
beginners you're going to be in a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.530 
beginners you're going to be in a
sidewinder<00:02:47.709> what<00:02:48.709> i<00:02:48.740> would<00:02:49.070> do<00:02:49.220> first<00:02:49.670> is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sidewinder what i would do first is

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.360 
sidewinder what i would do first is
start<00:02:50.870> looking<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.410> other<00:02:51.440> ships<00:02:51.860> firing<00:02:52.130> on

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
start looking for other ships firing on

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.009 
start looking for other ships firing on
each<00:02:52.489> other<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.850> then<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.510> would<00:02:53.810> make<00:02:53.989> a

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
each other and then I would make a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.759 
each other and then I would make a
beeline<00:02:54.320> for<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.880> start<00:02:56.470> tabbing<00:02:57.470> through

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
beeline for it and start tabbing through

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.830 
beeline for it and start tabbing through
the<00:02:57.920> ship's<00:02:58.190> or<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.850> tabbing<00:02:59.239> but<00:02:59.390> hitting<00:02:59.600> t

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the ship's or not tabbing but hitting t

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.680 
the ship's or not tabbing but hitting t
and<00:03:00.110> going<00:03:00.260> through<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.440> ships<00:03:01.360> or<00:03:02.360> getting

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
and going through the ships or getting

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.990 
and going through the ships or getting
the<00:03:02.780> closest<00:03:03.170> threat<00:03:03.440> one<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.670> scan

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
the closest threat one and as you scan

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.030 
the closest threat one and as you scan
you'll<00:03:05.390> see<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.930> says<00:03:06.050> wanted<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.739> bottom

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
you'll see it says wanted in the bottom

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030 
you'll see it says wanted in the bottom
left<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.630> again<00:03:09.260> I'll<00:03:09.380> show<00:03:09.530> video<00:03:09.800> about

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
left and again I'll show video about

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.890 
left and again I'll show video about
that<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.430> end<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.300> once<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.630> see<00:03:11.780> it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
that in the end so once you see it's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.320 
that in the end so once you see it's
wanted<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.440> can<00:03:12.590> fire<00:03:12.800> on<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.220> if<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.120> fire<00:03:14.300> it

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
wanted you can fire on it if you fire it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.300 
wanted you can fire on it if you fire it
up<00:03:14.510> before<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.810> says<00:03:15.050> wanted<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.130> get<00:03:16.280> a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
up before it says wanted you can get a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.160 
up before it says wanted you can get a
little<00:03:16.610> one<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.880> tag<00:03:17.060> yourself<00:03:17.600> because<00:03:18.019> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
little one to tag yourself because the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.600 
little one to tag yourself because the
game<00:03:18.350> is<00:03:18.500> assuming<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.070> you're<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:19.400> firing

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
game is assuming that you're just firing

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.710 
game is assuming that you're just firing

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
thousand credits to a million here and i

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.960 
thousand credits to a million here and i
did<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.300> i<00:04:39.750> upgraded<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.919> Viper<00:04:41.130> stayed

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
did that i upgraded to the Viper stayed

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.100 
did that i upgraded to the Viper stayed
with<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.210> Viper<00:04:42.390> for<00:04:42.660> quite<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> while<00:04:43.050> and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
with the Viper for quite a while and

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.480 
with the Viper for quite a while and
then<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.500> think<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.770> actually<00:04:43.980> ended<00:04:44.310> up

cash in those bounties you will make I
think<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:32.970> made<00:05:33.180> probably<00:05:33.690> about<00:05:33.930> 500<00:05:34.200> to<00:05:34.590> 700

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
think I made probably about 500 to 700

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.480 
think I made probably about 500 to 700
thousand<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.789> that<00:05:35.940> in<00:05:36.180> maybe<00:05:36.630> 40<00:05:37.080> minutes

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
thousand of that in maybe 40 minutes

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.399 
thousand of that in maybe 40 minutes
maybe<00:05:38.490> even<00:05:38.729> more<00:05:38.850> than<00:05:38.910> that

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
maybe even more than that

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.589 
maybe even more than that
as<00:05:40.009> far<00:05:40.189> as<00:05:40.219> the<00:05:40.369> money<00:05:40.519> goes<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:41.029> did<00:05:41.179> not<00:05:41.300> take

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
as far as the money goes it did not take

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.689 
as far as the money goes it did not take
long<00:05:41.629> and<00:05:42.169> it's<00:05:42.619> just<00:05:42.800> good<00:05:43.009> way<00:05:43.189> to<00:05:43.249> really

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
long and it's just good way to really

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.869 
long and it's just good way to really
upgrade<00:05:43.909> and<00:05:44.479> start<00:05:44.959> exploring<00:05:45.639> once<00:05:46.639> you<00:05:46.729> get

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
upgrade and start exploring once you get

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.479 
upgrade and start exploring once you get
that<00:05:47.029> then<00:05:47.330> you'll<00:05:47.629> have<00:05:47.839> time<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.469> in<00:05:48.709> cargo

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:49.489 
that then you'll have time to in cargo

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:53.679 
that then you'll have time to in cargo
space<00:05:49.879> to<00:05:50.179> do<00:05:51.489> better<00:05:52.489> resource<00:05:52.939> runs<00:05:53.179> illicit

cargo things like that and of course
you'll<00:05:56.389> be<00:05:56.449> in<00:05:56.509> a<00:05:56.569> better<00:05:56.749> ship<00:05:56.869> if<00:05:57.139> you<00:05:57.199> want
