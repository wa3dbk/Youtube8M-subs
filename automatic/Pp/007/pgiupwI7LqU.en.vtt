if the fashion show needs to improve
upon<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.660> I<00:01:16.840> think<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.140> runway<00:01:17.470> was<00:01:17.619> a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
upon and I think the runway was a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.190 
upon and I think the runway was a
disaster<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:19.450> run<00:01:19.600> room<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:19.840> very<00:01:20.020> true

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
disaster the run room is very true

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.240 
disaster the run room is very true
because<00:01:20.350> i<00:01:20.440> was<00:01:20.560> sitting<00:01:20.740> actually<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
because i was sitting actually in the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.890 
because i was sitting actually in the
front<00:01:21.490> line<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.940> carpet<00:01:22.270> actually<00:01:22.600> teared

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
front line the carpet actually teared

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.890 
front line the carpet actually teared
and<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.229> was<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.440> bit<00:01:23.680> shaky<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.360> i<00:01:25.390> think<00:01:25.630> we

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
and it was a bit shaky so i think we

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.150 
and it was a bit shaky so i think we
need<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.110> ensure<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.410> we<00:01:26.560> have<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.680> proper<00:01:27.009> one
