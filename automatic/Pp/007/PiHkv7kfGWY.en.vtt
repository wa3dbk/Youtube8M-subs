00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.150
 Congratulations on your new Ventura Freestander. 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.210
 Now we want to show you how to build it up quickly and easily. 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.720
 The easiest way to build it up with 2 people. 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.660
 Next, spread out a Bolon camping rug in front of the vehicle. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.500
 At the corners this should be fastened. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.180
 To set up the tent, the poles on the carpet are laid out first. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.280
 This is put down sorted, 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.320
 all parts are approximately where they will be used later. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.080
 Pay attention to the assembly instructions! 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.460
 First, assemble the linkage parts that form the roof. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.900
 Then mount the 4 footrests without assembling the complete height. 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.891
 Now place the tent skin over the poles and align. 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.100
 Then insert the 2 canopy poles into the 2 front corners. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 The roof is ready now. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.080
 Lift the two feet on one side 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.200
 and then put it together on the other side. 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 Insert the footrests into the control cords and stretch out. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.979
 Close the tent and about in 30 cm. Position the distance from the vehicle. 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.679
 Please make sure that the rear door is opposite the door of the vehicle. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.900
 Now connect the tent to your vehicle. 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.440
 Your Freestander offers several connection options. 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.660
 Tie the packsack or other soft object to the tent lines 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.180
 and throw the whole thing over the vehicle. 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.780
 Secure with pegs on the other side to tighten the connection lock. 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.220
 Depending on the vehicle, the tent may need to be positioned slightly differently. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.400
 Now the tent is attached with herring. 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.460
 Start at the 2 rear corners of the vehicle 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.220
 Then remove the two front corners and fasten. 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.000
 Then remove the entire front wall and the 2 side walls with the pegs. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.360
 Now you can fix the inside pinch strip. 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.820
 Please fasten both straps next to the doors to get optimal tension in the tent. 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.450
 The rear wall door is rolled upwards. 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.320
 The side lock elements are braced as close as possible to the vehicle. 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.020
 This is done on both sides. 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.980
 Draw curtains over the curtain rods 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.540
 before the curtain rods are placed in the retaining loop over the windows. 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.400
 To gather the curtain, this can be attached laterally with the ties. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.140
 You decide for yourself which side of the curtain should show inside and outside. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.280
 An entrance door is located in both sides of the tent 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.590
 A veranda pole can be mounted in the front between the legs 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.390
 Please pull the curtains, so that the window is not directly on the pole. 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.860
 Your freestander is ready now. 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.470
