cute drawings that you can draw
step-by-step<00:00:15.190> in<00:00:15.460> a<00:00:15.670> few<00:00:15.910> minutes<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.660> link

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
step-by-step in a few minutes the link

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.859 
step-by-step in a few minutes the link
is<00:00:16.960> at<00:00:17.109> the<00:00:17.260> end<00:00:17.579> ok<00:00:18.579> first<00:00:18.880> let's<00:00:19.119> start<00:00:19.419> with

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
is at the end ok first let's start with

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:29.669 
is at the end ok first let's start with
a<00:00:21.869> curve<00:00:22.869> like<00:00:23.169> that<00:00:27.989> so<00:00:28.989> this<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.199> going<00:00:29.499> to<00:00:29.560> be

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
a curve like that so this is going to be

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.400 
a curve like that so this is going to be
part<00:00:30.009> of<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.519> wrist<00:00:33.570> from<00:00:34.570> this<00:00:34.810> top<00:00:35.080> part

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
part of the wrist from this top part

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.680 
part of the wrist from this top part
here<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.940> going<00:00:37.270> to<00:00:37.330> go<00:00:37.480> up<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:40.270> up<00:00:40.480> like

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
here I'm going to go up right up like

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.840 
here I'm going to go up right up like
that<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:44.140> draw<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.680> short<00:00:45.070> little

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.340 

now<00:00:49.270> I'm<00:00:49.329> drawing<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.840> curve<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:53.079> curve

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
now I'm drawing a curve so this curve

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.810 
now I'm drawing a curve so this curve
will<00:00:53.530> represent<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.570> fold<00:00:55.570> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.340> fingers

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
will represent the fold in the fingers

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.869 
will represent the fold in the fingers
where<00:00:58.690> they're<00:00:58.870> where<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.680> curl<00:00:59.980> in<00:01:00.250> towards

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
where they're where the curl in towards

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.369 
where they're where the curl in towards
the<00:01:01.030> palm<00:01:01.329> which<00:01:01.840> is<00:01:02.020> on<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.230> other<00:01:02.350> side<00:01:04.379> now

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
the palm which is on the other side now

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.060 
the palm which is on the other side now
I'm<00:01:05.470> going<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.680> draw<00:01:05.830> one<00:01:06.220> big<00:01:06.760> curve<00:01:08.070> coming

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
I'm going to draw one big curve coming

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.380 
I'm going to draw one big curve coming
from<00:01:09.340> around<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.560> front<00:01:11.740> here<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:13.210> can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
from around to the front here you can

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.370 
from around to the front here you can
see<00:01:13.509> this<00:01:13.690> curve<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.110> quite<00:01:14.440> big<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.350> I

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
see this curve is quite big and so I

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.440 
see this curve is quite big and so I
think<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.860> good<00:01:21.100> way<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.280> draw<00:01:21.610> simple

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
think this is a good way to draw simple

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.859 
think this is a good way to draw simple
knuckles<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.940> basically<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.570> just

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
knuckles in and basically I just

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:49.310 
knuckles in and basically I just
repeated<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.530> curve<00:01:30.100> two<00:01:30.940> more<00:01:31.090> times

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.450 

for<00:01:50.320> another<00:01:50.680> curve<00:01:54.510> this<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:57.040> that's<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.340> good

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
for another curve this so that's a good

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.580 
for another curve this so that's a good
way<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.640> make<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.150> look<00:01:58.180> for<00:01:58.690> like<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.170> glove

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
way to make it look for like a glove

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.219 
way to make it look for like a glove
hand

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.279 

now<00:02:04.799> let's<00:02:05.250> draw<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> cute<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.759> face<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
now let's draw a cute little face so

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.369
