you<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> bolt<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.059> bracket<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.629> here

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
you this is a bolt on bracket right here

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.400 
you this is a bolt on bracket right here
it<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.190> works<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> same<00:00:57.410> different

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it also works with the same different
