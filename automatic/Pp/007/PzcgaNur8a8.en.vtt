00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you can see I'm 1008 in my last video I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589 
you can see I'm 1008 in my last video I
showed<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.369> honestly<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> lutes

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
showed you that and honestly the lutes

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
showed you that and honestly the lutes
are<00:00:30.929> malicious<00:00:31.320> today<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:32.009> something<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
are malicious today or something but the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.330 
are malicious today or something but the
lutes<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.910> been<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> lot<00:00:33.329> worse<00:00:33.570> than<00:00:33.750> usual

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
lutes have been a lot worse than usual

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
lutes have been a lot worse than usual
so<00:00:35.600> hopefully<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.719> find<00:00:36.989> something<00:00:37.440> I'm

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so hopefully we can find something I'm

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.280 
so hopefully we can find something I'm
aiming<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.719> 120,000<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.809> before<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
aiming for like 120,000 like before I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.350 
aiming for like 120,000 like before I
could<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.620> 200,000<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.059> right<00:00:42.210> now

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
could get like 200,000 but right now

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
could get like 200,000 but right now
it's<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.600> looking<00:00:42.930> too<00:00:43.320> good<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.610> is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.039 
a time the link in the description if
this<00:01:01.020> does<00:01:01.230> take<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.670> three<00:01:02.850> minutes

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
this does take like two or three minutes

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.850 
this does take like two or three minutes
or<00:01:04.049> am<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.500> cut<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> general<00:01:05.540> huh

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
or am I just cut it out in general huh

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.940 
or am I just cut it out in general huh
105<00:01:07.860> thousand<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.549> kind<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.610> hard

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
105 thousand it's actually kind of hard

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.600 
105 thousand it's actually kind of hard
to<00:01:16.950> decide<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.030> not

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
to decide if I want to do this or not

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
to decide if I want to do this or not
one<00:01:20.610> hundred<00:01:20.880> five<00:01:21.150> thousand<00:01:21.750> ah<00:01:26.900> I<00:01:27.900> really

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
one hundred five thousand ah I really

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
one hundred five thousand ah I really
don't<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.820> feel<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.390> find

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
don't know I feel like it can find

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.039 
don't know I feel like it can find
something<00:01:30.750> better

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
something better

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
something better
we'll<00:01:31.890> find<00:01:32.100> something<00:01:32.250> better<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.700> feel<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we'll find something better I feel it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.219 
we'll find something better I feel it
105<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.229> barely<00:01:34.500> any<00:01:34.590> elixir<00:01:35.159> either

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
105 is it was barely any elixir either

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.330 
105 is it was barely any elixir either
so<00:01:37.229> hopefully<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.920> find<00:01:38.070> something

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so hopefully we can find something

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
so hopefully we can find something
better<00:01:38.430> hopefully<00:01:42.409> maybe<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.530> should<00:01:43.710> have

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
better hopefully maybe I should have

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.609 
better hopefully maybe I should have
took<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.409> find

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
took it but you know what if we find

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
took it but you know what if we find
another<00:01:46.860> 120<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.790> maybe<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.210> eighty

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
another 120 with maybe like eighty

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.260 
another 120 with maybe like eighty
thousand<00:01:48.990> will<00:01:49.079> take<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.470> instead<00:01:50.270> because

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
thousand will take that instead because

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.130 
thousand will take that instead because
there's<00:01:51.420> obviously<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:51.930> bases<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.439> there

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
there's obviously better bases out there

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
there's obviously better bases out there
but<00:01:55.140> yeah<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.619> rush<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.040> townhall<00:01:56.340> 8<00:01:56.520> like

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
but yeah don't rush to townhall 8 like

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
but yeah don't rush to townhall 8 like
honestly<00:01:57.060> max<00:01:57.990> out<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.469> uh

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
honestly max out here uh

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.999 
honestly max out here uh
base<00:01:59.549> before<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> basically<00:02:00.659> did<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.350> max

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
base before I basically did that but max

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889 
base before I basically did that but max
it<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.430> stay<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.000> you'll<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> ton<00:02:03.869> more

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it out stay there you'll get a ton more

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
it out stay there you'll get a ton more
gold<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.619> higher<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> lower<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
gold the higher you are up the lower the
