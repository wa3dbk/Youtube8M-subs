00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.899
 welcome everyone again monday and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 3dnews daily with you again with fresh 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:15.330
 news about the future of high technology 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.699
 distant and not so remember the names 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.010
 martin kaltenbrunner it to a yourself 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 you can then boast that they knew them 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 even before they got the nobel 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.539
 two university researchers 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.490
 tokyo 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 invented the material of the future durable 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.929
 flexible and very very light it is something 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.920
 resembles human skin for example it 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.870
 able to feel 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.250
 pressure put on him only 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.710
 imagine the possibilities of its use 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.059
 due to one nanometer thickness 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.219
 material can be used in 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 as a second layer of skin capable 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.700
 track the signal and your body or 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.710
 let's say to create medical 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.570
 implants that can literally 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.399
 feel also in the material is possible 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.260
 embed temperature sensor and then 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 a strip of plastic can really 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.370
 become a substitute for real skin for people with 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.050
 prosthetic or even for robots however 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.239
 the researchers will have another good 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 work hard before we see the finished 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.879
 super skin usable in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.400
 medicine 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.400
 or robotics science is not fast 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 as microsoft promised internet browser 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.180
 explorer 11 slowly but surely got 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 up to the seventh version of windows 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.430
 leisurely and most important 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.650
 the change was the acceleration of his work and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.540
 microsoft boot times especially 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.700
 proud of java execution speed 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 script in your browser tests show 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.290
 that in this regard, internet explorer 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.060
 11 faster than chrome firefox or opera 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.189
 so far a new internet explorer for 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.170
 windows 7 only available

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.869
 microsoft 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.299
 most modern robots 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.560
 show their abilities 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.990
 exclusively within the walls of the lab with their 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.820
 ideal conditions exclusion such 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.409
 like alpha dog production boston 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.570
 dinamix can be counted on fingers 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.880
 Recently one more was added to their list. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.259
 meet this is the effect he comes from

 others are able 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.470
 collect and robot researchers hope 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 that one day the artex talents will find 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.220

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.090
