00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
used them before so we're gonna see just

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.279 
used them before so we're gonna see just
how<00:00:26.880> quick<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.240> easy<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> figure

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
how quick and easy they are to figure

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.880 
how quick and easy they are to figure
out<00:00:28.849> to<00:00:29.849> do<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:30.960> my<00:00:31.590> quail

like 53 of them so let me get them

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.680 
like 53 of them so let me get them
washed<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.030> we'll<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> few<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.660> here

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
washed and then we'll do a few in here

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.680 
washed and then we'll do a few in here
and<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:44.100> easy<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:45.030> right<00:00:45.539> off
