00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.359
 hello together in 2014 and I'll get in touch 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.759
 back with my first book recommendation 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.679
 For this year the book I am today 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.810
 you can also win this 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.060
 but get more at the end of the video 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.640
 now first to the content and that goes 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.680
 The plans are fully gifted 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.120
 Sophie seeberg and I have that now 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 not written to it but it stands 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.510
 actually on the title and it carries 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.480
 the subtitle from the life of one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.130
 family psychologist and this one sentence 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.860
 actually puts quite well on the point 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.960
 what the author is about in this book 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 is just a family psychologist and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.790
 prepared for the court reports 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 So she is assigned to families 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.940
 to look at and who is now 1 and 1 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.180
 can probably add up 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.710
 already think that your rule around 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.939
 Families do not go that way 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.680
 runs rosily and accordingly whimsical and 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.670
 some are also startling 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 stories in this book 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.870
 compiled are both titles as 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.159
 also covers of the book convey so only 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.800
 once the impression we would have it here 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.480
 to do with claptrap in the broadest sense 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.409
 but I would go there soon 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.750
 contradict 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.460
 because although the book is very humorous 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.430
 and also entertaining is written 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.229
 the author is by no means disrespectful 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 with the really serious topic around 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.830
 and so on me one way or another 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.690
 Actually make the laugh sometimes 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.880
 he got stuck in the middle 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.380
 if, for example, a young mother 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 with her just one and a half years 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.920
 old or young child discusses why it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 your right to care not aware 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.159
 but at the same time is very pregnant with 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.190
 the second child and the flat just 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.990
 on um umräumen is then then then 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.330
 you enjoy yourself over the way 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 as it is written thinks 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.390
 but also in what kind of world 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.159
 we live and that is now 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.229
 rather a harmless example indeed 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.020
 are then a few stories in it 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.450
 the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.060
 he make sure that I am with the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.009
 shook his head that was a 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.119
 example, it is just an episode book 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.190
 has no continuous history 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.730
 but consists of many episodes 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.970
 which describe exactly such cases and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.010
 the author has just managed that 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.489
 quite entertaining but not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.349
 to disrespectfully describe that 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.019
 I succeeded because it is there 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.230
 many situations would have offered 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.420
 to grab it and my respect 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.590
 for that worked as well as 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.269
 We promise to come now 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.709
 Raffle of the book next to mine 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.349
 own copy I have here 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.400
 Another unread it new and accurate 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.510
 you can win that 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.860
 what you have to do for it is very simple 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.239
 leave a comment that 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.700
 should you subordinate my anyway 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.560
 do videos then automatically end part 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.269
 you should not be interested in it 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.340
 to win this book then please in 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.870
 I will briefly write a subordinate sentence 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.440
 I do not want to participate and you are flying 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.030
 automatically from the lostopf 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.709
 otherwise, every comment will take part 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.329
 So no specific task 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.600
 I will be the winner 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.680
 post on facebook and twitter 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.269
 and personally I will write the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.069
 but you should also win 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.019
 want who won in the end 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.209
 then follow more on twitter or 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.709
 facebook or both the left finds 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.680
 her in the infobox they stand there 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.700
 anyway everytime 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.950
 the winner should be interested in it 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.480
 have a signed copy too 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.489
 get with a personal dedication 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.139
 or so then that is possible then 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.720
 but you have to win on yours 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.910
 Wait a little longer because I like the whole thing 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.280
 rather with the author must deny 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.730
 and then it has to be shared 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.220
 possible so a signed copy that 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.840
 we can then discuss in person like that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.549
 I hope I was curious 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.560
 because this book deserves it 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.870
 he's running pretty well I have 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.669
 seen that is in the sales charts 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.500
 pretty high up and that's it 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.720
 In fact, the academy also deserves it 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.790
 is of highly gifted sophie seeberg 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.680
 look at it all the time if you 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.389
 you are interested in the topic of the book 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.680
 deserved it 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.569
 I think that should have been it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.730
