 let's start with a pompadour 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.840
 push 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.030
 you just have to separate the part of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.730
 in front of your hair take a 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.820
 brush 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.000
 and close up from the tips 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.920
 towards the head repeatedly until 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.680
 you make a pancake ok later you're going to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.210
 polish and will hold it like this with a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.820
 Barrette 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.360
 after making a French braid 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.200
 has reversed events and takes a lock or 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.140
 you divide by three million and you leave your 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.720
 left in the middle right to the middle and 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.150
 then you re-braid in a normal way 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.300
 and in the second round you add a lock 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.310
 more hair on both sides you can 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.360
 do so first by passing the lock or 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 you can also get the millionth 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
 loose and then add another one and pass them 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.800
 together in the middle but it will always be 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.820
 inverted way or below until 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.780
 you finish everything to your trencita ok 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.670
