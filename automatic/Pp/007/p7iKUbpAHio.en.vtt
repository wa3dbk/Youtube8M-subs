now sometimes they have a washer inside

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.170 
now sometimes they have a washer inside
of<00:01:36.540> these<00:01:37.070> first<00:01:38.070> thing<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.850> sure<00:01:38.880> it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
of these first thing do make sure it's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.499 
of these first thing do make sure it's
tight<00:01:39.439> if<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> loose<00:01:41.520> tighten<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.210> see

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
tight if it is loose tighten it up see

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
tight if it is loose tighten it up see
if<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.780> seals<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.729> need<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
if it seals if not you will need to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.910 
if it seals if not you will need to
replace<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.869> supply<00:01:46.290> lines<00:01:46.590> because

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
replace the supply lines because

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.520 
replace the supply lines because
unfortunately<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.820> seals<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.530> usually

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
unfortunately these seals are usually

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.760 
unfortunately these seals are usually
not<00:01:49.860> available<00:01:50.210> separate<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.500> point

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
not available separate so at that point

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.080 
not available separate so at that point
you'll<00:01:53.040> need<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.600> match<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> length<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
you'll need to match up the length and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.420 
you'll need to match up the length and
replace<00:01:57.090> them<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.590> again<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:58.799> Terry<00:01:59.130> with
