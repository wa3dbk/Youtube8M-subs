00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.599
 The urgent often makes us forget the important one. 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.379
 Many times the urgent thing makes us forget 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.769
 the important thing 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.730
 Why do I say this? Especially for us men. 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.970
 Men, in general, we look closely 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.169
 how are we going to finance the whole house? Where are we going to get the resources? 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.599
 If there is going to be a credit, if I have money saved, if I have to sell a car. In 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.070
 Finally, there are many ways to obtain the resources to build the house. 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.970
 Men, we look at this a lot, 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.750
 women look much more at 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 how the kitchen is going to be, how is it going to be 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.510
 the bathroom, the plants, as are the curtains, the colors. 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.130
 More scones to the dream of the house 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.590
 than the whole process of realization and construction. 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.930
 We are more technical, we look in short, how are we going to 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.370
 do to be able to finance all that. 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.770
 I do not say that we are all, but of all the clients that we have seen in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.410
 general 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.740
 we can typify it in this way. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 Men, they worry about financing. Women, 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.050
 more on the part how the house will be. 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.230
 Therefore, never leave 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.520
 that the urgent 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 overcome what is important. 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.250
 The important thing is how the house will be, 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 If your dream is to make a house of 200 square meters, 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.180
 do not let the urgent 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.460
 I clouded my eyesight 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.650
 and you have to make a house of 70 meters. 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.510
 Because you're going to lose the best. 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.730
 In the future, 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.630
 a business is coming, 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810
 the wind is going to put in the stern ... 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 In short, there may be changes, new businesses, 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.620
 promotion, 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 until an inheritance ... In short, it can change the future. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.300
 Time, 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.180
 things can be happening in time 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.700
 that they will give you the resources to continue with the house. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 Poses a house 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.480
 in stages. 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.819
 Think 200 meters, 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.659
 but seventy now that are the resources you have. 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.669
 It's very easy for us to do it, it's more, 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.149
 most of the projects we do 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.109
 we put them in stages precisely 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.389
 because money in general, not enough. 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.229
 Because even if your money was, 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.389
 and if your budget was over 200 square meters, 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.079
 you're going to want a 240. We always see it 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.469
 We always go 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:36.729
 a little more 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.919
 what we really can. 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.149
 So, 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.869
 my final advice, 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.819
 do not stop dreaming 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.199
 Even if you do not have the money today. 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.499
 Prepare the whole house 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.029
 and make a little part. 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.909
 70 meters, 80 meters, 60, those that are 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.519
 you get in now and then 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.620
 As circumstances change, you will be able to move forward with the project.
