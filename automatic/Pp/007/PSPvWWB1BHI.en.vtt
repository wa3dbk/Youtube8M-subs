yourselves into the 21st century this is

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.710 
yourselves into the 21st century this is
what<00:01:33.400> people<00:01:33.759> were<00:01:33.970> thinking<00:01:34.030> about<00:01:34.479> years

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
what people were thinking about years

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.200 
what people were thinking about years
ago<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:36.100> now<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.550> partnership<00:01:36.970> was

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
ago right now the partnership was

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.690 
ago right now the partnership was
basically<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.960> form<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:39.160> most<00:01:39.340> technically

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
basically to form the most technically

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.850 
basically to form the most technically
advanced<00:01:40.030> building<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.630> NBA<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.619> we

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
advanced building in the NBA so we

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.660 
advanced building in the NBA so we
partnered<00:01:42.280> with<00:01:42.310> Harris<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:44.410> think<00:01:45.009> their

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
partnered with Harris and I think their

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.889 
partnered with Harris and I think their
technology<00:01:46.180> with<00:01:46.360> our<00:01:46.869> vision<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.100> created

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
technology with our vision and created

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.930 
technology with our vision and created
the<00:01:49.899> most<00:01:50.170> technically<00:01:50.619> sound<00:01:50.950> building<00:01:51.790> in
