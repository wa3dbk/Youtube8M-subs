studies students really I feel have to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.290 
studies students really I feel have to
understand<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.609> research<00:00:26.910> culture

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
understand what research culture

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.220 
understand what research culture
actually<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.349> working<00:00:29.160> independently

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
actually is and working independently

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.840 
actually is and working independently
and<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.619> go<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.340> nine

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and then here we go into the nine

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.639 
and then here we go into the nine
designs<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.570> chose<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.380> part<00:00:34.410> of

it is you already know obviously on a BA
program<00:01:45.509> there's<00:01:45.689> lots<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> research<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
program there's lots of research and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
program there's lots of research and
evaluation<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:48.000> an<00:01:48.090> MA<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:49.049> probably

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
evaluation but an MA you're probably

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.420 
evaluation but an MA you're probably
going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.560> looking<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> specific

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
research question it's very important as

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.190 
research question it's very important as
well<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> context

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
well the that they have a context

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.709 
well the that they have a context
that<00:02:00.409> they've<00:02:00.590> researched<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.719> understand

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
that they've researched and understand

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.870 
that they've researched and understand
maybe<00:02:03.130> designers<00:02:04.130> are<00:02:04.280> artists<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.759> are

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880

this<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.319> light<00:03:03.470> came<00:03:03.739> vertically

this and the light came vertically

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.850 
this and the light came vertically
almost<00:03:05.390> showering<00:03:05.629> down<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.049> wall<00:03:06.230> things

tend<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.400> be<00:03:07.489> very<00:03:07.700> big<00:03:07.970> portfolios<00:03:08.810> on

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959

tend to be very big portfolios on
foundation<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:09.830> gradually<00:03:10.310> they<00:03:10.970> get

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
foundation and then gradually they get

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.150 
foundation and then gradually they get

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
smaller and smaller and I think for MA

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.119 
smaller and smaller and I think for MA
you<00:03:14.000> know<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.660> have<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> body<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.590> work<00:03:15.769> and
