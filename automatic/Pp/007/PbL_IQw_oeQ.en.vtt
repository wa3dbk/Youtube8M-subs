00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.610
 Well, let's start with a 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.510
 color that is very clear is a color like 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.039
 sand not the white that which yes 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:25.689
 let's make a smoky green eye 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.730
 are not the effects of red 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 If I told you, you are an artist 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.809
 if you know what is looking for me 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.239
 I think that they like me I like more 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.670
 better the green eye and the red lips and 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.420
 then already put to the end do not sell excites 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.070
 the car because good with a brush 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.070
 if we are going to apply on the whole eye 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.680
 I explain this that arribita 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.470
 the arch below the eyebrow as a troy 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.060
 Little bit of brilliance remember that it helps us 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.880
 to blur if we do not explain the 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.390
 Cock of uncomfortable means I already made my 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:09.670
 base and now I like a color that is a 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.670
 very very bright green is this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.430
 this is the color 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.120
 of salt 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.100
 Y 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.490
 These two guys are very good because 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 Bring both the brush to apply and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 smoking like the one that's like the little apartment for 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 now yes yes yes richer arias 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.710
 era and the little figure ok 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 well, in that all those who have the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.420
 logo jump itself as all this 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 overcast we always have to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.230
 look for the deepest arch up for 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.880
 create that we have depth to in the 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.000
 eye that because we have it silicone that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.460
 they sell orbited ok ok since I put it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.460
 I'm going to apply on my mobile eyelid 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.310
 this is the color like that very green 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.520
 electric 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.520
 I will give it light or that only 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.060
 the play 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.330
 this can be a green seeing that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.330
 as 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.610
 his music did not fall on me 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.610
 so I do not know what brand it is because I bought it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.940
 in the center Julia Sanchez says but 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.410
 has a lot of pigment ok now if that and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.030
 we have to have place that kind of 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.910
 colors that paint a lot this is it 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.460
 like that mate and with this one that is like 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.490
 This little one of the face secret brand is 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.330
 a god knows that he is also the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.770
 completely salt and the truth that yes 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.150
 it 's worth it, I say yes, many 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.770
 profit if you want to invest understand 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.080
 nothing else that this is what this 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.780
 you can do everything ok and that the corner 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.560
 look, let's push 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.030
 like a drink 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.030
 you are watching here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:02.110
 a triangle I only have one very 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.150
 bright and one not so bright but 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.940
 moderate and a little corner that obviously 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.620
 it's not going to stay that way true today 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.620
 I never like anything for down sorry 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.800
 now 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.570
 let's go back to our fluffy 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.460
 and I'll take the check and do not work 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.100
 you are better to have another brand is a 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.410
 green that brings as pigments negritos 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.600
 I have seen them also of nothing is of 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.760
 mch 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.130
 Well, they're the only ones that touch me 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.750
 see has only applied a little bit if you do not 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.850
 you have this nothing happens you can even 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.530
 put a black one and mix it 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.380
 personal 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.970
 and that is very little agreement we remove the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.050
 excess because what we're going to do is 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.050
 blur this here 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.830
 to give depth you remember what 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.830
 I told 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 at this depth 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.269
 and now if we already create our base of 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.310
 logo in green that follows that is very 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.129
 important we are going to apply if you have 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.829
 a very creamy black pencil site 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.859
 what for better but mine is 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.950
 better than mine that is the brand 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.659
 mascara is black and three much dots 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.680
 glossy greens and you get up 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.139
 I was on rhode and nothing happens if you 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.560
 I say and counted on your hand to make them 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.419
 your skin is a ray remember that this 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.300
 is the one to be blurred to make 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.729
 the famous smoky eye a girl 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.150
 we apologize it is very difficult the recorded 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.990
 I'm going to apply tantito down here just a 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 little bit more 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:50.479
 what if now good with what I thought that 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:53.849
 do is more to blur so that 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:56.159
 give him with everything I will go back to grab the 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.610
 neighborhood green very well that no 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.610
 I want problems 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.300
 as my brush I remove and remember that 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.040
 On top of what I put black I'm going to 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.980
 put this color ok and now if I start to 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.710
 blur 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.650
 being the human appears that the effect 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.680
 smoked means that it goes from more to 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.680
 less 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.050
 okay 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.110
 I take some more immob on the part of 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.110
 down 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.540
 check if you already liked it as well as two 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.510
 parents 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.790
 I always finish makeup I come back 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.400
 lets start 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.160
 and he gives it back a little bit here I do not know 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.730
 where does it start not determined for 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.770
 I tell them always to blur what good 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.920
 next, let's make an eyeliner 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.920
 nothing more to frame the eye 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.440
 and always with this anti I want you up 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.440
 and down 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:13.410
 and this we already have eyes of the 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:17.640
 called red and his blush cited and already 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.240
 they saw that it brings some braids there 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.240
 tickets'
