the pros and cons to these two different

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.300 
the pros and cons to these two different

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
designs well in a twin tube design it's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
designs well in a twin tube design it's
a<00:01:11.460> low<00:01:11.700> pressure<00:01:11.940> dampening<00:01:12.479> system<00:01:12.900> which

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
a low pressure dampening system which

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
a low pressure dampening system which
tends<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> lead<00:01:13.740> towards<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> softer<00:01:14.580> ride<00:01:14.760> now

tends to lead towards a softer ride now

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
tends to lead towards a softer ride now

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because it's low pressure under heavy

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.000 
because it's low pressure under heavy
cornering<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.900> may<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.260> some<00:01:19.409> unwanted<00:01:19.680> body

to be a little more consistent so I'd

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.820
