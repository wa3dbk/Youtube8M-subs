not upgraded but just modified with
Seiko<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:16.670> think<00:01:16.850> samurai<00:01:17.270> hands<00:01:17.510> these<00:01:17.720> are<00:01:18.160> by

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
Seiko I think samurai hands these are by

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.540 
Seiko I think samurai hands these are by
the<00:01:19.220> previous<00:01:19.730> owner<00:01:20.260> before<00:01:21.260> was<00:01:21.650> treated<00:01:22.430> to

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
the previous owner before was treated to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.900 
the previous owner before was treated to
me

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
me

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.420 
me
so<00:01:23.480> this<00:01:24.080> they<00:01:24.470> come<00:01:24.620> in<00:01:24.740> various<00:01:25.070> colors<00:01:25.130> and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
so this they come in various colors and

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.950 
so this they come in various colors and
combinations<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.600> things<00:01:26.750> like<00:01:26.900> that

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
combinations and things like that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.280 
combinations and things like that
visibly<00:01:27.590> all<00:01:27.830> steel<00:01:28.160> version<00:01:28.870> with<00:01:29.870> with<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
visibly all steel version with with the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.990 
visibly all steel version with with the
black<00:01:30.530> bezel<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.340> think<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.580> comes<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.910> a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
black bezel and I think it comes in a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.380 
black bezel and I think it comes in a
two-tone<00:01:32.570> like<00:01:32.930> rose<00:01:33.440> gold<00:01:33.860> as<00:01:34.159> well<00:01:34.400> as<00:01:34.550> all

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
two-tone like rose gold as well as all

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.260 
two-tone like rose gold as well as all
black<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.890> other<00:01:37.100> types<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.640> highlighting

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
black and other types of highlighting

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.970 
black and other types of highlighting
with<00:01:38.450> like<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.960> one<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.170> was<00:01:39.320> red<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.860> think

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
with like this one I was red I think

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.890 
with like this one I was red I think
they<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.370> different<00:01:40.730> colors<00:01:41.030> on<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.659> dial

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
they have different colors on the dial

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.399 
they have different colors on the dial
there's<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.440> few<00:01:42.740> different<00:01:43.040> models<00:01:43.220> available

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
there's a few different models available

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.880 
there's a few different models available
these<00:01:45.409> guys<00:01:45.620> they're<00:01:46.490> pretty<00:01:46.670> big<00:01:46.970> yet<00:01:47.210> I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
these guys they're pretty big yet I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.969 
these guys they're pretty big yet I
believe<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.659> do<00:01:50.659> they<00:01:50.810> call<00:01:50.990> 48<00:01:51.590> millimeters

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
believe what do they call 48 millimeters

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.420 
believe what do they call 48 millimeters
or<00:01:52.430> something<00:01:52.729> like<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:53.360> um<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:55.130> doesn't

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
or something like that but um it doesn't

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.760 
or something like that but um it doesn't
it<00:01:56.150> doesn't<00:01:56.360> really<00:01:56.659> wear<00:01:56.990> like<00:01:57.290> 48

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
it doesn't really wear like 48

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.219 
it doesn't really wear like 48
millimeters<00:01:58.040> probably<00:01:58.909> because<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.390> angles

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
millimeters probably because it angles

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.460 
millimeters probably because it angles
in<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:02.479> was<00:02:02.659> probably<00:02:03.080> more<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.640> 45<00:02:05.470> 46

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
in it was probably more like a 45 46

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.149 
in it was probably more like a 45 46
maybe<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.760> with<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> short<00:02:08.299> lug<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.810> and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159 
maybe but with the short lug with and

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.309 
maybe but with the short lug with and
and<00:02:10.159> stuff<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.909> doesn't<00:02:11.120> really

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
and stuff like that it doesn't really

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.110 
and stuff like that it doesn't really
feel<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.620> big<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.950> crystal<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:16.940> this

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
feel that big the the crystal on this

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.960
