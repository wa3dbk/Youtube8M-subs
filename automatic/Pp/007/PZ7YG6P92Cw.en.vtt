00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and well it's already Wednesday of science and 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.009
 technology and let's see this story 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 of Bolivia where a short while to the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.150
 launch of its first tupac satellite 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 katari and before this a group of scholars 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
 Bolivians have been trained in 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 spatial matter so that they assume the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.529
 control and administration of this 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 device that will be placed in orbit 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.000
 this December 20th we know the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 details of this story with our 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.460
 correspondent 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.230
 freddy morals 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.970
 with the opening of the main 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.919
 earth station near the city of 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 peace and the first Bolivian satellite 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.260
 that will enter orbit on December 20 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.110
 is already perceived as a reality we are 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.910
 well excited are we want 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 be up to the challenge we are 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.940
 preparing and we're still going to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.190
 continue preparing until the arrival 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.260
 launch day and be able to control it 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.059
 from here I see more than everything 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.309
 correctly established and how I had 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.030
 that be so I'm pretty confident 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.340
 that everything will turn out well 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.890
 There are 72 Bolivian professionals 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.809
 chosen from among 1,000 applicants who 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 will be trained in china to administer 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.909
 all phases of satellite control 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.040
 and of the two earth stations the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.869
 first six months we have received the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 training what is the design of 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.970
 our satellite and we have learned 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.909
 what are its parts that is composed 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.770
 what are your great challenge and functions 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.229
 also a great responsibility that 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.140
 we are assuming the people we have 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.539
 I was lucky to be able to do this 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.700
 course and be part of this fact 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.759
 historical in our country 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.740
 the tupac katari satellite will start 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.600
 provide services in the first trimester 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.520
 Of 2014 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.320
 the team of pioneering professionals in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.679
 the beginning of the space age in bolivia 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.140
 included four military personnel is 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.600
 a feeling of pride this is could 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.479
 have been done a lot before but they 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.060
 you have to now happens it has been given these 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.399
 leaps and bounds accelerated this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.100
 position to bolivia then in one in a 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.770
 great big situation not only to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.209
 national level but at a strategic level 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.970
 the fellows were divided into two 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.619
 groups half in charge of the control of 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.310
 satellite and maintenance of 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.299
 earth stations and the other half 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.010
 will constitute the first campus of 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.620
 experts from the Bolivian agency 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.379
 space 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.379
 freddy morals has south bolivia
