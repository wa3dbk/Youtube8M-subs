thing you're gonna want to do is get

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.150 
thing you're gonna want to do is get
your<00:00:44.820> 1-inch<00:00:45.510> bulkhead<00:00:45.989> I'll<00:00:46.559> link<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.860> into

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
your 1-inch bulkhead I'll link that into

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.479 
your 1-inch bulkhead I'll link that into
the<00:00:47.280> description<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> basically<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.460> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the description and basically you just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.630 
the description and basically you just
drill<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> hole<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.980> it's<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
drill a hole and it's a one and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920 
drill a hole and it's a one and
three-quarter<00:00:54.000> inch<00:00:54.210> hole<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.780> put

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
three-quarter inch hole and then you put

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
three-quarter inch hole and then you put
the<00:00:55.020> bulkhead<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> tighten<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.329> as

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the bulkhead in and you tighten it up as

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
the bulkhead in and you tighten it up as
tight<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:57.930> ago<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.590> water<00:00:58.829> sealed

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
tight there's ago and it's water sealed

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
tight there's ago and it's water sealed
so<00:00:59.370> when<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> water<00:01:00.390> comes<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.109> water

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
so when the water comes up and water

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
so when the water comes up and water
comes<00:01:02.160> through<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> little

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
comes through up here there's a little

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.490 
comes through up here there's a little
hole<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.860> gonna<00:01:04.979> fall<00:01:06.020> back<00:01:07.020> from<00:01:07.229> over

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
hole and it's gonna fall back from over

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 
hole and it's gonna fall back from over
here<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.479> gonna<00:01:09.689> fall<00:01:09.900> straight

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
here and it's just gonna fall straight

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760 
here and it's just gonna fall straight
to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> tank<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> next<00:01:13.560> thing<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to the tank so then the next thing you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
to the tank so then the next thing you
need<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.760> build<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.509> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
need to do is build this thing like I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
need to do is build this thing like I
said<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.259> cross<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.950> four

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
said it's just a little cross with four

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.210 
said it's just a little cross with four
right<00:01:17.790> angles<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.710> you're<00:01:19.710> gonna<00:01:19.830> put<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
right angles and you're gonna put that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.969 
right angles and you're gonna put that
on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.549> bottom<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.450> your<00:01:21.979> five-gallon

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
on the very bottom of your five-gallon

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
on the very bottom of your five-gallon
bucket<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:27.290> what

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
bucket and what this is gonna do what

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.960 
bucket and what this is gonna do what
this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.040> gonna<00:01:29.549> raise

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
this is gonna do is it's gonna raise

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.929 
this is gonna do is it's gonna raise
it's<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:30.930> raise<00:01:31.400> everything<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's gonna raise everything up so that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.050 
it's gonna raise everything up so that
nothing<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.259> path<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
nothing can get in the path of the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.359 
nothing can get in the path of the
bulkhead<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.270> nothing<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.780> clog<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
bulkhead so nothing can clog it up and

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.130 
bulkhead so nothing can clog it up and
then<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.360> you're<00:01:39.540> gonna<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.869> is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
then the next thing you're gonna do is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.630 
then the next thing you're gonna do is
get<00:01:40.579> one<00:01:41.579> part<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.689> egg<00:01:42.810> crate<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> just

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
get one part of your egg crate I just

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
get one part of your egg crate I just
cut<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> fits<00:01:45.659> straight<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
cut it out so it fits straight in the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.990 
cut it out so it fits straight in the
bucket<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:48.920> then<00:01:49.920> after<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:50.729> going

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
bucket and then after that you're going

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.289 
bucket and then after that you're going
to<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.780> bunch<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.380> scrubby's<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> that's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
to put a bunch of scrubby's and that's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.139 
to put a bunch of scrubby's and that's
gonna<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.720> bio<00:01:54.899> media<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.040> once<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.000> put

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
gonna be your bio media and once I put

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.580 
gonna be your bio media and once I put
all<00:01:57.270> those<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.810> can't<00:01:58.170> won't<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.500> one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
all those in I can't won't do that one

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.810 
all those in I can't won't do that one
hand<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.009> been<00:01:59.100> took<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> long<00:01:59.399> time<00:01:59.549> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
hand and it's been took a long time so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.499 
hand and it's been took a long time so
once<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> you'll<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.009> second

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
once I do that you'll see in a second

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
once I do that you'll see in a second
all<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.659> got<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> scrubbers<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
all right I got the scrubbers in and I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.889 
all right I got the scrubbers in and I
realized<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> most<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.540> into

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
realized that the most you can get into

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.800 
realized that the most you can get into
in<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:07.530> layer<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.009> about<00:02:08.250> nine<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.970> once<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
in one layer is about nine and once you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.119 
in one layer is about nine and once you
get<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.020> goal<00:02:10.140> scrubbers<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.979> you're

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
get your goal scrubbers in then you're

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.059 
get your goal scrubbers in then you're
gonna<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.670> your

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
gonna want to get your

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.220 
gonna want to get your
piece<00:02:12.249> of<00:02:12.280> egg<00:02:12.489> crepe<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.060> pretty<00:02:13.989> much<00:02:14.170> just

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
piece of egg crepe and pretty much just

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.830 
piece of egg crepe and pretty much just
create<00:02:16.829> another<00:02:17.829> layer<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.480> once<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.599> create

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
create another layer and once you create

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.869 
create another layer and once you create
that<00:02:19.989> other<00:02:20.139> layer<00:02:20.349> then<00:02:20.920> I'm<00:02:21.189> gonna<00:02:21.430> put<00:02:21.700> my

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
that other layer then I'm gonna put my

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.390 
that other layer then I'm gonna put my
other<00:02:22.420> filtration<00:02:22.959> media<00:02:23.260> which<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:23.889> carbon

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
other filtration media which is carbon

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.539 
other filtration media which is carbon
and<00:02:24.430> filter<00:02:25.239> floss<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:26.409> I've<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.159> two<00:02:27.340> pounds

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
and filter floss and I've got two pounds

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.309 
and filter floss and I've got two pounds
of<00:02:27.790> carbon<00:02:27.999> just<00:02:28.209> because<00:02:28.510> I'm<00:02:28.689> going<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.109> be

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
of carbon just because I'm going to be

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.750 
of carbon just because I'm going to be
filtering<00:02:29.530> my<00:02:29.889> big<00:02:30.129> pond<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:33.430> gonna<00:02:33.579> take

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
filtering my big pond so it's gonna take

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.399 
filtering my big pond so it's gonna take
a<00:02:33.790> lot<00:02:33.939> of<00:02:33.969> carbon<00:02:34.389> and<00:02:34.540> then<00:02:34.900> I'm<00:02:35.049> gonna<00:02:35.170> have

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
a lot of carbon and then I'm gonna have

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.990 
a lot of carbon and then I'm gonna have
the<00:02:35.709> CFS<00:02:36.700> 500<00:02:37.180> filtering<00:02:37.659> into<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.849> Skippy

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
the CFS 500 filtering into this Skippy

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.780 
the CFS 500 filtering into this Skippy
so<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.629> CFS<00:02:41.079> is<00:02:41.319> actually<00:02:42.069> all<00:02:42.219> mechanical

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so the CFS is actually all mechanical

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.550 
so the CFS is actually all mechanical
filtration<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.659> this<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.959> gonna<00:02:44.079> be<00:02:44.260> packed

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
filtration so this is gonna be packed

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.640 
filtration so this is gonna be packed
with<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.799> bunch<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.189> bio<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.930> biased<00:02:47.260> bio

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
with a bunch of bio like biased bio

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.890 
with a bunch of bio like biased bio
media<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.129> stuff<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.689> hopefully<00:02:49.689> that<00:02:49.840> will

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
media and stuff so hopefully that will

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.599 
media and stuff so hopefully that will
keep<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.169> water<00:02:50.260> clean<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.829> then<00:02:51.430> I've<00:02:51.579> just

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
keep the water clean and then I've just

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.259 
keep the water clean and then I've just
got<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:52.269> filter<00:02:53.049> floss<00:02:53.189> just<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.370> filter

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
got this filter floss just to filter

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.089 
got this filter floss just to filter
everything<00:02:55.480> out<00:02:55.659> a<00:02:55.719> little<00:02:55.989> bit<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:57.069> put

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
everything out a little bit and you put

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.699 
everything out a little bit and you put
the<00:02:57.370> top<00:02:57.549> on<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.969> you're<00:02:58.629> ready<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.930> go

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
the top on and you're ready to go

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.009 
the top on and you're ready to go
I'll<00:03:00.699> try<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.209> some<00:03:01.239> clips<00:03:01.689> of<00:03:01.900> this

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
I'll try to get some clips of this

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.229 
I'll try to get some clips of this
filter<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.379> action<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:03.400> my<00:03:03.519> CFS<00:03:03.939> plugged

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
filter in action with my CFS plugged

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.929 
filter in action with my CFS plugged
into<00:03:04.389> it<00:03:04.659> but<00:03:05.439> I<00:03:05.500> gotta<00:03:05.709> figure<00:03:06.219> out<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.489> CFS

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
into it but I gotta figure out my CFS

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.759 
into it but I gotta figure out my CFS
first<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.480> because<00:03:07.689> there's<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.409> leak<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
first just because there's a leak in it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.050 
first just because there's a leak in it
somewhere<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.189> gotta<00:03:09.340> patch<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.819> but<00:03:10.030> uh

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
somewhere and I gotta patch it but uh

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.229 
somewhere and I gotta patch it but uh
that's<00:03:10.629> how<00:03:10.719> you<00:03:10.870> keep<00:03:11.109> your<00:03:11.230> filter<00:03:12.180> see<00:03:13.180> you

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
that's how you keep your filter see you

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.359 
that's how you keep your filter see you
guys<00:03:13.329> later
