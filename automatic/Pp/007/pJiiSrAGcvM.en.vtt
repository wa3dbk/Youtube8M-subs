00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello dear in today's video would like 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.839
 I'll show you how he made a few 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.519
 ingredients a delicious and simple 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.070
 super fast vegan fruit bread 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.519
 button might be needed for this bread 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.929
 her 500 grams of spelled wholemeal bread 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 milliliter of lukewarm water a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.160
 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 2 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 tablespoon apple cider 50 grams km to 50 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
 gram rosin 50 grams berries one pack 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 fresh yeast and some sunflower oil 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 you will also find the exact ingredients 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 again down in the innsbrucker than 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.809
 First of all you need a big one 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 bowl puts in the whole mail and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.590
 then found the individual ingredients 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 to add for the fruit bread 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 i am now looking for dried mauerberg 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.460
 cranberries and raisins decided her 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.590
 Of course you can change that as well 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.690
 you want that I finally found 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.969
 this combination was really correct 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 then you add the apple vinegar 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.870
 Of course, they are not afterwards 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 taste out the sugar with it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 the yeast can go well and some salt 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 so that, of course, something like 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.369
 tastes then give her the 500 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.299
 milliliter lukewarm water should we 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.970
 then the yeast rhine could be that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.340
 Of course, at the very beginning and make 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 then the whole thing is only stirred by 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 This time not clarified as usual 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.100
 look but just a bit 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.829
 that's what mine means 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.420
 kitchenaid that's a hare there just 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.640
 and is very fast 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.790
 then we take a box shape and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.869
 put some sunflower oil in it 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 pass the whole with a brush 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.070
 so that the bread is not longer afterwards 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.130
 tackles and then we go already 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.479
 the day into it 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.890
 so now does not have to go from where 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.399
 the practical thing about this bread is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.100
 that's why it's super fast 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.560
 when the whole day is in shape 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.590
 give her then some oil on top 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.380
 so that does not get so brown and above 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.049
 also does not tackle distributes the whole 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.590
 with a brush and that should be in the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.509
 preheated oven at 175 degrees for 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.760
 Bake for about 50 minutes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.220
 This is how the bread looks when it is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.230
 fresh from the oven 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.300
 it just looks delicious 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.100
 and of course it also tastes great league 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.230
 on 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.630
 The whole thing has a super fruity note 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.390
 through all the dried fruits 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.750
 who are in there and you can do it 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.820
 just so enjoy or give something 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.990
 marine on it or prove otherwise 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.970
 according to your wishes 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.320
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.510
 We like to leave in the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.430
 Comment your feedback and write 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
 me necessarily in the comments whether we 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.360
 even your bread bakes and what is there 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.430
 your favorite combinations are 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.860
 I had a lot in part already 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.270
 I'll try a similar one 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.650
 Now you look a broad again 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.959
 but before that if you have one more 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.100
 wanted to try other variant and 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.100
 then I'll say until next time
