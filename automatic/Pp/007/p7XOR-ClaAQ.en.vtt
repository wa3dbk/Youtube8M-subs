00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.760
 i 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.680
 hi many, how good is this? 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.870
 very fast video you know that on Monday 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.660
 he played diet video and nothing 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.570
 I almost finished weight right now 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.200
 last week I weighed 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:32.880
 63 800 and well this week I have come down 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:35.910
 I'm down to 63 200 what are and many 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.570
 so many pesos and in the end I do not remember 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.680
 well 600 grams less and I have not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.630
 behaved well this week because good to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 watch 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:55.610
 the diet as I say it to see started very 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.610
 well eating a lot of vegetables and fruit 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.609
 being a little stricter 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.430
 and well and now we start when 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.830
 we go to the purchase we take to the best 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.320
 some thing of frozen a rice three 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.370
 delights or some of this we think or 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.500
 be with the points calculator 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.740
 and we eat it 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.270
 it is not that we exceed the points of 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 day but I think it's good that that can not 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.370
 be good that someday it's worth but 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.860
 is 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.300
 and nothing besides Saturday and Sunday 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.150
 we were outside we were 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.900
 out there with a hotel night like that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.600
 typical of these life packages 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.300
 It's beautiful to plan to see this because our 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.190
 No, no, not long ago, I think 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.190
 to see I do not know I think for kings 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.900
 I think so and we will not find the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.430
 moment also for work issues and 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.510
 all that 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.140
 but well we left and I also 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.050
 came a week a little bit bad 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.869
 encouragement and I needed to disconnect 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.730
 I needed to get out of here from Barcelona or 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.250
 from my house I needed to go out and well we 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.140
 we went to stop if you know from here I suppose 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 that you will know but if not 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.940
 I recommend that you go to that town 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.330
 because I loved it I had never been 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.990
 to vilanova and I feel it 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.870
 and well I liked that we ate at 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.840
 side of the beach but next is that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.830
 only one little road stopped and I was 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.310

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.360

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.780
 also very quiet there was no noise in 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.520
 the street or anything besides was just 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.150
 in front of the beach from the window 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.150
 I saw the beach 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.730
 We ate from restaurant menu so 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.680
 Let's try drinking coca cola 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.260
 whatever, but let's have an ice cream 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.740
 in the afternoon, an ice cream with two balls 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.780
 the afternoon 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.680
 the part of the food after we have 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.680
 Pizza 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.730
 then we had breakfast because the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.560
 breakfast included in hotel night 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.680
 osa have breakfast cross and ham 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.080

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.140
 diego jolin on when we got here 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.269
 that it was Sunday noon or so for the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.330
 night we ate the pizza that we did not know 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.240
 there were left over from there 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.580
 and I said my mother today when pps and I go 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.250
 to think how I'm going back to the start 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.630
 the 70 kilos almost good because no 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.380
 we both expected to have gained weight 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:12.600
 and he has not come down as much as me but he has 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.670
 lowered and me then 600 grams is super 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.330
 well because it's almost almost every 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.900
 week that is very good I'm already in 63 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.090
 200 I see around the 62 approaching in 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.880
 next week I guess they are already 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.520
 in 62 and what I notice is that I'm going 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.410
 to have to do a lot more exercise if 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.990
 some of you know about these things that I 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.360
 say because I've noticed that going down 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.540
 of kilos is already an amount of kilos 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.280
 considerable to me and that what I 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.820
 I wanted to go down to what I am 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.290
 going down 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.060
 and I feel the meat more flabby 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.150
 so I say I do not know if it's time 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.440
 of doing things like this from cardio 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.010
 toning and such to be put 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.350
 the meat lasts good then like no longer 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.770
 I have no idea of ​​that or exercises 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.900
 not even that I wanted to comment or 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.270
 also in case you know or some 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.320
 It has happened to lose weight because it has 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.260
 flaccid and nothing because that's my 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.610
 summary of this week's diet today 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.860
 Here is good in Barcelona and Catalonia 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.870
 Well, it's Sant Jordi, so now 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.520
 there's a little bit I'm going to make up because 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.610
 I have a dead face that flip eyes 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 surely and nothing because we see each other in a 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.330
 next video
