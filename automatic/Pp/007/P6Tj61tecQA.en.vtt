00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.029
 in the hospital is a complex organization at ministries specialist 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.960
 make use of various research equipment in parts 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 investigate patient support 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.980
 research data can only become part of the electronic 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.140
 patient file when they are selected via e-mail 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 judith list is filmed from the agenda it's ten minutes 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.800
 Research Council 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.400
 it is not something to be sure that the pilots must be at the right price 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.730
 being saved 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.490
 when doctors prefer, these images can become part of it 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.020
 digital file of the patient and so approachable words for others authorized 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.550
 physicians or the patient himself 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.940
 els hospital you will find 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.280
 hundreds of devices that research results and produce that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.460
 can be results in the form of data and graphs in a dynamic measurement 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.260
 ciale 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.050
 images themselves streaming video 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.150
 they run research results are available 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.490
 the doctors can immediately see the results it is here ppd wherever they are in the house 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.990
 be at that moment 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.979
 The problem is just all the research results that are on this 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.509
 moment she was on paper on cd rom on a usb stick which is tricky 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.600
 digitizing therefore requires a kind of infrastructure, a kind of party 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780
 ticks the hours that make it possible for us 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.720
 all these research results come out in the new square 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 unlocked via twitter as quickly as possible 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.610
 custom limbo sixty parking spaces that have been developed in our house 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.890
 hot by the movie 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.920
 and that enables us to digitize the research results 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 so whether they are friends on CD ROMs or USB sticks 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.260
 digitally made by FC and thus directly linked to 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.190
 the rehearsal 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.770
 before we have doctors as a team the research results need with that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.199
 They are available directly with DVD 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.199
 wherever it is in the house at that time 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.279
 a dive 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:29.179
 make over we know the movie but rvc will now be your head 10 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.309
 we were the first department in the Netherlands as a potter in that department 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.989
 utilizing in the system 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.399
 we use that for our bilt storage 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:43.269
 the microscopic particles that they but later also for macroscopic images 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.699
 that we can do that 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.159
 info give our pathology the report 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.030
 that is from the decentralized system 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.649
 if he is the country from the pathology registration system 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.649
 that we can store images in that decentralized system 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.929
 the advantage of that is the first outing 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.669
 yes what we used to do in discussions let all those little dutch people 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.679
 we project that and now we can, in fact, is the most essential picture 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:14.009
 from a particular case select one that made 3 and 4 and zele images from it 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.599
 I just have that as far too busy available for a meeting 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.379
 except that two in the growers is that our standards can help in the fast 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.620
 look up percent information for those you can't post messages yet 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.689
 places first it is still there is something else very important 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.459
 the excellent the image the system became storage systems that quite 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.979
 user-friendly competition and us in our profession 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.499
 previously image intensive detective work and was very happy to finish this week with 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.319
 our colleagues and that is how human rights go very quickly 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.319
 to respect 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.350
 typical of the initiative is the job 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.700
 That allows the employees to be constantly ready to provide quality patients 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.469
 provide high-quality care 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.349
 this creates a defense formation about the treatments at the 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.669
 enter the price 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.089
 it's an answer 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.589
 is a number of places 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:14.989
 these applications for 435 when purchasing a serious social 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.129
 work 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.129
 andries fired are linked to a transfer 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.520
 fortified cities counts from this 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.050
 as expected 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.620
 that data takes the form of a shipbuilder 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.590
 ans 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.759
 the specialist to support the four front cruciate ligament 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.539
 Only like these two departments and they put very importantly that district supervisor 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.590
 live 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.590
 that never made the compact setting good 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.729
 Sure it was a state of the many Marechaussee but then structure one 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.430
 accident 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.919
 and thanks to the worldwide standard that they apply there is information 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.919
 exchange with the caregivers 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.180
 each time stamp on us that two applications fall back 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.880
 because a great deal of taxes to be entertained and connect seamlessly 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.879
 get on the middle spot 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.409
 our experience with two us for a specialist is about fifteen 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.870
 in line with their work processes 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 because i can't argue will be 8 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.280
 In addition to the interest surcharge, not every system offers extensive options 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.379
 structured reporting 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:32.830
 4 knowledge come these are predefined which text cloths doctors quickly and 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.749
 efficiently report on its findings 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:37.139
 after three 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.189
 The report can be sent automatically to the doctor or other applicants 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:42.229
 sent 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.419
 the data can also be used for research and statistics 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.630
 recognized coaches this is yes 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.940
 a user-friendly, uncluttered sound may sound like this is the ideal finish 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.610
 to list at a glance click here 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.800
 the following model the hospital 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.350
 Sure, the stunt is of course a short-term solution 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.960
 maybe something like that shopping a stunt is the ideal for us 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.749
 link with a thorough preliminary investigation
