00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.359
 hi friends from youtube today I come with a 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.610
 new very simple tutorial of how 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.830
 install the Tengais and three patches 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.470
 since I received many orders for 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.689
 do the tutorial that we will need 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.300
 study to be able to open the file of the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.300
 intur patch to rebuild the iso 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.150
 we should already have our game iso 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.210
 now we will unzip the file 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.470
 I will extract it here will begin to create 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.470
 the game folders 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.079
 these files will remain as follows 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.079
 will open the patch 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.610
 already here we will see this simply 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.590
 patch what I look for the folder 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.860
 dates of the game that we have decompressed 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.870
 previously he will tell us that one of the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.090
 files is not found so 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.980
 we will have to look for it manually 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.980
 the same with the other that says the same thing 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.229
 much much more 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.049
 and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.630
 and ready you will have patched your game 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.800
 reconstruct missing is made good 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.800
 just follow my steps 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 d 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.500
 we look for the game folder and click on 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.900
 select folder 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.040
 we look for a place to keep we give 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.040
 a name and ready 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.700
 we hope it charges and it will be ready 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.630
