about the process of TIG welding Chris

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.180 
about the process of TIG welding Chris
can<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.260> tell<00:00:10.500> us<00:00:10.530> what<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.800> difference<00:00:11.130> is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.450 
can you tell us what the difference is
between<00:00:11.250> TIG<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:11.940> mig<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:13.160> tickling<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.280> when

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
between TIG and mig is tickling is when

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.110 
between TIG and mig is tickling is when
you<00:00:14.549> use<00:00:14.580> gas<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.540> feel<00:00:16.320> wrong

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.120

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
okay all right what is different about

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.000 
okay all right what is different about
TIG<00:00:23.540> or<00:00:23.810> what<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.260> know<00:00:24.380> what<00:00:24.560> what<00:00:24.770> is<00:00:24.980> it

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
TIG or what you know what what is it

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.490 
TIG or what you know what what is it
what<00:00:25.130> makes<00:00:25.700> it<00:00:25.850> better<00:00:26.350> as<00:00:27.350> you<00:00:27.380> get<00:00:27.560> better

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
what makes it better as you get better

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.490 
what makes it better as you get better
for<00:00:30.500> full<00:00:31.120> okay<00:00:32.120> all<00:00:32.660> right<00:00:32.840> can<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.290> give<00:00:33.410> us

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
for full okay all right can you give us

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.800 
for full okay all right can you give us
a<00:00:33.560> little<00:00:33.650> bit<00:00:33.770> of<00:00:33.830> a<00:00:33.920> demonstration<00:00:34.400> yes<00:00:34.810> all

got<00:01:18.500> penetration<00:01:19.040> on<00:01:19.220> every<00:01:19.520> one<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.760> those<00:01:19.850> as

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
got penetration on every one of those as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.940 
got penetration on every one of those as
opposed<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> big<00:01:20.869> you're<00:01:21.500> just<00:01:21.650> going<00:01:21.800> to<00:01:21.860> be

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
easy but I've done a little TIG welding

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.190 
easy but I've done a little TIG welding
myself<00:02:45.910> what<00:02:46.910> how<00:02:47.480> longs<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.810> take<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.110> to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
myself what how longs it take you to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.330 
myself what how longs it take you to
learn<00:02:48.230> how<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.680> something<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.099> this

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
learn how to do something like this

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.070 
learn how to do something like this
something<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.630> check<00:02:50.840> while<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
something like this the check while the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.050 
something like this the check while the
aspect<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.950> without<00:02:52.190> amendment<00:02:52.790> first

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
aspect of it without amendment first

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.690 
aspect of it without amendment first
okay<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.110> took<00:02:54.290> me<00:02:54.349> about<00:02:54.650> six<00:02:54.980> months<00:02:55.190> okay

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
okay it took me about six months okay

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.190 
okay it took me about six months okay
how<00:02:58.700> long<00:02:58.910> 14<00:02:59.750> 14<00:03:00.140> years<00:03:02.620> ok<00:03:04.630> now<00:03:05.630> I'm<00:03:05.810> assuming

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
how long 14 14 years ok now I'm assuming

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.479 
how long 14 14 years ok now I'm assuming
you're<00:03:06.530> gonna<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.830> do<00:03:06.950> some<00:03:07.160> make<00:03:07.310> work

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
you're gonna have to do some make work

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.000 
you're gonna have to do some make work
on<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:07.959> well<00:03:08.959> they're<00:03:09.350> on<00:03:09.470> these<00:03:09.620> lids<00:03:09.830> as

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
on this well they're on these lids as

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.850 
on this well they're on these lids as
well<00:03:10.220> that's<00:03:10.670> okay<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:12.080> roughly<00:03:12.500> how<00:03:12.799> many

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
well that's okay and roughly how many

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.130 
well that's okay and roughly how many
leads<00:03:13.130> do<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.400> personally<00:03:13.940> do<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.239> day<00:03:17.140> okay

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
leads do you personally do a day okay

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.170 
leads do you personally do a day okay
all<00:03:18.620> right<00:03:18.860> well<00:03:19.069> I<00:03:19.459> think<00:03:19.580> what<00:03:19.819> we'll<00:03:19.940> do<00:03:20.060> is

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
all right well I think what we'll do is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.400 
all right well I think what we'll do is
come<00:03:20.330> back<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.660> visit<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.989> later<00:03:21.170> when

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
come back and visit you later when
