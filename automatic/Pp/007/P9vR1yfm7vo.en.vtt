00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.670
 Euro 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.409
 the time for a jaunt takes the boss was easy 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:15.569
 today with the entry-level model of Lamborghini price around 170000 euros 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 Power 560 hp 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.460
 For almost five years Lamborghini has a German CEO 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.980
 and Stefan Wiedemann drives the private label also clearly 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.360
 it is as it is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 who very positive feeling what I have in the morning 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.650
 when I go to the office 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.990
 and it is also important that he has a sublime feeling when we have today 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.410
 Again, van Essen lifts the mood 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.410
 there it is, I believe, too, what shall we say be reading 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.700
 Now many are saving Winkelmann has to sell luxury 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 the sales figures go back but CharitÃ© Testo quantities part of the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 Company philosophy 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.660
 they would see fewer and fewer farmers 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 it was the 1 his eyes of our business 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 because the exclusivity can be from 1 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.930
 in the northern Italian countryside pulls the plant of Lamborghini 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 around 1000 employees work 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.400
 Schiphorst after five years Winkelmann came from 14 am 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.280
 Sports car manufacturer produced at that time simply too expensive 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.930
 Winkelmann cut costs and brought the luxury brand up to scratch 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.650
 I always believe in a few points 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.330
 at the price they just want the production 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.470
 which models in the series are so which way we currently have 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.970
 Adi it looks like the build quality when we go somewhere 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.530
 know that there are problems 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.780
 and as such was to ask the question Hoberg always wants to know where we stand 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.430
 that's one of the things 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 clear list Dr 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.840
 because the running numbers ask questions indicates 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 that the fourth car altogether just built 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.279
 Lamborghini produced around 2,400 of them last year 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.370
 Large manufacturers produce this amount in a single day 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.079
 but manual labor costs time 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.079
 Only ten models leave the factory hall per day 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.569
 Improvements are aptly made with the production manager 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.920
 one speaks Italian 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.390
 Of course I wave you that was born in Germany and in Italy 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.529
 grew up 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.419
 not that one 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.489
 even though he has to make it clear to one third of the employees like most recently 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.039
 she has to work short 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.769
 this language barrier 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.889
 he is not clear is not given 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.649
 I know the mentality 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.769
 but on the other side we are looking for our voters 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.099
 Not after nearly being out on his skills would Americans be on 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.919
 Board the Dutch at the word of course, German Italians above all things 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.029
 Italians over 95 percent 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.199
 our employees are the losers but this is about world-wide 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.509
 You also have to be able to handle the boy's parents 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.499
 not just to get along with suffrage 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.499
 because Lamborghini is now a worldwide known brand 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.259
 over a quarter of the production was old goes to the US 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.109
 But this market is Winkelmann's problem 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:35.910
 last 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.910
 30% drop in sales and more 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 That's why the lamborghini chef is currently traveling around the world 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.669
 Affects wealthy customers ever personally 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.129
 Entrepreneurs professional athletes scowl 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.369
 pbe 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:01.309
 Currently, every single sold and Winkelmann sees itself as 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.309
 A figurehead of his exclusive product 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:07.219
 v 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.569
 good luck 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.749
 you have to feel good that must be visible 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:17.769
 but also customers can be in the series of profits 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.739
 We are working for this brand and that is actually a light full 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.449
 occupied 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.259
 That's why he wants to be more than ready with his Make the World 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.650
 been 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.379
 conviction work with the most important customers should be easy for him 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.599
 Winkelmann bravely spent ten days in the USA
