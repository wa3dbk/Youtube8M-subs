00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 Hello, how are you androids? 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 that very well I am very happy 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.140
 because we already reached 100 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.779
 subscribers in three months so this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 is the special without subscribers maybe 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 for now not much asked support 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 we will be more 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 so I invite you to subscribe and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 share video with friends me 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.280
 it would help too, also leave me a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.610
 like if the video helped you so without 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.079
 more than saying let's start good at this 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 video I bring you the first 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.210
 root applications of the channel I hope that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.579
 they like it if you still have not surrounded 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.670
 by android in the description I will leave a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.250
 link how to do a method that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 it really works and you can check it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.519
 in the comments of people who 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.800
 they have seen and tested the method ok 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.060
 applications are two and they are very good 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.730
 one of them is the installer exposed and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.640
 the other one is that I see it team windows 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.160
 in this video I will show you how to make 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.130
 when running an application of your android 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.670
 run as a window and what 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.130
 we will achieve with these applications in 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.620
 another video I will explain how to have screen 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.500
 divided it seems that it is the same but not 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.440
 it's like this try the two ways to see which one 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.310
 it's better for you first of all 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.610
 exposed installer is only so that the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.460
 excel work and for another detail that 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.700
 I'll explain later first let's see how 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.370
 the good xl works the interface of the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.470
 application is the following in the first 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.660
 option we can configure the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.000
 transparency of the window this 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.560
 transparency of the application that is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.010
 behind the windows 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.229
 and the position 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.440
 that will have the window at the moment of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.750
 open it in the second option we will have 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.300
 the ability to configure the size 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.760
 of the window when opening it in 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 this case I have everything in 100% 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.430
 because when opening some 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.190
 applications windows appear 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.080
 the windows occupy the whole screen in 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.540
 the third option we will have some 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.130
 slightly more advanced configurations and 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.280
 more complicated 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.740
 the first one that says pau sing is 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.210
 pause the application that is behind 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.580
 of the Windows 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.300
 the other configurations I left for 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.220
 defect what interests us most is 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.260
 the white list of the blacklist in the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.290
 white list I do not have any application 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.630
 added by on the blacklist so 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.540
 I have the ones I do not want to be 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.659
 open in a window 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.480
 in the last option I have configured 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.579
 that all applications open in 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.370
 window mode except the ones I have in 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.799
 is black if you want to deactivate the former 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.290
 taylor you just have to press the 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.870
 last option in the fourth option 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.379
 we will have the possibility to customize 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.629
 the window as is the case with the color of 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.359
 window border option for 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.870
 buttons and so on if we want the 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.329
 window moves among other things in the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.359
 fifth option I only have activated 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:38.010
 this configuration that says you have 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:41.340
 a halo since it will provide us 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.250
 of a transparency menu for the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.939
 window and minimize buttons 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.310
 maximize and close and the last one is a 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.739
 test area with all the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.560
 configurations that I have so that's how 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.510
 would my window be in this part could 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.730
 configure transparency 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.730
 in this corner here I have three 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.849
 buttons that are to minimize maximize and 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.250
 close and in this corner I can 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.950
 set the size of the window to my 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.950
 Like I have another open window 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.209
 then the application of the calculator and 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.780
 so I can do two things at once 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.780
 very comfortably 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.610
 i 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.960
 the installer exposed as I said before 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.960
 will help us so that the modules do not 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.659
 observe here I have a few 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.110
 modules among them the excel or was 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.110
 having 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:15.100
 when you download the sposer installer 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.740
 first they go to frame words 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.890
 and here it will not disappear active 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.950
 will disappear in red you will have to 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.310
 install update and then give it a 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.310
 restart 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.990
 here where it says download us 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.510
 we will have the possibility to download 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.850
 a variety of modules that we 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.830
 they will be very helpful 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.380
 well up here the video today I hope 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:46.080
 that has been very helpful 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.080
