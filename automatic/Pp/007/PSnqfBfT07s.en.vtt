00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
buffed on was its two strongest stats

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.960 
buffed on was its two strongest stats
anyway<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.650> were

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
attack is a Monstress 175 that is

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.860 
attack is a Monstress 175 that is
ridiculous

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
ridiculous

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.500 
ridiculous
that<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.560> stronger<00:02:22.250> than<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.460> timid<00:02:22.850> life<00:02:23.210> orb

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
that is stronger than a timid life orb

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.320 
that is stronger than a timid life orb
Alakazam<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.470> if<00:02:25.460> you're<00:02:25.640> running<00:02:25.760> modest

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
Alakazam and if you're running modest

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.120 
Alakazam and if you're running modest
you're<00:02:26.570> also<00:02:26.780> faster<00:02:27.590> than<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.980> default

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
you're also faster than the default

you're also faster than the default
timid<00:02:28.850> mega<00:02:29.210> our<00:02:29.600> regular<00:02:30.440> Alakazam<00:02:30.980> which<00:02:31.940> is

timid mega our regular Alakazam which is

timid mega our regular Alakazam which is
why<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.240> would<00:02:32.450> recommend<00:02:32.660> running<00:02:33.020> modest

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
why I would recommend running modest

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.850 
why I would recommend running modest
because<00:02:33.860> you're<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.430> named<00:02:34.670> fast<00:02:35.030> that

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
because you're so named fast that

because you're so named fast that
nothing<00:02:36.860> pretty<00:02:37.490> much<00:02:37.610> nothing's<00:02:38.000> gonna<00:02:38.150> out

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
nothing pretty much nothing's gonna out

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.730 
nothing pretty much nothing's gonna out
speed<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:38.810> oh<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:38.960> accept<00:02:39.530> other

speed you in oh you accept other

speed you in oh you accept other
Alakazam<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.670> may<00:02:40.790> be<00:02:40.850> timid<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.750> think

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
Alakazam that may be timid but I think

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.810 
Alakazam that may be timid but I think
running<00:02:42.230> timid<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.220> bit<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.610> waste

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
running timid is a bit of a waste

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.120 
running timid is a bit of a waste
because<00:02:44.060> you're<00:02:44.810> only<00:02:44.960> gonna<00:02:45.230> speed<00:02:45.650> ty<00:02:45.860> with

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
because you're only gonna speed ty with

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.020 
because you're only gonna speed ty with
like<00:02:46.310> opposing<00:02:47.170> mega<00:02:48.170> Alakazam<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.190> if

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
like opposing mega Alakazam and if

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.270 
like opposing mega Alakazam and if
they're<00:02:50.600> if<00:02:50.750> they<00:02:50.930> are<00:02:51.050> timid<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.680> opposing

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
they're if they are timid and opposing

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.790 
they're if they are timid and opposing
Jiali<00:02:53.060> like<00:02:53.420> mega<00:02:53.690> Aerodactyl<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.560> that's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
Jiali like mega Aerodactyl and that's

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.650 
Jiali like mega Aerodactyl and that's
about<00:02:55.010> it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
about it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.080 
about it
I<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.470> from<00:02:57.680> modest<00:02:58.100> for<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> big<00:02:58.760> boost

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
I was just from modest for the big boost

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.390 
I was just from modest for the big boost
in<00:02:59.330> power<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.870> get<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.560> get<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.740> mighty<00:03:01.100> like

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
in power you get you get a mighty like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.400 
in power you get you get a mighty like
almost<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.090> think<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.360> almost<00:03:02.570> 50<00:03:03.110> extra

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
almost I think it's almost 50 extra

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.610 
almost I think it's almost 50 extra
points<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.010> special<00:03:04.370> attack<00:03:04.690> nearing<00:03:05.690> 500

and<00:03:06.770> like<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.700> said<00:03:07.760> that's<00:03:08.060> more<00:03:08.300> powerful

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
and like I said that's more powerful

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.070 
and like I said that's more powerful

there's not that many

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.810 
there's not that many
especially<00:04:27.710> defensive<00:04:28.130> Pokemon<00:04:28.520> right<00:04:28.700> now

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
especially defensive Pokemon right now

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.580 
especially defensive Pokemon right now
and<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.240> X&amp;Y<00:04:29.570> metagame<00:04:30.080> because<00:04:30.260> it's<00:04:30.380> very

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and the X&amp;Y metagame because it's very

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.130 
and the X&amp;Y metagame because it's very
offensive<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:31.760> would<00:04:32.420> run<00:04:32.540> psychic<00:04:33.020> just

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
offensive so I would run psychic just

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.980 
offensive so I would run psychic just
for<00:04:33.350> more<00:04:33.530> power<00:04:34.240> but<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> most<00:04:35.510> important

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
for more power but the most important

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.510 
for more power but the most important
move<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.290> set<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:36.680> my<00:04:36.920> opinion<00:04:37.400> is

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
move on the set in my opinion is

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.030 
move on the set in my opinion is
substitute<00:04:38.120> now<00:04:38.360> what<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.630> substitute<00:04:39.230> do<00:04:39.470> why

substitute now what a substitute do why
would<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.430> substitute<00:04:41.090> when<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:41.600> can<00:04:41.750> run

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960
