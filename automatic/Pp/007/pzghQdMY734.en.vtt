you can see it's a new angle i'm testing

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.850 
you can see it's a new angle i'm testing
out<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:35.969> new<00:00:36.149> angle<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
out this new angle because I kind of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
out this new angle because I kind of
like<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.040> his<00:00:38.579> top<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.450> view<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> move
