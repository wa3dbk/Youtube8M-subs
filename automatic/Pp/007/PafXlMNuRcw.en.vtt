00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.810 
first of all if you do not
want<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.270> use<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.630> Senate<00:02:20.020> clip<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.370> also

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
want to use the Senate clip you can also

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.740 
want to use the Senate clip you can also
use<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:23.430> default<00:02:24.430> group<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.150> can<00:02:25.300> also<00:02:25.510> use

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
use the default group you can also use

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.800 
use the default group you can also use
the<00:02:25.870> grip<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.350> here<00:02:26.560> too<00:02:26.800> now<00:02:27.460> if<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.210> want<00:02:28.390> if

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the grip on here too now if you want if

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.870 
the grip on here too now if you want if
you<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.080> grip<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.590> here<00:02:29.860> then<00:02:30.400> you're

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
you have a grip on here then you're

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.190 
you have a grip on here then you're
gonna<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.210> little<00:02:31.360> bit<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.540> recoil<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.020> mean

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
gonna have a little bit of recoil I mean

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.470 
gonna have a little bit of recoil I mean
okay<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> agri<00:02:33.670> ceiling<00:02:34.180> more

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
okay so you have the agri ceiling more

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
okay so you have the agri ceiling more
up<00:02:35.310> because<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.880> gun<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.750> gun<00:02:37.990> with<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> grip

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
up because the gun the gun with a grip

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.160 
up because the gun the gun with a grip
it's<00:02:38.830> better<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.610> with<00:02:40.300> toughness<00:02:40.630> on<00:02:40.959> it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it's better and with toughness on it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.770 
it's better and with toughness on it
makes<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.410> little<00:02:41.590> more<00:02:41.770> better<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:43.300> we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
makes a little more better so we we

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.280 
makes a little more better so we we
would<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.410> better<00:02:44.590> use<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.250> gun<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:46.290> grip

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
would you better use a gun with grip

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.060 
would you better use a gun with grip
like<00:02:47.830> what<00:02:47.980> agri<00:02:48.310> see<00:02:48.520> or<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.630> oh<00:02:49.930> no<00:02:50.200> it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
like what agri see or was like oh no it

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.860 
like what agri see or was like oh no it
will<00:02:51.370> ever<00:02:51.580> see<00:02:51.820> or<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.180> animal<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.690> know

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
will ever see or just animal if you know

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.650 
will ever see or just animal if you know
I<00:02:52.900> mean<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.610> title<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.330> grip

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
I mean so the title if I have a grip

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.540 
I mean so the title if I have a grip
will<00:02:56.080> make<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.440> go<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.830> little<00:02:56.980> bit<00:02:57.130> more<00:02:57.310> better

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
will make it go a little bit more better

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.340 
will make it go a little bit more better
because<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.570> need<00:02:58.720> accuracy

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
because you have that you need accuracy

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.860 
because you have that you need accuracy
a<00:02:59.380> little<00:02:59.830> more<00:02:59.980> accra<00:03:00.250> scenes<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
a little more accra scenes with that

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.210 
a little more accra scenes with that
besides<00:03:01.870> it'll<00:03:02.320> probably<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.800> more<00:03:02.980> accurate

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
besides it'll probably be more accurate

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.910 
besides it'll probably be more accurate
if<00:03:03.580> ya<00:03:03.670> grip<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.540> little<00:03:05.290> more<00:03:05.709> time

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
if ya grip on there and little more time

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.479 
if ya grip on there and little more time
to<00:03:06.040> kill<00:03:06.340> somebody<00:03:07.620> I'm<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.890> saying<00:03:09.130> but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
the anti-air missile now people are

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.380 
the anti-air missile now people are
gonna<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:43.720> using<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.769> UAV<00:03:45.549> span<00:03:46.030> that

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
gonna be using that the UAV span that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.880 
gonna be using that the UAV span that
you<00:03:46.720> AP<00:03:47.470> span<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.390> if<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.290> should<00:03:50.560> use

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
you AP span you this if you should use

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.090 
you AP span you this if you should use
this<00:03:51.130> one<00:03:51.400> against<00:03:51.940> UAB<00:03:52.110> then<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.320> are<00:03:53.350> 35

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
this one against UAB then you are 35

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.190 
this one against UAB then you are 35
points<00:03:54.459> if<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.209> think<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:55.720> like<00:03:55.900> any<00:03:56.110> other

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
points if you think it's like any other

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.190 
points if you think it's like any other
any<00:03:56.650> aircraft<00:03:57.160> like<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:58.200> um<00:03:59.340> so<00:04:00.340> chopper<00:04:00.820> or<00:04:01.200> as

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
any aircraft like a um so chopper or as

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.199 
any aircraft like a um so chopper or as
escort<00:04:02.860> drawing<00:04:03.190> you're<00:04:03.700> gonna<00:04:03.820> get<00:04:03.910> 50

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
escort drawing you're gonna get 50

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.539 
escort drawing you're gonna get 50
points<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:04.630> again<00:04:05.350> UAV<00:04:05.799> will<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.160> certain<00:04:06.400> five

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
points so again UAV will be certain five

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.080 
points so again UAV will be certain five
points<00:04:07.200> social<00:04:08.200> will<00:04:08.380> be<00:04:08.500> 50<00:04:08.829> points<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:09.340> my

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
points social will be 50 points so my

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.020 
points social will be 50 points so my
best<00:04:10.299> guess<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:11.110> use<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.560> disc<00:04:12.130> on<00:04:12.400> this

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
best guess is to use this disc on this

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.890 
best guess is to use this disc on this
anti-air<00:04:13.840> missile<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:15.579> kill<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.600> me<00:04:16.750> to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
anti-air missile to kill the me to

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.710 
anti-air missile to kill the me to
destroy<00:04:17.290> any<00:04:17.620> enemy<00:04:17.919> killstreak<00:04:18.640> one<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.479> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
destroy any enemy killstreak one on the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.409 
destroy any enemy killstreak one on the
