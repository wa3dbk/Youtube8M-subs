00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.739
 a kind of way different from 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 you can use it to build 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 several things 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 You also need to build this all. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
