00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:27.710
 Our daily lives require a lot of energy 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:31.800
 Connect with the 3 people who spend leisurely to go out somewhere , also to find out the war song to know the world 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:38.670
 I need energy to enjoy it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.650
 Thinking about the future of important energy and giving an answer 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 Emme is the male of work 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.490
 Eneos the energy nicely 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.490
 ben 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.070
 eme 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.040
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 I have little hope that I will connect with a goal- hick 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.680
 I bought it from the very beginning of the year 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:07.990
 Nde I was also often in the Toka goal kick me determine Te Long Barn 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:13.230
 I thought a little stricter for it 's such or try to connect as well as long as you can 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.960
 So it's still a thin ball so the house still has the best pace 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.950
 Will be 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.340
 The keeper will be seen as a plus one after all 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.359
 And but not'm there + solder 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 It is the 4th back, but it is not with the last person's nature entering keeper 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.409
 Does when such 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:40.260
 United States and the Soviet Union players Well similar to the think'm such a place role 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:43.280
 There is a place where I have been conscious for a long time personally, and this year is an absolute condition of love on earth 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:50.530
 Offensive and defensive rather than by 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:55.540
 It is an absolute condition to move a lot and for players who have stopped moving without movement 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.780
 The do not make change had quite be doing intently from Tteyuu out the still Coo 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.590
 My defense line is good at everyone 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 A player who would be good for Morishi or his mother 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.670
 Men's line everyone 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:17.490
 It can be attacking sex big ah Oh, it's okay to say cherry blossoms 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.810
 The reaction around me when I'm careless is really important, and no one in the rain says Jerry 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.180
 It is generated and covered 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 So someone to four players that have that kind of something Toka he enters 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.840
 I will definitely go 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.260
 Just that 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.750
 It's not just thinking about the attack, it's related to the attack or the hobbies against the ball 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:44.050
 The players who are not involved in this kind of attitude have become aware of becoming obsessive 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.050
 There is thought that's the place that must be Yara to continue 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.870
 Toka pressure for the one by one 's ball 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.370
 Then that 's why someone said that the next person is going to pressure again 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.390
 If you can not continue to work together after all, it will remain as it is 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.170
 When you are not able to 4 end can be defensive to say that when you are getting a troublesome 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.640
 Is true exerted say I stole through the ball 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.140
 But it is the way to do 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.069
 But the good thing is 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.810
 Is not it mon change Node Tteyuu because the other party has been something 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.810
 No place go home on their own initiative 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.350
 I can't get it if I slap 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.030
 So where you say the ball Bayrou After working hard is their 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.110
 So 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.530
 I think that there is worthwhile 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.709
 I thought that what came to say is my rewarding 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.750
 I have my own eyes, but in team 8 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.730
 I'm not letting it go 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.520
 How is this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.240
 It seems like I think it's a move 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.200
 I 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.370
 Not dark from there to not interesting Steal not dripping parts even say trying this 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:05.550
 Kana and I do not come I thought when you devised Do Toka opponent take you were here Hey 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:09.230
 With a little higher probability of having a little chance to enter what you think is a chance 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.770
 Gudaguda If you say it , where will you go that player Fresh 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.890
 Since Absolutely it does not 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:21.859
 If so, it would be better if someone other than the good player put pressure on it 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.880
 As long to do it from along hobby even eh if ball'm bitter it is to take the point calla and counter 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.830
 I think it will be gone 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.930
 I will not be able to take it from now on 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.529
 That is fine 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.179
 This is How 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:37.249
 Current situation that does not leave that to say is whether to not'm successful is but not still do it 

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:37.249
 I still think because there is 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.050
 spa day 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.050
 me 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:56.550
 Let professional housewives produce various dishes from natural ingredients 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:05:00.639
 Convert energy from the earth into a form suitable for each life and deliver it 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:05.529
 That's our job 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:08.339
 To each person of energy every single energy 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.339
 eneos 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.099
 Wear 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.490
 Do players of fence do not rejoice even if kept at 0? 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:24.910
 Something 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:30.160
 As there are places where I think that I want to fix in the game, the attacking players are probably so 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:35.840
 The Fu Tteyuu I ok because I bought Yappa also take a point 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:42.919
 Because here challenger such seriously do not face each other seriously in here i line 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:46.000
 My play and Nura Maa Even if you think there is something that everyone thinks, even if you get a goal behind 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.300
 I also need strength that can be reversed 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.080
 I am a team 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.330
 Not only the problem firmly this by human resources we have been defensive in Minna 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.360
 It is kept to a medium everyone 0 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:04.360
 But the Tteyuu revival would like to have everyone want out woman 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 ni 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:23.250
 Well, every game I only think about winning in the immediate game 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:26.590
 Purely the talk look is me than do for here being chased Once in the husband game this match 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.850
 It is better to continue preparing for 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.430
 I think can do to best it 100 percent every day I thought Kimon developers can 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.760
 You 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:40.780
 This is always something more than looking ahead 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:44.470
 And soon switched after anyway in the near term of the game short-sighted of the game 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:49.500
 There is a general way to do it 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.500
 I am always conscious of keeping good preparations 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.970
 cani 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.990
 me 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.990
 he 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.669
 me
