 another game 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.910
 a few days ago we brought us a 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.400
 game that was very addictive and it was called 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.630
 frontier trailers today we bring you swamp 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.420
 It's a very arcade shooter game but 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.030
 especially addictive for its simplicity its 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.130
 simplicity the truth I like the fact 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.950
 of playing with tops on the screen much more 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.120
 that control characters in order not me 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.250
 It seemed interesting that I 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.350
 show is free as I say and you go 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.700

 intro and nothing else to return already you are with the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.300
 video review 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.300
 of this game we are going 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.930
 good guys are attack is a very game 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.070
 very simple but entertaining at the time 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.300
 also now they are putting 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.820
 fashion this simple games 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.200
 simple in the end here we have the menu 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.510
 main we embody the life of a 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.880
 hunter that good is attacked in his 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.650
 cottage by crocodiles and so on and let's 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.150
 go having to shoot in a way 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.010
 very simple all of them and end up with 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.330
 all the enemies besides we are going to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.680
 when integrated with the part of Atil 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 to go unlocking also objects 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.820
 to be able to use and not just shots 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.240
 as you see the menu will not here us 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.220
 we have passed and unlocked the others 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.650
 menus is that I thought you could give 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.850
 I do not know why it is such the one to change 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.820
 of weapons to shoot two samples 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.350
 different has unlocked this I have not 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.250
 re-done episode 1 this is the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.619
 episode 1 guys 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.410
 It's worth as you see here we have us 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.430
 interact with touch screens 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.110
 simply by taping the screen 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.610
 we make a shot that we are going to make 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.800
 then also to our enemies who 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.590
 are the crocodiles these are we going to see 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.060
 how do you see we can go doing levels and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.040
 we can repeat them in order for 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.480
 example of getting explosive examples 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.310
 that I have there are two explosives for 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.770
 get unlock and I can use 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.450
 As you can see it is a very simple game but 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.480
 that entertains 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.849
 it's becoming fashionable to see a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.489
 phenomenon that already had a lot of exploration 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.440
 of its simplicity and this seems to me also 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.890
 very addictive and also free that more 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.750
 you can ask 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.550
 you see drag drop on the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.030
 explosive engines because nothing is going to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030
 try 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.950
 even if I have bad aim I'll give it to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.620
 one could see him lying on the floor and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.960
 more good since we have finished the menu 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.430
 level 1 is level 11 finished 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.950
 we have unlocked coins we give to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.500
 following us what we will be able to 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 do then is with these coins and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 unlocking improvements for our 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.560
 explosive shotguns and be able to get 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.540
 other more powerful weapons which is like 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.460
 a super additive shooter of low one 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.550
 little volume a super super 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.590
 addictive let's go over there let's see me now 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.150
 same I have 216 coins I do not think that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.760
 have for a lot of things I can buy 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.340
 ammunition for the moment I already have we are going to 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.780
 see specials here we can logically 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.130
 make purchases within the application 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.410
 to see what besides coins and so on 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.030
 but good for now we will continue 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.080
 playing we go to level 2 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.580
 you want to earn twice as many coins in 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.480
 well he got special double of 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.400
 I do not know what it is worth now to give the duckling 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.150
 You see here you have a description collects 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.939
 coins to buy new weapons and 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.379
 improvements you can also gain mole to 200 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.280
 rubber ducklings 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.170
 these are let's say like help menu 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.060
 we go there, power, every time there is more 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.590
 enemies as you see and every time it turns out 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.470
 harder because the shotgun has a 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.210
 you see quite slow pace there 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.570
 we see the indicator of our bullets 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.550
 let's throw an explosive to this vale 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.900
 let's wait for more enemies while 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.329
 recharge 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.640
 let's go there let's get there toma toma toma 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.740
 take shot 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.000
 and finally guys I do not know what else to say 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.530
 this game as you see is a very game 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.450
 simple very simple but I think very 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.860
 addictive and how are you asking me to 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.079
 occasionally bring a game that 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.540
 I never bring games here to the channel 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.980
 support 5 but not so good that you know 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.240
 you already have the second game because 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.190
 I wanted to climb also in the game 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.479
 I do not remember the name was from the uncle 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.789
 still in charge an adventure with a 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.240
 good bicycle with a motorcycle and 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.860
 that was going forward more and more so what 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.060
 I will now leave on the double screen until 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.639
 that I put shadow at the end in case 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.050
 you want to see it anyway 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.690
 dismissal you know is liked the video 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.000
 can you give me a like here is me 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.130
 like and nothing for my part a turtle 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.750
 murderous we go there takes already 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.180
 for my part, not much else they have to follow 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.680
 also a little bit this and see you in 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.680
 a next video as always enap or 51 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.000
