and he's been asking a battle for a long
time<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.830> he<00:00:20.789> finally<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.180> called<00:00:21.449> me<00:00:21.510> at

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
time and he finally just called me at

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
time and he finally just called me at
the<00:00:21.630> right<00:00:21.960> time<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.590> I'd<00:00:22.830> lead<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.160> jirachi

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the right time so I'd lead with jirachi

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.050 
the right time so I'd lead with jirachi
he<00:00:24.470> switches<00:00:25.470> into<00:00:25.769> blaziken<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:26.880> my

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
he switches into blaziken to take my

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
he switches into blaziken to take my
iron<00:00:27.240> head<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.869> he<00:00:28.680> gets<00:00:28.859> he<00:00:28.920> predicted<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
iron head and he gets he predicted it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.859 
iron head and he gets he predicted it
pretty<00:00:29.609> well<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.240> did<00:00:30.390> end<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.660> going

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
pretty well because I did end up going

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
pretty well because I did end up going
for<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> iron<00:00:31.289> head<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.130> he<00:00:32.279> goes<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
for the iron head so he goes for the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.459 
for the iron head so he goes for the
Fire<00:00:32.910> Blast<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.899> very<00:00:33.960> effective

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
Fire Blast and that's not very effective

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
Fire Blast and that's not very effective
on<00:00:34.829> salamence<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.410> he<00:00:37.410> withdraws<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> I'm

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
on salamence and he withdraws and I'm

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.190 
on salamence and he withdraws and I'm
thinking<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.690> means<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.050> probably

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
thinking that means it's probably

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.229 
thinking that means it's probably
scarfed<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.610> gonna<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
scarfed and I'm just gonna go for the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
scarfed and I'm just gonna go for the
dragon<00:00:42.629> dance<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.140> kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> suspected

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
dragon dance because I kind of suspected

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.639 
dragon dance because I kind of suspected
it<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.100> scarf<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.719> anyway<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.170> goes<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it with scarf but anyway he goes into a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.100 
it with scarf but anyway he goes into a
gyarados<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.930> feel<00:00:49.050> like

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
gyarados and I really don't feel like

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.330 
gyarados and I really don't feel like
staying<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.340> salamence<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.219> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
staying in with salamence so and that is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
staying in with salamence so and that is
because<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.969> porygon<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.539> which<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.960> an

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
because i have porygon to which is an

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
because i have porygon to which is an
epic<00:00:55.500> gyarados<00:00:55.890> counter<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.640> say<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
epic gyarados counter if I don't say so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240 
epic gyarados counter if I don't say so
myself<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.960> he<00:00:58.050> goes<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.410> dragon<00:00:58.620> dance<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
myself so he goes for a dragon dance and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
myself so he goes for a dragon dance and
I<00:00:59.699> really<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.390> he's<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.660> stay<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I really don't think he's gonna stay in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
I really don't think he's gonna stay in
so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> decided<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> thunder<00:01:02.460> wave

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so I decided to go for the thunder wave

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.630 
so I decided to go for the thunder wave
just<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.870> paralyze<00:01:04.710> something<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> switch

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
just to paralyze something on the switch

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
just to paralyze something on the switch
but<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> actor<00:01:06.900> stays<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> guess<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but the actor stays in so I guess you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
but the actor stays in so I guess you
just<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> epicness<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
just know the epicness that is the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
just know the epicness that is the
porygon<00:01:09.689> too<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.369> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
porygon too and I'm just going to go for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
porygon too and I'm just going to go for
the<00:01:11.610> discharge<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.450> he<00:01:13.170> lives<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> barely

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the discharge and he lives it barely

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
the discharge and he lives it barely
just<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:14.670> poor<00:01:14.909> guns<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.509> special<00:01:16.080> attack

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
just because poor guns to special attack

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890 
just because poor guns to special attack
isn't<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.159> completely<00:01:17.700> great<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
isn't you know completely great and this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
isn't you know completely great and this
is<00:01:19.140> Evie<00:01:19.680> didn't<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.040> defense<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> HP<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
get the paralyzed anyway so it's pretty

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
get the paralyzed anyway so it's pretty
awesome<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> means<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> be

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
awesome and that means I'm going to be

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
awesome and that means I'm going to be
able<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.890> speed<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> ice

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.429 
able out speed and I just go for the ice
beam<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.780> case<00:01:27.930> he<00:01:27.960> feels<00:01:28.229> like

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
beam just in case he feels like

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.340 
beam just in case he feels like
switching<00:01:28.909> but<00:01:29.909> he<00:01:29.970> doesn't<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.170> kill

in just in case he feels like going for
the<00:02:10.410> hypnosis<00:02:10.739> again<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.310> then<00:02:11.400> he<00:02:11.459> gets

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the hypnosis again but then he gets

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.700 
the hypnosis again but then he gets
paralyzed<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.420> that's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
paralyzed so that's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.650 
paralyzed so that's
good<00:02:12.890> at<00:02:12.980> all<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:14.000> I'm<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.210> gonna<00:02:14.300> set<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
good at all and I'm just gonna set the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.880 
good at all and I'm just gonna set the
leech<00:02:14.810> seed<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:16.450> pretty<00:02:17.450> much<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.110> see

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
leech seed and pretty much just to see

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.740 
leech seed and pretty much just to see
what<00:02:19.010> he<00:02:19.070> does<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.730> maybe<00:02:20.150> get<00:02:20.420> some<00:02:20.570> health

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
what he does and maybe get some health

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.780 
what he does and maybe get some health
back<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.380> he<00:02:21.560> goes<00:02:21.710> for<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> shadow<00:02:22.160> ball<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
back and he goes for the shadow ball and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.090 
back and he goes for the shadow ball and
that<00:02:23.210> does<00:02:23.450> okay<00:02:23.960> damage<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.560> shame<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
that does okay damage to shame and I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.950 
that does okay damage to shame and I
guess<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.640> he's<00:02:26.150> going<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.330> go<00:02:26.450> into<00:02:26.600> shaming

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
guess and he's going to go into shaming

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960 
guess and he's going to go into shaming
of<00:02:27.020> his<00:02:27.140> own<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.280> thought<00:02:28.520> he's<00:02:28.640> staying<00:02:28.880> in

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
of his own but I thought he's staying in

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.700 
of his own but I thought he's staying in
shadow<00:02:29.210> ball<00:02:29.420> again<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.960> went<00:02:30.200> for<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.410> rest

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
shadow ball again so I went for the rest

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.030 
shadow ball again so I went for the rest
but<00:02:31.160> instead<00:02:31.550> he<00:02:32.060> just<00:02:32.450> goes<00:02:32.690> into<00:02:33.230> shaymin<00:02:33.590> so

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
but instead he just goes into shaymin so

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.770 
but instead he just goes into shaymin so
I<00:02:34.070> switched<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.520> because<00:02:34.850> human<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.360> natural

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
I switched out because human is natural

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.860 
I switched out because human is natural
cure<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.030> doesn't<00:02:38.300> really<00:02:38.390> matter<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.780> whole

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
cure so it doesn't really matter a whole

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.160 
cure so it doesn't really matter a whole
lot<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.650> um<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.750> he's<00:02:41.870> asleep

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
lot if um you know that he's asleep

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.840 
lot if um you know that he's asleep
because<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:42.830> switch<00:02:43.100> out<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.520> get<00:02:43.700> rid<00:02:43.790> of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
because I can switch out and get rid of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.850 
because I can switch out and get rid of
the<00:02:43.940> sleep<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.390> mean<00:02:45.170> he<00:02:45.260> gets<00:02:45.440> scared<00:02:45.590> away

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
the sleep I mean he gets scared away

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.800 
the sleep I mean he gets scared away
from<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.370> Infernape<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.600> for<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
from the Infernape and I go for the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.750 
from the Infernape and I go for the
flamethrower<00:02:48.440> as<00:02:48.740> he<00:02:49.220> goes<00:02:49.370> back<00:02:49.580> into

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
flamethrower as he goes back into

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.520

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
blaziken and I see that it's going to be

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.380 
blaziken and I see that it's going to be
a<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.740> KO<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.520> decided<00:02:52.850> just<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.120> stay<00:02:53.360> in

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390

and see what he does and he actually
tried<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.110> predict<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.380> switch<00:02:57.620> into

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
tried to predict the switch into

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.740 
tried to predict the switch into
salamence<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.580> thank<00:02:59.210> God<00:02:59.450> he<00:02:59.480> ever

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
salamence and thank God he ever

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.390 
salamence and thank God he ever
predicted<00:03:00.170> there<00:03:00.410> because<00:03:00.740> I'm<00:03:00.860> able<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.190> take

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
predicted there because I'm able to take

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.300 
predicted there because I'm able to take
down<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.850> Infernape<00:03:02.300> with<00:03:02.480> flamethrower<00:03:03.310> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
down the Infernape with flamethrower and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.310 
down the Infernape with flamethrower and
unfortunately<00:03:05.270> for<00:03:05.510> me<00:03:05.630> though<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.020> furness

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
unfortunately for me though in furness

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.100 
unfortunately for me though in furness
going<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.560> be<00:03:06.650> taking<00:03:06.920> down<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.250> life<00:03:07.460> orb

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
going to be taking down the life orb

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.810 
going to be taking down the life orb
recoil<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.800> that's<00:03:10.100> pretty<00:03:10.280> worth<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.640> for<00:03:10.790> me

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
recoil but that's pretty worth it for me

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.280 
recoil but that's pretty worth it for me
because<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.180> got<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:11.810> rid<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:11.990> that<00:03:12.110> a

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
because I got to get rid of that a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.430 
because I got to get rid of that a
really<00:03:12.890> annoying<00:03:13.420> Blaziken<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.050> now<00:03:15.170> he<00:03:15.230> goes

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
really annoying Blaziken so now he goes

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.470 
really annoying Blaziken so now he goes
into<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:16.100> fire<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:16.820> I'm<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.030> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.180> go<00:03:17.330> for

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
into a fire and I'm just going to go for

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.060 
into a fire and I'm just going to go for
the<00:03:17.510> psychic<00:03:17.960> since<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.290> my<00:03:18.410> strongest<00:03:18.770> move

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
the psychic since it's my strongest move

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.850 
the psychic since it's my strongest move
and<00:03:19.340> he<00:03:19.400> goes<00:03:19.550> into<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:19.970> thing<00:03:20.240> and<00:03:20.860> score

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
and he goes into this thing and score

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.200 
and he goes into this thing and score
more<00:03:21.950> he<00:03:22.070> doesn't<00:03:22.280> have<00:03:22.370> great<00:03:22.670> special

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
more he doesn't have great special

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.120 
more he doesn't have great special
defense<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.690> fact<00:03:23.870> he<00:03:23.960> has<00:03:24.080> not<00:03:24.680> very<00:03:24.920> good

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
defense in fact he has not very good

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.950 
defense in fact he has not very good
special<00:03:25.400> defense<00:03:25.610> at<00:03:25.790> all<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.690> looks<00:03:26.900> like

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
special defense at all so it looks like

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.330 
special defense at all so it looks like
it<00:03:27.110> might<00:03:27.260> be<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.380> twix<00:03:27.650> heyo<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.190> got<00:03:28.310> a

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
it might be a twix heyo and then I got a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.620 
it might be a twix heyo and then I got a
special<00:03:28.520> defense<00:03:28.940> drop<00:03:29.240> so<00:03:29.390> now<00:03:29.510> it's

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
special defense drop so now it's

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.900 
special defense drop so now it's
definitely<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.350> akl<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.070> he<00:03:31.610> doesn't<00:03:31.820> even

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
definitely to akl and he doesn't even

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.700 
definitely to akl and he doesn't even
bother<00:03:32.090> switching<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.870> he<00:03:33.230> just<00:03:33.410> lets<00:03:33.560> his

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
bother switching and he just lets his

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.830 
bother switching and he just lets his
Gomory<00:03:34.100> die<00:03:34.340> which<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.940> pretty<00:03:35.240> good<00:03:35.390> for<00:03:35.540> me<00:03:35.810> I

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
Gomory die which is pretty good for me I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.070 
Gomory die which is pretty good for me I
must<00:03:36.110> say<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.250> now<00:03:37.460> he's<00:03:37.970> really<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.900> pickle

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
must say so now he's really in a pickle

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.830 
must say so now he's really in a pickle
he<00:03:39.350> goes<00:03:39.500> back<00:03:39.740> into<00:03:40.010> Shaymin<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:41.540> go<00:03:41.690> into

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
he goes back into Shaymin and I go into

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.130 
he goes back into Shaymin and I go into
jirachi<00:03:42.320> um<00:03:43.180> thinking<00:03:44.180> he<00:03:44.300> might<00:03:44.510> seed<00:03:44.870> flare

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
jirachi um thinking he might seed flare

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.510 
jirachi um thinking he might seed flare
and<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.530> really<00:03:45.800> don't<00:03:45.950> feel<00:03:46.070> like<00:03:46.130> taking<00:03:46.340> a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
and I really don't feel like taking a

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.330 
and I really don't feel like taking a
seed<00:03:46.760> flare<00:03:46.940> on<00:03:47.000> Alakazam<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.980> instead<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.280> just

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
seed flare on Alakazam so instead I just

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.920 
seed flare on Alakazam so instead I just
stay<00:03:49.610> in<00:03:49.670> jirachi<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.300> go<00:03:50.390> for<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.600> fire

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
stay in jirachi and go for the fire

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.990 
stay in jirachi and go for the fire
punch<00:03:51.260> he<00:03:51.920> goes<00:03:52.100> for<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.340> seed<00:03:52.610> flower<00:03:52.940> I

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
punch he goes for the seed flower I

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.030 
punch he goes for the seed flower I
guess<00:03:53.270> predicting<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.780> switch<00:03:54.170> because<00:03:54.500> he

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
guess predicting the switch because he

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.980 
guess predicting the switch because he
actually<00:03:55.190> used<00:03:55.610> hidden<00:03:55.940> power<00:03:56.120> fire<00:03:56.390> next<00:03:56.930> so

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
actually used hidden power fire next so

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.300 
actually used hidden power fire next so
we<00:03:57.080> try<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.290> predict<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.680> switch<00:03:57.890> there<00:03:58.160> and

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
we try to predict a switch there and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.370 
we try to predict a switch there and
then<00:03:58.400> went<00:03:58.640> for<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.850> seed<00:03:59.060> flare<00:03:59.350> but<00:04:00.350> I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
then went for the seed flare but I

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.900 
then went for the seed flare but I
didn't<00:04:00.680> give<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.950> him<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.310> go<00:04:01.460> for<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.730> fire

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
didn't give it to him I go for the fire

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.600 
didn't give it to him I go for the fire
punch<00:04:02.210> and<00:04:02.710> it's<00:04:03.710> super<00:04:03.920> effective<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.550> I'm

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
punch and it's super effective and I'm

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.430 
punch and it's super effective and I'm
just<00:04:04.700> going<00:04:04.820> to<00:04:04.940> keep<00:04:05.030> going<00:04:05.090> for<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.750> he<00:04:06.260> goes

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
just going to keep going for it he goes

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.470 
just going to keep going for it he goes
for<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.650> hidden<00:04:06.800> power<00:04:06.980> fire<00:04:07.400> does<00:04:08.270> some

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
for the hidden power fire does some

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.470 
for the hidden power fire does some
respectable<00:04:08.990> damage<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.560> jirachi<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:11.300> it's

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
respectable damage to jirachi but it's

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.450 
respectable damage to jirachi but it's
still<00:04:12.050> I'm<00:04:12.410> going<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.710> be<00:04:12.800> able<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.040> finish<00:04:13.220> him

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
still I'm going to be able to finish him

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.550 
still I'm going to be able to finish him
off<00:04:13.580> with<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.910> fire<00:04:14.300> punch<00:04:14.570> before<00:04:14.870> he<00:04:15.050> kills<00:04:15.380> me

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
off with a fire punch before he kills me

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.830 
off with a fire punch before he kills me
with<00:04:15.740> hidden<00:04:16.010> power<00:04:16.190> fire<00:04:16.520> I<00:04:16.850> figure<00:04:17.330> so<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.570> go

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
with hidden power fire I figure so I go

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.510 
with hidden power fire I figure so I go
for<00:04:18.020> it<00:04:18.080> again<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.590> he<00:04:19.040> actually<00:04:19.190> thought<00:04:19.370> I'd

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
for it again and he actually thought I'd

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.039 
for it again and he actually thought I'd
switch<00:04:19.790> again<00:04:20.060> because<00:04:20.480> he<00:04:20.600> tried<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.900> go<00:04:21.020> for

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
switch again because he tried to go for

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.140 
switch again because he tried to go for
the<00:04:21.230> sub<00:04:21.560> but<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.100> didn't<00:04:22.430> give<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.640> him<00:04:22.850> so

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
the sub but I didn't give it to him so

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.810 
the sub but I didn't give it to him so
that<00:04:23.390> pretty<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.380> sucks<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.919> lot<00:04:25.190> for<00:04:25.430> him

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
that pretty that sucks a lot for him

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.220 
that pretty that sucks a lot for him
I'm<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.510> I'm<00:04:26.570> going<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.780> be<00:04:26.900> able<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.110> take
