00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
just want to show you guys how to do
this<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.119> struggled<00:00:30.599> with<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.380> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this because I struggled with it but it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.380 
this because I struggled with it but it
is<00:00:31.560> pretty<00:00:31.769> simple<00:00:32.189> once<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> figure<00:00:33.360> out

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is pretty simple once you figure out

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.549 
is pretty simple once you figure out
obviously<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:33.960> you're<00:00:34.079> watching<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> video

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
obviously if you're watching this video

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.780 
obviously if you're watching this video
then<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.130> how<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.700> what

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
then you don't know how so that's what

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
then you don't know how so that's what
I'm<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> show<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.630> we're<00:00:37.320> going

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
I'm going to show you to do we're going

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.740 
I'm going to show you to do we're going
to<00:00:37.500> remove<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> mod<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.480> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to remove the mod so you can see it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
to remove the mod so you can see it's
not<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.530> list<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.340> under<00:00:41.640> oh<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
not in my list at all not under oh and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.819 
not in my list at all not under oh and
it's<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.629> anywhere<00:00:43.079> else<00:00:43.230> at<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> top<00:00:43.649> or

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's not anywhere else at the top or

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.709 
it's not anywhere else at the top or
bottom<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> close<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
bottom so we're going to close this and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
bottom so we're going to close this and
we're<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> leave<00:00:46.110> our<00:00:46.140> $80<00:00:46.680> open

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
we're going to leave our $80 open

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
we're going to leave our $80 open
because<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.460> need<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.539> sec

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
because we will need it in just a sec
