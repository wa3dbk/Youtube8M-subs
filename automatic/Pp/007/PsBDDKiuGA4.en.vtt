00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.900
 You play against Barcelona under 19. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.400
 They are very impressed with what they have seen so far. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400
 They will therefore focus their players on the game. 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 They will not underestimate us. 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 Today we have to play a strong game, 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
 every player must perform. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
 Keep playing concentrated 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.900
 and show what we have learned. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Don't give him space! Put pressure! 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.500
 Well done. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 Go ahead, go ahead! 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 Good, good! 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.500
 Unfortunately. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 Come on, go for it. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 That should not happen Abou, much too easily. 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.800
 Good Sean, good. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 Penalty. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.900
 As a spectator, this competition looks like a chess game. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 They may have more possession, but they cannot create opportunities because our organization is good. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.900
 Stay focused. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 It is mentally and physically tiring but keep going on. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.900
 Abou, you can do much better. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 You are a determining player, show that you are present. We need such a player. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 You now know that you can beat them. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.500
 We already knew. And hopefully some of you too. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900
 You only now realize that this is possible. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.900
 Now you must continue and lock the game. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.000
 Well done Abou! 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
 Well .. you have time Abou. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Stay calm now. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Now we! 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.000
 OK, go ahead! Well done! 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.000
 Find your husband. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.900
 We have achieved good results lately. Today stood out because you knew 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.900
 when to put pressure, when to attack and to keep tactics in mind. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 The first half I did not play well 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.900
 Edu pointed that out to me 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.900
 but I already knew. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.400
 In the peace and quiet I resumed myself 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
 and we went full for the profit. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 The best way to develop as a player 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.900
 is to play against top opponents. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.100
 But we dealt with it very well. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.900
 This entire journey has been a learning moment for our players. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.900
 To find out everything about Barcelona here: 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.900
 their philosophy, their method, how they develop their players, how they work together as a team. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.000
 This competition is an expression of everything they have learned 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.000
 and nothing makes a team stronger than a successful competition.
