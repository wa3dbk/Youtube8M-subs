00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 good time warriors contract wars 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 with you forkman and today I will review 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.310
 on a large-caliber sniper rifle 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.830
 and a navy with excellent martial 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.279
 characteristics but costly in 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 repair plan for the first time taking a navy in hand 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 I realized that this is my dream I have long wanted 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.840
 such a barrel tags and uboiny silent 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.350
 light and quick exhaust by 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 versus a navy plastic toy in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 That day I for the first time with a navy killed 40 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.239
 man with one patron and was like that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 This someone believed 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 dream and that's enough when I took fm. I 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.329
 also gave up on children 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 are disappointed to know that Santa Claus 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 there are no characteristics of which 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.899
 you can achieve ya and navy accuracy then oh 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.449
 this accuracy is the first 15 20 rounds 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.049
 accuracy is normal and then and then she 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.200
 starts to shoot very crookedly or am I 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.360
 slaughter 174 in theory with such a slaughter 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.570
 you should kill one shot but 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.820
 here and there is not always sometimes need 2 and 3 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 cartridge probably tank if the opponent 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.740
 moves it just doesn't die though 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.259
 blood splat go fire rate one 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.140
 here also found minutes after the shot 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.430
 the zoom doesnâ€™t always go off ozum 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.979
 it remains to wait 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.000
 a split second only then turns off 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.530
 sound mobility 67 you run slow and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.150
 no mobility 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.869
 for this snipe u need separately 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.000
 pumped under mobility recharge 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.220
 62 very long though before the recharge deal 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 rarely came more often killed after 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.909
 first slip your stock 11 stores 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.420
 again cartridges on the broken and you need them 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.479
 only 30 40 rounds then she curve 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.520
 cartridges. 338 lapua magnum in a review about 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.830
 dt srs I talked about them 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 penetrability fifty fifty on 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.009
 fifty firing range of 425 meters 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.180
 at this distance, the slaughter rate drops to 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.489
 75 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.500
 if we consider that a little navy 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.630
 broke then from one end of the card to 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.010
 another valnut almost impossible 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.780
 the price of these weapons is 290 thousand credits 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.090
 plus everything to this value 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.550
 500 thousand credits added 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.060
 which are going to be fulfilled in longing 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.100
 do not break in on a Navy worth 600 g n 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.830
 the only correct decision that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.860
 allow normality not to play it ck 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.489
 500 long shot of about 6 8 hours 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.250
 playing time costing anguish 350 g 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.090
 n is in demand and there is no need to buy it 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.850
 repair price for one unit three thousand 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.260
 800 credits is about 15 shots 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.190
 a bit of math 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 253 credits per shot 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.739
 playing with x3 may be beneficial but for the time being I 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.049
 rocked remained in the minus for some reason 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.140
 Apparently you need to get used to it 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.090
 bring down one cartridge and one hundred percent 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.609
 it should not break to after all 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.609
 normal snipe average per round 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.010
 a minimum of 40 frags is 50 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.750
 rounds the minimum the time and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.400
 navy will be a curve 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.019
 unless of course she does not break and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.930
 modifications for you task 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.570
 you get a collimator their silencer by 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.079
 essentially it turned out such a shot only without 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.540
 fractions 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.900
 it's like saiga 1 patron and only more accurate 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.329
 here she is flying 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.620
 these are his lovers poyazat bug with 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.319
 lucky clearance less wall with navy not 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.129
 I see through the average frame of the navy in my 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.560
 from 0 90 to 1 and 8 with normal players 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.489
 it will be very difficult to play with a navy 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.099
 let's summarize why i bought this sniper 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.079
 just for fun as the main weapon 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.409
 in my opinion it is better not to use it 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.950
 but then the nuance if you bend down with it 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.379
 as if you are a true pro 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.879
 When on the map they play big fished and from 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:14.889
 65 and you go to the storm while navy feeling 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.359
 similar to those as if you were doing 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.269
 the prophets 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.549
 buy or not buy if no extra 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.419
 eight hundred seventy mowers loans then 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.599
 and I need you extra expenses also for 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.590
 the same 600dp can take two do not break 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.669
 svs 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.800
 or s voice adding 50 g p or the same dt 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.050
 srs which will drag very much 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:49.990
 although of course this is how to compare BMW 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:53.550
 mercedes each with his own color and taste 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.419
 you were the form put huskies and 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.820
 subscribe to the channel 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.139
 just under the video has my group and vk 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.330
 link to the game 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.330
 I wish you all the best 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 but
