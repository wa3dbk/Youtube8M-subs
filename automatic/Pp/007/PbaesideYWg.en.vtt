00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.620
 December 12, 1999 cataclysmic vision on this busy intersection but 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.009
 What happened 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.410
 I see Columbus at the gates of Paris this peaceful and uneventful 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 claude mico knows him by heart since he lives since always 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.740
 wish to contemplate the daily tram-train of a quiet little town 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.460
 he is awakened by strange noises 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.349
 this was going on outside which each time brings the agent on the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.080
 building that was in front of France 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.390
 in the hair 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.980
 really satisfied with the huge wind it made a noise infernal his paintings 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.880

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.640
 the building 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 a five-storey building covered over more than 400 square meters 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.830
 given the magnitude of the structure the least potential price defaults 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.190
 dramatic consequences 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.400
 seeing this show I told myself 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.320

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 his friend franÃ§ois hollande 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.530

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.450
 security 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.990
 but it would be faster because the wind is always more intense scaffolding 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 possible 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.740
 but he fell into a deafening crash 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.790

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.560
