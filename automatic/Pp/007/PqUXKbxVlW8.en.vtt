let's<00:03:30.480> go<00:03:30.629> ahead<00:03:30.719> and<00:03:30.900> take<00:03:31.019> our<00:03:31.170> highlighter

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
let's go ahead and take our highlighter

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
let's go ahead and take our highlighter
and<00:03:31.920> highlight<00:03:31.980> some<00:03:32.310> key<00:03:32.519> words<00:03:32.909> here<00:03:33.120> we're

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and highlight some key words here we're

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.670 
and highlight some key words here we're
talking<00:03:34.079> about<00:03:34.700> humans<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.680> environment

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
talking about humans to environment

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.709 
talking about humans to environment
that's<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.250> HTE<00:03:38.879> part<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:41.269> then<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.420> we<00:03:42.569> were

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:42.719 
that's the HTE part and then if we were

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.869 
that's the HTE part and then if we were
to<00:03:42.780> flip<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.260> around<00:03:43.349> II<00:03:45.890> with<00:03:46.890> an<00:03:47.069> arrow<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.489> an

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
to flip it around II with an arrow to an

to flip it around II with an arrow to an
H<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.599> like<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.079> call<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.290> e<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.620> H<00:03:49.890> what<00:03:50.310> we're

H I like to call it e to H what we're

00:03:50.519 --> 00:04:05.770 
H I like to call it e to H what we're
looking<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:50.909> there<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:58.459> what<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.670> environment

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.379 

does<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.079> humans<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.889> once<00:04:08.609> again<00:04:08.760> using<00:04:09.150> your

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.069 
environment to humans that's the e2h
part<00:04:18.500> now<00:04:19.500> humans<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.639> environment

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
part now humans and the environment

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.990 
part now humans and the environment
either<00:04:22.079> help<00:04:22.770> or<00:04:22.979> hurt<00:04:23.130> each<00:04:23.310> other<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.639> when

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
either help or hurt each other so when

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.760 
either help or hurt each other so when
they<00:04:24.090> help<00:04:24.300> each<00:04:24.419> other<00:04:24.630> that's<00:04:25.229> actually<00:04:25.740> a

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
they help each other that's actually a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.370 
they help each other that's actually a
positive<00:04:26.039> thing<00:04:26.539> some<00:04:27.539> left<00:04:27.750> hand<00:04:27.990> side<00:04:28.259> go

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
positive thing some left hand side go

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.710 
positive thing some left hand side go
ahead<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.740> draw<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:29.250> positive<00:04:30.210> sign<00:04:30.419> I'm<00:04:30.630> going

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
ahead and draw a positive sign I'm going

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.499 
ahead and draw a positive sign I'm going
to<00:04:30.840> put<00:04:30.990> parentheses<00:04:31.139> around<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.509> what

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
to put parentheses around it and what

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:47.770 
to put parentheses around it and what
that<00:04:33.720> means<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:36.710> positive<00:04:39.349> or<00:04:40.760> helpful

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:56.020 

affects<00:04:49.480> or<00:04:51.190> impact<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:55.160> let's<00:04:55.370> go<00:04:55.520> ahead<00:04:55.730> and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
affects or impact so let's go ahead and

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:05.050 
affects or impact so let's go ahead and
highlight<00:04:56.950> positive<00:04:57.950> impact<00:04:58.790> and<00:05:03.820> then<00:05:04.820> let's

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
highlight positive impact and then let's

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.140 
highlight positive impact and then let's
go<00:05:05.210> ahead<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.540> take<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:06.460> exact<00:05:07.460> opposite

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
go ahead and take the exact opposite

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.500 
go ahead and take the exact opposite
which<00:05:08.900> is<00:05:09.160> negative<00:05:12.940> so<00:05:13.940> when<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.240> see<00:05:14.389> the

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
which is negative so when you see the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.870 
which is negative so when you see the
negative<00:05:14.990> sign<00:05:15.230> with<00:05:15.440> H<00:05:15.650> -<00:05:15.830> E<00:05:15.860> or<00:05:16.160> e<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.430> H<00:05:16.610> it

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
negative sign with H - E or e to H it

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:29.430 
negative sign with H - E or e to H it
means<00:05:17.090> negative<00:05:21.220> or<00:05:22.240> harmful<00:05:23.240> effects<00:05:27.850> or

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
means negative or harmful effects or

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.610 
means negative or harmful effects or
impact<00:05:31.300> right<00:05:32.300> grab<00:05:32.630> your<00:05:32.660> highlighter<00:05:33.230> again

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
impact right grab your highlighter again

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.500 
impact right grab your highlighter again
so<00:05:34.190> what<00:05:34.340> we're<00:05:34.490> looking<00:05:34.520> at<00:05:34.910> here<00:05:35.180> is<00:05:35.390> a

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
so what we're looking at here is a

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.900 
so what we're looking at here is a
negative<00:05:35.870> impact<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:39.280> now<00:05:40.280> what<00:05:40.520> we're<00:05:40.669> going

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
negative impact and now what we're going

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.469 
negative impact and now what we're going
to<00:05:41.000> do<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.720> I'm<00:05:42.169> going<00:05:42.200> to<00:05:42.560> have<00:05:42.770> you

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
to do is I'm going to have you

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.020 
to do is I'm going to have you
brainstorm<00:05:44.710> some<00:05:45.710> positive<00:05:46.430> or<00:05:46.610> negative

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
brainstorm some positive or negative

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.710 
brainstorm some positive or negative
effects<00:05:47.900> for<00:05:48.320> H<00:05:48.620> -<00:05:48.860> E<00:05:48.889> and<00:05:49.340> E<00:05:49.610> 2<00:05:49.669> H<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.600> on<00:05:50.660> the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
effects for H - E and E 2 H so on the

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.240 
effects for H - E and E 2 H so on the
left<00:05:50.900> hand<00:05:51.080> side<00:05:51.380> let's<00:05:51.530> go<00:05:51.650> ahead<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.040> write

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
left hand side let's go ahead and write

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.600 
left hand side let's go ahead and write
e<00:05:52.600> X<00:05:53.600> for<00:05:53.930> example<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:57.070> then<00:05:58.070> let's<00:05:58.310> go<00:05:58.490> ahead

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
e X for example and then let's go ahead

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.400 
e X for example and then let's go ahead
and<00:05:58.940> write<00:05:59.090> on<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.419> left<00:05:59.600> hand<00:05:59.840> side<00:06:00.460> H<00:06:01.460> 2<00:06:01.910> e

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
and write on the left hand side H 2 e

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.350 
and write on the left hand side H 2 e
positive<00:06:03.410> so<00:06:04.130> what<00:06:04.460> we're<00:06:04.610> looking<00:06:04.640> at<00:06:05.060> here
