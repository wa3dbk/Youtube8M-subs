and<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:24.570> second<00:00:25.050> job<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.529> we're<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and the second job thing we're going to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.330 
and the second job thing we're going to
learn<00:00:26.099> from<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.430> lesson<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:28.010> when<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.160> have

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
learn from this lesson is when you have

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.510 
learn from this lesson is when you have
a<00:00:29.369> sudden<00:00:29.820> problem<00:00:30.830> take<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:32.130> bit<00:00:32.279> more

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
a sudden problem take a little bit more

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
a sudden problem take a little bit more
time<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> try<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.809> figure<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.469> before

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
time to try and figure it out before

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.970 
time to try and figure it out before
going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.930> extremes<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> buying<00:00:37.710> new

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
going to the extremes of buying new

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.910 
going to the extremes of buying new
equipment<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:39.480> recent<00:00:39.899> video<00:00:40.620> card

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
equipment like my recent video card

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
equipment like my recent video card
purchase<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.140> started<00:00:43.890> having<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.309> video

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
purchase so I started having this video

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
purchase so I started having this video
card<00:00:45.510> problem<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> processor<00:00:46.920> problem

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
card problem and processor problem

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
card problem and processor problem
whereas<00:00:47.910> not<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:48.539> temperatures<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.230> my

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
whereas not that my temperatures on my

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.920 
whereas not that my temperatures on my
video<00:00:49.590> card<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:50.010> spike<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.930> CPU

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
video card would spike and CPU

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.369 
video card would spike and CPU
temperatures<00:00:52.440> would<00:00:52.590> spike<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.570> got

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
temperatures would spike and so I got

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.080 
temperatures would spike and so I got
frustrated<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.160> couldn't<00:00:56.579> fix<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
frustrated with I couldn't fix it so I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.549 
frustrated with I couldn't fix it so I
said<00:00:57.329> well<00:00:57.420> let<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.629> buy<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> new<00:00:58.020> video<00:00:58.199> card

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
said well let me buy a new video card

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
said well let me buy a new video card
maybe<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
maybe that's it and I got it and now to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
maybe that's it and I got it and now to
be<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.649> cars<00:01:01.829> running<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.340> lower<00:01:02.520> but

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
be there cars running a lot lower but

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.109 
be there cars running a lot lower but
I'm<00:01:03.180> still<00:01:03.420> seeing<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> spike<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:05.119> intermittent

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I'm still seeing a spike in intermittent

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.660 
I'm still seeing a spike in intermittent
spike<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.750> GPU<00:01:07.290> temperatures<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.250> CPU

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
spike in my GPU temperatures and my CPU

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960 
spike in my GPU temperatures and my CPU
like<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.590> 45<00:01:10.590> Celsius<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
like right now 45 Celsius and this is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.910 
like right now 45 Celsius and this is
running<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:12.750> too<00:01:13.170> high<00:01:13.320> 60s

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
running up just a little too high 60s

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.200 
running up just a little too high 60s
and<00:01:14.340> 70s<00:01:16.070> now<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.640> saw<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> program

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and 70s now so I got this saw a program

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.429 
and 70s now so I got this saw a program
called<00:01:18.479> gpu-z

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
called gpu-z

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
called gpu-z
and<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.460> allows<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> monitor<00:01:21.119> what's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and it allows you to monitor what's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
and it allows you to monitor what's
going<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.680> graphics<00:01:23.040> card<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
going on with your graphics card and you

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
going on with your graphics card and you
see<00:01:24.090> these<00:01:24.240> big<00:01:24.540> red<00:01:25.020> blocks<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.770> this

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
see these big red blocks here in this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.630 
see these big red blocks here in this

column just GPUs load right now it's at

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.660 
column just GPUs load right now it's at
zero<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> black<00:01:31.140> area<00:01:31.670> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

every<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> start<00:01:33.570> seeing<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.930> red<00:01:34.229> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
every time you start seeing this red it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.630 
every time you start seeing this red it
goes<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.630> 97<00:01:36.630> 98<00:01:36.930> percent<00:01:37.439> GPE<00:01:37.829> loads<00:01:38.280> and

goes up to 97 98 percent GPE loads and
since<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.750> doing<00:01:39.810> anything<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.650> the

there's<00:01:41.759> no<00:01:41.970> reason<00:01:42.450> why<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:43.380> GPU<00:01:43.829> load<00:01:44.159> should

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
there's no reason why my GPU load should

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.240 
there's no reason why my GPU load should
be<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.820> 97<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> 98<00:01:45.840> percent<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.950> we'll<00:01:47.130> just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
be at 97 to 98 percent so we'll just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
be at 97 to 98 percent so we'll just
wait<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> minute<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> until<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> uh<00:01:48.479> tries<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
wait a minute and until it uh tries it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.190 
wait a minute and until it uh tries it
again<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:52.399> 97<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:53.939> 97<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:54.810> back<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
again that 97 here we go 97 I'm back to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.209 
again that 97 here we go 97 I'm back to
zero<00:01:57.170> see<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.530> short<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:58.920> bot

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
zero see that little short little bot

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.809 
you know there's a core stuff body right
rise<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> temperature<00:02:10.709> every<00:02:11.489> time<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
rise in the temperature every time that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.480 
rise in the temperature every time that
happens

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
happens

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.220 
happens
the<00:02:13.000> GPU<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.840> 234<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.890> 64<00:02:15.460> as<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.900> CPU

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the GPU is 234 now and 64 as for the CPU

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.230 
the GPU is 234 now and 64 as for the CPU
but<00:02:17.590> those<00:02:18.130> will<00:02:18.310> jump<00:02:18.580> as<00:02:18.760> soon<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.180> of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
but those will jump as soon as one of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.360 
but those will jump as soon as one of
those<00:02:19.450> little<00:02:19.720> spikes<00:02:20.440> come<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.370> realized

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
those little spikes come so I realized

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.390 
those little spikes come so I realized
immediately<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:25.180> somehow<00:02:26.080> my<00:02:26.530> GPU<00:02:27.040> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
immediately there somehow my GPU is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.680 
immediately there somehow my GPU is
being<00:02:27.640> hijacked<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:29.170> only<00:02:29.500> thing<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.860> know

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
being hijacked and the only thing I know

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.190 
being hijacked and the only thing I know
where<00:02:31.690> your<00:02:31.840> GPU<00:02:32.290> gets<00:02:32.680> hijacked<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.820> a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
where your GPU gets hijacked is a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.710 
where your GPU gets hijacked is a
Bitcoin<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:36.310> recently<00:02:36.610> well<00:02:37.450> here<00:02:37.600> we<00:02:37.690> go

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
Bitcoin and I recently well here we go

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.880 
Bitcoin and I recently well here we go
there<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.250> spike<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.270> recently

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
there it is the spike so I recently

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.550 
there it is the spike so I recently
downloaded<00:02:44.890> install<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.550> Bitcoin<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.410> it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
downloaded install a Bitcoin but then it

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
downloaded install a Bitcoin but then it
took<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.040> much<00:02:48.100> my<00:02:48.430> space<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.630> my<00:02:49.660> hard

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
took up so much my space on my hard

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.590 
took up so much my space on my hard
drive<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.640> decided<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.120> get<00:02:52.180> rid<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.540> I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
drive that I decided to get rid of it I

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.560 
drive that I decided to get rid of it I
deleted<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:54.670> ever<00:02:54.850> since<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:55.360> I've<00:02:55.540> had

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
deleted it but ever since then I've had

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.810 
deleted it but ever since then I've had
this<00:02:55.900> problem<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:57.070> didn't<00:02:57.340> connect<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
this problem and I didn't connect it

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820 
this problem and I didn't connect it
right<00:02:57.970> away<00:02:58.090> but<00:02:59.080> here's<00:02:59.350> how<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.560> could

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
right away but here's how you could

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.570 
right away but here's how you could
figure<00:03:00.220> things<00:03:00.550> out<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:02.530> make<00:03:02.770> sure<00:03:02.800> you're

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
figure things out now make sure you're

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.980 
figure things out now make sure you're
not<00:03:03.670> running<00:03:03.910> anything<00:03:04.330> using<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> Internet

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
not running anything using the Internet

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.240 
not running anything using the Internet
other<00:03:07.990> than<00:03:08.230> passages<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.100> is

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
other than passages like this is

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.300 
other than passages like this is
passively<00:03:09.610> monitoring<00:03:10.210> stuff<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:11.530> um<00:03:11.740> and

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
passively monitoring stuff but um and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.940 
passively monitoring stuff but um and
you<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.630> use<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> little<00:03:14.110> program<00:03:14.620> that's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
you go you use a little program that's

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.140 
you go you use a little program that's
already<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.250> your<00:03:15.370> hard<00:03:15.640> drive<00:03:15.760> called

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
already on your hard drive called

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.840 
already on your hard drive called
netstat<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.100> command<00:03:18.490> right

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
netstat and this is the command right

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.820 
netstat and this is the command right
here<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.870> was<00:03:20.020> face<00:03:20.200> -<00:03:20.500> being

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
here and that's that it was face - being

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.280 
here and that's that it was face - being
a<00:03:20.860> little<00:03:21.100> up<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.330> could<00:03:22.480> read<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.870> I'm<00:03:23.050> sure

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
a little up you could read that I'm sure

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.250 
a little up you could read that I'm sure
I'm<00:03:23.620> gonna<00:03:24.100> copy<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.810> what<00:03:28.960> this<00:03:29.080> does

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
I'm gonna copy that and what this does

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.320 
I'm gonna copy that and what this does
it<00:03:29.410> tells<00:03:29.620> us<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.740> run<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.100> stat<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.700> where

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
it tells us to run that stat and where

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.050 
it tells us to run that stat and where
