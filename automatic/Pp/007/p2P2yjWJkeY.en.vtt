maybe do another video so watch part 2

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:05.819 
maybe do another video so watch part 2
to<00:06:02.109> see<00:06:02.409> how<00:06:02.769> I<00:06:02.829> apply<00:06:03.249> the<00:06:03.909> color<00:06:04.829> afterward

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:05.829 
to see how I apply the color afterward

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
to see how I apply the color afterward
CN<00:06:06.519> so<00:06:06.759> this'll<00:06:07.089> be<00:06:07.119> mixing<00:06:08.399> so<00:06:09.399> you<00:06:09.699> can

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
CN so this'll be mixing so you can

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.909 
CN so this'll be mixing so you can
always<00:06:10.029> mix<00:06:10.419> colors<00:06:10.899> it's<00:06:11.169> best<00:06:11.439> those<00:06:11.739> two

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
always mix colors it's best those two

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.409 
always mix colors it's best those two
get<00:06:12.099> colors<00:06:12.489> of<00:06:12.669> the<00:06:12.879> same<00:06:13.149> base<00:06:13.539> um<00:06:15.419> because

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
get colors of the same base um because

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.119 
get colors of the same base um because
you<00:06:16.569> might<00:06:16.779> distort<00:06:17.379> the<00:06:17.559> color

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
you might distort the color

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.939 
you might distort the color
so<00:06:18.519> don't<00:06:18.729> get<00:06:19.059> like<00:06:19.269> a<00:06:19.509> color<00:06:19.869> that<00:06:20.259> has<00:06:20.649> a

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
so don't get like a color that has a

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:26.729 
so don't get like a color that has a
