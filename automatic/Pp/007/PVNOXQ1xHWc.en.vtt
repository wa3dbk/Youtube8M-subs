department or do you test them every

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.750 
department or do you test them every

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.370 
engine that gets assembled here at S&amp;S
goes<00:01:13.030> through<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> testing<00:01:13.720> department<00:01:14.290> which

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
goes through a testing department which

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.080 
goes through a testing department which
will<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.800> know<00:01:14.830> will<00:01:15.070> go<00:01:15.160> into<00:01:15.340> with<00:01:15.610> it<00:01:15.730> every

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
will you know will go into with it every

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.430 
will you know will go into with it every
engines<00:01:16.360> assembled<00:01:16.810> there's<00:01:17.350> a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
engines assembled there's a

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.380 
engines assembled there's a
specification<00:01:18.010> sheet<00:01:18.460> done<00:01:18.640> on<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.120> then

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
specification sheet done on it and then

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.840 
specification sheet done on it and then
there's<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.660> test<00:01:20.110> which<00:01:20.490> once<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.610> engine

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
there's a test which once the engine

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.120 
there's a test which once the engine
passes<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.330> test<00:01:22.390> then<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.260> boxed<00:01:23.950> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
passes that test then it is boxed and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.830 
passes that test then it is boxed and
shipped<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> customer<00:01:24.880> pretty<00:01:25.600> cool

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
shipped to the customer pretty cool

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
shipped to the customer pretty cool
let's<00:01:26.230> go<00:01:26.350> check<00:01:26.590> out<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.890> engine<00:01:27.040> testing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.760 

okay<00:01:30.820> Travis<00:01:31.120> we<00:01:31.630> follow<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.170> motor<00:01:32.440> from

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
okay Travis we follow this motor from

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.830 
okay Travis we follow this motor from
the<00:01:32.890> assembly<00:01:33.400> bench<00:01:33.670> back<00:01:34.270> here<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.750> where

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
the assembly bench back here to where

the assembly bench back here to where
you're<00:01:34.990> going<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.200> run<00:01:35.230> it<00:01:35.440> up<00:01:35.590> tell<00:01:35.830> me<00:01:35.950> about

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
you're going to run it up tell me about

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.280 
you're going to run it up tell me about
the<00:01:36.220> process<00:01:36.430> well<00:01:37.300> once<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.870> engine<00:01:38.140> comes

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
the process well once the engine comes

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.030 
the process well once the engine comes
off<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.590> centerline

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.770 
off the centerline
as<00:01:39.190> its<00:01:39.370> assembled<00:01:39.760> there's<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.030> inspection

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
as its assembled there's a inspection

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.940 
as its assembled there's a inspection

our<00:01:53.080> test<00:01:53.410> cycle<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.920> each<00:01:54.310> SS<00:01:54.880> engine<00:01:55.270> once<00:01:55.840> it

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
our test cycle on each SS engine once it

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.050 
our test cycle on each SS engine once it
passes<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.530> test<00:01:56.740> then<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.550> taken<00:01:57.820> out<00:01:57.910> the
