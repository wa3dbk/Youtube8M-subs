most<00:02:56.520> Miyazaki<00:02:57.120> projects<00:02:57.600> that's<00:02:57.780> part<00:02:58.050> of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
most Miyazaki projects that's part of

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.170 
most Miyazaki projects that's part of
the<00:02:58.260> charm<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.770> here<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.340> just<00:02:59.550> doesn't<00:02:59.670> seem

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the charm but here it just doesn't seem

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.150 
the charm but here it just doesn't seem
to<00:03:00.210> affect<00:03:00.450> anything<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.710> could<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.040> as

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
to affect anything you could just as

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.310 
to affect anything you could just as
easily<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.520> him<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> normal<00:03:03.720> pilot<00:03:04.170> with

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
easily have him be a normal pilot with

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.380 
easily have him be a normal pilot with
just<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.830> star<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.430> his<00:03:05.580> hand<00:03:05.880> or<00:03:06.060> something

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
just a star on his hand or something

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.960 
just a star on his hand or something
like<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.690> Princess<00:03:07.020> Mononoke<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:08.340> only<00:03:08.760> thing

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
like in Princess Mononoke the only thing

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.910 
like in Princess Mononoke the only thing
I<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.240> figure<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.720> maybe<00:03:09.990> they<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.410> wanted<00:03:10.800> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
I can figure is maybe they just wanted a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.590 
I can figure is maybe they just wanted a
little<00:03:11.130> bit<00:03:11.340> more<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.610> an<00:03:11.700> identity<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
little bit more of an identity for the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380 
little bit more of an identity for the
film<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.200> visual<00:03:13.680> identity<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.239> can

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
film like a visual identity like you can

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.270 
film like a visual identity like you can
look<00:03:15.540> at<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> poster<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.590> pig<00:03:16.950> fly

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
look at the poster and be like a pig fly

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.360 
look at the poster and be like a pig fly
wha<00:03:17.850> I'll<00:03:18.510> believe<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:18.989> when<00:03:19.260> pigs<00:03:19.709> fly<00:03:19.890> oh

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
wha I'll believe that when pigs fly oh

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.940 
wha I'll believe that when pigs fly oh
wait<00:03:20.640> yeah<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.239> guess<00:03:21.540> that's<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.989> joke<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:22.770> it

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
wait yeah I guess that's the joke but it

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.680 
wait yeah I guess that's the joke but it
just<00:03:23.220> kind<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.520> seems<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.940> middle<00:03:24.480> that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
just kind of seems like a middle that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.760 
just kind of seems like a middle that
doesn't<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> whole<00:03:25.500> bunch<00:03:25.680> of

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
doesn't have a whole bunch of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.800 
doesn't have a whole bunch of
possibilities<00:03:26.180> either<00:03:27.180> making<00:03:27.480> something

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
possibilities either making something

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.110 
possibilities either making something
really<00:03:27.959> grand<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:28.830> crazy<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.520> have<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:30.000> he's

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
really grand or crazy or have what he's

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.970 
really grand or crazy or have what he's
cursed<00:03:30.420> with<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:30.959> something<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.500> subtle

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
cursed with just something very subtle

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.160 
cursed with just something very subtle
but<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.610> said<00:03:32.790> before<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.150> by<00:03:33.480> no<00:03:33.540> means

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
but like I said before that by no means

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.260 
but like I said before that by no means
makes<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.830> bad<00:03:35.070> movie<00:03:35.610> for<00:03:36.090> all<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
makes it a bad movie for all the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.330 
makes it a bad movie for all the
dogfights<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.959> machine<00:03:37.290> gunfire<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.100> it's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
dogfights a machine gunfire in this it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.000 
dogfights a machine gunfire in this it's
actually<00:03:39.000> very<00:03:39.270> very<00:03:39.420> relaxed<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:40.920> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
actually very very relaxed it's just the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650 
actually very very relaxed it's just the
characters<00:03:41.400> being<00:03:41.640> really<00:03:41.880> charming<00:03:42.450> and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
characters being really charming and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420 
characters being really charming and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.520 
working off each other having pleasant
conversations<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.600> writings<00:03:45.989> decent<00:03:46.440> D

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
acting's decent it's all good I just

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.949 
acting's decent it's all good I just
don't<00:03:49.620> get<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.070> main<00:03:50.310> creative<00:03:50.790> choice<00:03:51.060> but

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
don't get the main creative choice but

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.810 
don't get the main creative choice but
maybe<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.590> don't<00:03:52.680> need<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.190> because<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.610> film

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
maybe I don't need to because the film

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820 
maybe I don't need to because the film
is<00:03:53.970> still<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> lot<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.450> fun<00:03:54.690> regardless<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.500> don't

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
is still a lot of fun regardless I don't

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.280 
is still a lot of fun regardless I don't
think<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.430> quite<00:03:56.970> as<00:03:57.300> much<00:03:57.570> as<00:03:57.810> Kiki

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
think I like it quite as much as Kiki

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.170 
think I like it quite as much as Kiki
because<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.190> said<00:03:59.250> they<00:03:59.550> do<00:03:59.610> take<00:03:59.940> more

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
because like I said they do take more

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.150 
because like I said they do take more
advantage<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.930> idea<00:04:01.170> what's<00:04:01.980> still

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
