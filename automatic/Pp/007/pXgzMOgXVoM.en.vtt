00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that complicated picking all the time

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
that complicated picking all the time
you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.190> just<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> simple<00:01:32.700> strum<00:01:33.090> pattern

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you can just do a simple strum pattern

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.780 
you can just do a simple strum pattern
and<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.410> really<00:01:34.620> like<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.800> triplet<00:01:35.160> feel<00:01:35.550> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and it's really like a triplet feel so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.180 
and it's really like a triplet feel so
it's<00:01:35.940> like<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> count<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.870> one

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
it's like you can count it as one

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.750 
it's like you can count it as one
triple-t<00:01:38.190> one<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:43.230> that's<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.340> full<00:01:44.580> bar

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760

triple-t one so and that's a full bar
okay<00:01:45.120> so<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> C

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.920 

now<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.320> third<00:01:52.710> bar<00:01:53.630> you're<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.810> do

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
now the third bar you're going to do

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.290 
now the third bar you're going to do
half<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.440> bar<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.760> half<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:57.000> bar<00:01:57.150> this

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
half a bar of this and a half a bar this

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.570 
half a bar of this and a half a bar this
and<00:01:58.260> then<00:01:59.160> it's<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.430> ass<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:02.130> first<00:02:02.400> four

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.590 

in<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.940> children

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.679

notice when I got to the g7 there which
by<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> way<00:03:10.989> was<00:03:11.200> shaped<00:03:11.409> like<00:03:11.560> this

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
by the way was shaped like this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.240 
by the way was shaped like this

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280
