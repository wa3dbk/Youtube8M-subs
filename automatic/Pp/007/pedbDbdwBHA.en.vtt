comfortable<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.800> all<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.980> us<00:02:30.070> I'm<00:02:30.520> going<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
comfortable for all of us I'm going to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.000 
comfortable for all of us I'm going to
separate<00:02:30.970> my<00:02:31.030> hair<00:02:31.270> into<00:02:31.720> two<00:02:32.320> pieces<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
separate my hair into two pieces and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.470 
separate my hair into two pieces and
we've<00:02:33.130> got<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.700> our<00:02:33.850> bottom<00:02:34.360> layer

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
we've got this is our bottom layer

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.510 
we've got this is our bottom layer
obviously<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:35.230> trick<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:35.830> curling<00:02:36.160> our<00:02:36.280> hair

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
obviously a trick with curling our hair

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.090 
obviously a trick with curling our hair
with<00:02:36.700> your<00:02:37.000> flat<00:02:37.420> iron<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.959> lot<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.800> people<00:02:39.010> are

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
with your flat iron a lot of people are

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.530 
with your flat iron a lot of people are
inclined<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:40.000> way<00:02:40.209> because<00:02:40.510> that

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
inclined to do it this way because that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.890 
inclined to do it this way because that
feels<00:02:40.990> more<00:02:41.260> natural<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:42.480> let<00:02:43.480> me<00:02:43.570> tell<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
feels more natural but let me tell you

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.360 
feels more natural but let me tell you
it<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.320> better<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.580> do<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:47.410> way<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:48.220> this

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it is better to do it this way so this

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.710 
it is better to do it this way so this
is<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.610> motion<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.910> we're<00:02:49.120> going<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.540> be

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
is the motion that we're going to be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.400 
is the motion that we're going to be
using<00:02:50.320> holding<00:02:51.130> our<00:02:51.220> arm<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.940> this

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
using holding our arm up like this

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.800 
using holding our arm up like this
cleaning<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.500> hair<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.010> then<00:02:54.430> twisting<00:02:55.330> it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
cleaning the hair and then twisting it

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.170 
cleaning the hair and then twisting it
through<00:02:56.200> I'm<00:02:56.650> going<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.860> clip<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.490> hair<00:02:57.910> out

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
through I'm going to clip this hair out

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.770 
through I'm going to clip this hair out
of<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.540> way<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.550> then<00:03:03.730> work<00:03:03.940> with<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.330> piece

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
of the way and then work with this piece

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.750 
of the way and then work with this piece
we're<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.680> grab<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.100> hair<00:03:06.130> as<00:03:06.400> close<00:03:06.640> to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
we're going to grab the hair as close to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.699 
we're going to grab the hair as close to
the<00:03:06.850> base<00:03:07.030> as<00:03:07.269> we<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.750> while<00:03:08.050> moving<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
the base as we can while moving it a

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.490 
the base as we can while moving it a
little<00:03:08.920> bit<00:03:09.130> twist

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
little bit twist

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.050 
little bit twist
get<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.650> hair<00:03:11.800> like<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.610> slower<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.030> go

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
get the hair like that the slower you go

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.330 
get the hair like that the slower you go
the<00:03:13.239> tighter<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.870> curl<00:03:13.900> will<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.250> you

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the tighter the curl will be and you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.410 
the tighter the curl will be and you
want<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.580> make<00:03:15.700> sure<00:03:15.820> you've<00:03:15.970> got<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.150> clamped

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
want to make sure you've got it clamped

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.059 
want to make sure you've got it clamped
all<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.989> way<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.410> very<00:03:17.590> ends<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.160> that

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.449 

there<00:03:23.030> we<00:03:23.209> go<00:03:23.390> we've<00:03:23.629> got<00:03:23.659> one<00:03:24.249> so<00:03:25.249> I'm<00:03:25.340> doing

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
there we go we've got one so I'm doing

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.030 
there we go we've got one so I'm doing
kind<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.909> looser<00:03:26.420> curls<00:03:27.170> right<00:03:27.409> now<00:03:27.560> let's

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
kind of looser curls right now let's

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:38.070 
kind of looser curls right now let's
take<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> look<00:03:28.579> at<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.849> little<00:03:29.269> bit<00:03:29.599> closer

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.790 

I'm<00:03:38.980> gonna<00:03:39.160> throw<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.460> one<00:03:39.730> behind<00:03:40.030> me<00:03:40.800> split

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
I'm gonna throw that one behind me split

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.070 
I'm gonna throw that one behind me split
this<00:03:41.830> into<00:03:42.220> one<00:03:42.400> two<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:42.970> sections<00:03:43.300> you<00:03:43.930> want

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
this into one two more sections you want

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
said as close to the base as possible

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.050 
said as close to the base as possible
so<00:03:57.940> we<00:03:58.030> do<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> little<00:03:58.330> grab<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:59.340> flip<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.850> want<00:04:01.000> to

the<00:05:45.509> same<00:05:45.750> way<00:05:46.020> but<00:05:46.560> instead<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:47.099> just<00:05:47.220> going

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
the same way but instead of just going

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.129

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.920 

so<00:06:05.460> holding<00:06:05.879> the<00:06:05.939> one<00:06:06.090> like<00:06:06.210> this<00:06:06.389> gives<00:06:06.750> you

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930
