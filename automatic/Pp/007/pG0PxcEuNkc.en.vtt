when we first listen to them of course
we<00:00:22.650> started<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> 10<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> fabulous

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
we started with the 10 it was a fabulous

we started with the 10 it was a fabulous
column<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> 10<00:00:25.140> price<00:00:25.859> point<00:00:26.189> was

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
column for a 10 price point was

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.700 
column for a 10 price point was
incredible<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.570> even<00:00:27.869> today<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.140> feel<00:00:28.470> that

this could be a 2 speaker system could
be<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> guy<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> check<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.550> CPX

10a<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.860> difference<00:00:38.190> between<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> two

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
10a now the difference between the two

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.770 
10a now the difference between the two
is<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:38.910> talking<00:00:39.210> about<00:00:39.300> twice<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is we're talking about twice the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
is we're talking about twice the
amplifier<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.410> 15<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> 12<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> 15<00:00:41.700> jump

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
amplifier in the 15 to 12 and a 15 jump

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.030 
amplifier in the 15 to 12 and a 15 jump
to<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> 500<00:00:42.570> watt<00:00:42.629> amplifier<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> got<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to a 500 watt amplifier this is got a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
to a 500 watt amplifier this is got a
250<00:00:44.610> watt<00:00:44.700> amplifier<00:00:44.940> between<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.170> we're

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
250 watt amplifier between the two we're

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.010 
250 watt amplifier between the two we're
getting<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> better<00:00:47.070> mid<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> warmer<00:00:48.480> sound

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
getting a better mid and a warmer sound

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
getting a better mid and a warmer sound
I<00:00:49.079> think<00:00:49.469> getting<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.980> more<00:00:50.070> bass

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
I think getting a little bit more bass

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
I think getting a little bit more bass
out<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> 15<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.420> expected<00:00:51.960> because

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
out of the 15 which is expected because

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869 
out of the 15 which is expected because
you're<00:00:52.289> talking<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> 10<00:00:52.949> inch<00:00:53.129> 10<00:00:53.850> inch

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you're talking about a 10 inch 10 inch

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
you're talking about a 10 inch 10 inch
driver<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> bottom<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:55.020> 15<00:00:55.350> inch<00:00:55.530> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
driver in the bottom and a 15 inch but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.939 
driver in the bottom and a 15 inch but
the<00:00:56.190> part<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.430> surprised<00:00:56.850> me<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:58.590> warm

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the part that surprised me was the warm

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.490 
the part that surprised me was the warm
sound<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> 15<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> larger<00:01:01.170> cabinet

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
sound from the 15 it's a larger cabinet

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.599 
sound from the 15 it's a larger cabinet
that's<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> help<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> warmer

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that's going to help with the warmer

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
that's going to help with the warmer
sound<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.449> overall<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.049> didn't<00:01:04.439> expect<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
sound but overall I didn't expect and I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.890 
sound but overall I didn't expect and I
was<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.939> bit<00:01:06.060> surprised<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.750> the

needs<00:01:29.820> are<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.479> you're<00:01:30.659> looking<00:01:30.960> for

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
needs are if you're looking for

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
needs are if you're looking for
something<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.560> could<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> standalone

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
something that could be a standalone

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
something that could be a standalone
speaker<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> could<00:01:33.570> run<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.049> maybe<00:01:34.350> 80%<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
speaker that could run for maybe 80% of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
speaker that could run for maybe 80% of
your<00:01:35.189> events<00:01:35.640> where<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> be

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
your events where you're going to be

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.929 
your events where you're going to be
doing<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.900> backyard<00:01:37.079> events<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.759> you're

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
doing some backyard events and you're

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.280 
doing some backyard events and you're
going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.240> maybe<00:01:39.450> some<00:01:39.689> smaller<00:01:39.960> weddings

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
going to do maybe some smaller weddings

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
going to do maybe some smaller weddings
and<00:01:40.439> things<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.729> need<00:01:41.880> us

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and things and you really don't need us

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
and things and you really don't need us
up<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.450> would<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.380> 15<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.220> problem<00:01:44.579> with

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
up I would think the 15 the problem with

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450 
up I would think the 15 the problem with
the<00:01:44.790> 15<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> any<00:01:45.689> 15<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.649> big<00:01:46.979> if

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the 15 and any 15 is it's just big if

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
the 15 and any 15 is it's just big if
you<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> smaller<00:01:48.090> person<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> large

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you are a smaller person I'm a large

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
you are a smaller person I'm a large
person<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:49.979> me<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.700> pick<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.270> such

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
person so for me to pick it up and such

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.270 
person so for me to pick it up and such
it's<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.750> too<00:01:51.899> bad<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.290> mean<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> heavy<00:01:52.829> but

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it's not too bad I mean it's heavy but

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's not too bad I mean it's heavy but
their<00:01:53.460> handles<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.880> handles<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.299> top<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
their handles just handles on top and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
their handles just handles on top and
the<00:01:54.810> sides<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.259> such<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.799> well<00:01:56.070> balanced

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the sides and such it's well balanced

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.969 
the sides and such it's well balanced
and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.909> does<00:01:57.060> pretty<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.680> I'm<00:01:58.890> going

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
and it does pretty well but if I'm going

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
and it does pretty well but if I'm going
to<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.130> sending<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.460> may<00:01:59.759> female<00:02:00.210> DJs<00:02:00.540> which

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to be sending out may female DJs which

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.209 
to be sending out may female DJs which
I've<00:02:00.930> had<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.469> there's<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> lot<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> female

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I've had over there's a lot of female

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
I've had over there's a lot of female
DJs<00:02:02.750> looking<00:02:03.750> at<00:02:03.810> something<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> 10

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
DJs looking at something like the 10

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.510 
DJs looking at something like the 10
it's<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> lot<00:02:05.100> easier<00:02:05.130> because

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it's going to be a lot easier because

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
it's going to be a lot easier because
again<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.149> handles<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.439> on

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
again there's handles and nice and on

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.919 
again there's handles and nice and on
placement<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> great<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.629> smaller

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
placement is great but it's a smaller

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.660 
placement is great but it's a smaller
cabinet<00:02:10.349> it's

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
cabinet it's

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.070 
cabinet it's
easier<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.970> handle<00:02:11.330> easier<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:11.690> get<00:02:11.810> up<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.050> a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
easier to handle easier to get up on a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.170 
easier to handle easier to get up on a
stand<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.620> some<00:02:12.800> sort<00:02:13.040> if<00:02:13.610> you're<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:14.000> little

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
stand of some sort if you're a little

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.540 
stand of some sort if you're a little
bit<00:02:14.270> smaller<00:02:14.540> person<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.830> 15<00:02:16.220> could<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.520> a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
bit smaller person the 15 could be a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.699 
bit smaller person the 15 could be a
stand<00:02:17.180> alone<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.599> more<00:02:17.780> events<00:02:17.959> than<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.410> 10

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
stand alone for more events than a 10

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.920 
stand alone for more events than a 10
but<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.370> 10<00:02:19.640> would<00:02:19.910> be<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> wonderful<00:02:20.360> backup

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
but the 10 would be a wonderful backup

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.720 
but the 10 would be a wonderful backup
it<00:02:21.230> could<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.500> ceremony<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.190> do<00:02:22.280> backyard

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it could do ceremony can do backyard

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.550 
it could do ceremony can do backyard
parties<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> lot<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.599> things<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.470> just

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
parties can do a lot of things it's just

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.050 
parties can do a lot of things it's just
when<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.459> need<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> little<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:25.940> more

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
when you need a little bit more

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.699 
when you need a little bit more
horsepower<00:02:26.180> you've<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.020> go<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> 15

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
horsepower you've got to go with the 15

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.770 
horsepower you've got to go with the 15
let's<00:02:28.340> take<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.520> quick<00:02:28.790> side-by-side<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
let's take a quick side-by-side and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.870 
let's take a quick side-by-side and
listen<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.440> 2<00:02:30.620> or<00:02:30.860> only<00:02:31.610> using<00:02:31.819> the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
listen to the 2 or only using the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.550 
listen to the 2 or only using the
microphone<00:02:32.150> on<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> camera<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.840> we're<00:02:33.020> just

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
microphone on the camera and we're just

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.930 
microphone on the camera and we're just
using<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:33.980> bit<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.400> sample<00:02:34.819> we're

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
using a little bit of a sample we're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
using a little bit of a sample we're
running<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.300> through<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.870> low<00:02:36.170> quality<00:02:36.319> it's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
running it through and low quality it's

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.140 
running it through and low quality it's
not<00:02:37.190> gonna<00:02:37.310> be<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.489> greatest<00:02:37.819> but<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.000> might

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
not gonna be the greatest but it might

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.089 
not gonna be the greatest but it might
give<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.480> little<00:02:38.750> idea<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.350> this

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
give you a little idea of this

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.680 
give you a little idea of this
difference<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.670> sound<00:02:40.880> let's<00:02:41.450> serve<00:02:41.569> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
difference in the sound let's serve the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.190 
difference in the sound let's serve the
CPX

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
CPX

00:02:42.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
CPX
10<00:02:42.410> a<00:03:03.400> 15<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.340> might<00:03:16.459> have<00:03:16.549> been<00:03:16.640> able<00:03:16.760> to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
10 a 15 a so you might have been able to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.800 
10 a 15 a so you might have been able to
hear<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> little<00:03:17.150> bit<00:03:17.299> of<00:03:17.390> difference<00:03:17.690> between

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
hear a little bit of difference between

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.380 
hear a little bit of difference between
the<00:03:18.109> two<00:03:18.160> really<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.400> find<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> biggest

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
the two really I find that the biggest

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.390 
the two really I find that the biggest
difference<00:03:20.840> was<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.470> warmer<00:03:21.829> sound<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.310> I'm

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
difference was the warmer sound that I'm
