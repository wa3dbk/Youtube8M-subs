that comes around will never force a

that comes around will never force a

make<00:03:27.570> around<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.170> could<00:03:28.560> technically<00:03:29.070> block

make around I could technically block
that<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.240> gonna<00:03:30.330> hit<00:03:30.480> me<00:03:30.630> it

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
that and it's not gonna hit me it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.930 
that and it's not gonna hit me it
doesn't<00:03:30.990> force<00:03:31.230> me<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.470> move<00:03:31.910> unlike<00:03:32.910> a

doesn't force me to move unlike a
straight<00:03:33.300> shot<00:03:33.510> does<00:03:34.130> but<00:03:35.130> let's<00:03:35.640> look<00:03:35.850> at<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
straight shot does but let's look at the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.670 
straight shot does but let's look at the
proper<00:03:36.510> tactic<00:03:37.140> we're<00:03:37.230> going<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.410> incorporate

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
proper tactic we're going to incorporate

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.270 
proper tactic we're going to incorporate
into<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.690> now<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:40.020> showed<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.710> they're<00:03:40.890> very

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
into this now I showed you they're very

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.040 
into this now I showed you they're very
basically<00:03:41.670> how<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.880> block<00:03:42.210> now<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> don't<00:03:42.690> wait

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
basically how to block now I don't wait

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.720 
basically how to block now I don't wait
a<00:03:43.080> block<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.800> what<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.160> call<00:03:44.670> a

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
a block because it's what I call a

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.720 
a block because it's what I call a
secondary<00:03:45.690> reaction<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.560> want<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> primary

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
secondary reaction I want a primary

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.030 
secondary reaction I want a primary
function<00:03:47.940> which<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:48.990> going<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.200> be<00:03:49.380> invading

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
function which is going to be invading

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.550 
function which is going to be invading
and<00:03:50.310> set<00:03:50.580> one<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.900> principle<00:03:52.440> of

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and set one that is the principle of

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.800 
and set one that is the principle of
what<00:03:52.710> we<00:03:52.830> call<00:03:53.070> blocking<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.850> striking<00:03:54.720> it

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
what we call blocking and striking it

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.350 
what we call blocking and striking it
simultaneously<00:03:55.460> and<00:03:56.460> I'll<00:03:56.550> explain<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
simultaneously and I'll explain this to

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.620 
simultaneously and I'll explain this to
you

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
you

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.680 
you
if<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.230> throw<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.530> haymaker<00:03:59.010> round<00:03:59.370> if<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.360> block

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
if you throw a haymaker round if I block

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.750 
if you throw a haymaker round if I block
like<00:04:00.990> most<00:04:01.230> systems<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.160> then<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.490> throw<00:04:02.730> a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
like most systems do and then I throw a

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.390 
like most systems do and then I throw a
shot<00:04:03.030> like<00:04:03.210> this<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.260> problem<00:04:04.560> is<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> space

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
shot like this the problem is is a space

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.190 
shot like this the problem is is a space
and<00:04:05.670> timing<00:04:06.030> gap<00:04:06.210> on<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.480> inside<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.050> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
and timing gap on the inside of that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.280 
and timing gap on the inside of that
where<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.710> attacker<00:04:08.190> could<00:04:08.520> hit<00:04:08.730> me<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.300> more

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
where my attacker could hit me and more

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.870 
where my attacker could hit me and more
than<00:04:10.320> likely<00:04:10.500> if<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> attacker<00:04:11.520> throws<00:04:11.760> a

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
than likely if the attacker throws a

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.510 
than likely if the attacker throws a
haymaker<00:04:12.420> around<00:04:12.960> if<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.890> park<00:04:14.280> you're

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
haymaker around if I park you're

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.099 
haymaker around if I park you're
probably<00:04:14.700> both<00:04:14.940> want<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.300> throw<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> secondary

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
probably both want to throw a secondary

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.890 
probably both want to throw a secondary
shot<00:04:16.500> round<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.489> ends<00:04:17.910> up<00:04:18.000> being<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.570> game

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
shot round and it ends up being a game

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.730 
shot round and it ends up being a game
of<00:04:19.200> speed<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.100> agility<00:04:20.870> well<00:04:21.870> as<00:04:22.170> most<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.650> us

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
of speed and agility well as most of us

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.500 
of speed and agility well as most of us
know<00:04:22.980> as<00:04:23.130> we<00:04:23.310> get<00:04:23.460> older<00:04:23.820> we<00:04:23.940> start<00:04:23.970> losing

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
know as we get older we start losing

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.590 
know as we get older we start losing
speed<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.560> agility<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.340> some<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.390> us<00:04:27.480> with

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
speed and agility and some of us with

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.570 
speed and agility and some of us with
our<00:04:27.720> busy<00:04:28.080> lifestyles<00:04:28.800> can't<00:04:29.130> afford<00:04:29.400> to

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
our busy lifestyles can't afford to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.530 
our busy lifestyles can't afford to
train<00:04:30.080> 24/7<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> better<00:04:32.400> option<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.360> to

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
train 24/7 so a better option is to

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.110 
train 24/7 so a better option is to
fight<00:04:33.750> smarter<00:04:34.560> rather<00:04:35.160> than<00:04:35.460> harder<00:04:35.910> all<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
fight smarter rather than harder all the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.390 
fight smarter rather than harder all the
time<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.710> ability<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.160> be<00:04:38.280> on<00:04:38.370> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
time and that is the ability of be on a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.180 
time and that is the ability of be on a
block<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.760> strike<00:04:39.180> simultaneously<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:41.040> what

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
block of strike simultaneously so what

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.920 
block of strike simultaneously so what
you'd<00:04:41.340> be<00:04:41.400> doing<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.820> your<00:04:42.000> hand<00:04:42.300> we<00:04:42.510> bent<00:04:42.750> like

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
you'd be doing is your hand we bent like

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.170 
you'd be doing is your hand we bent like
so<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.650> we're<00:04:44.100> gonna<00:04:44.220> trap<00:04:44.550> over<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.940> top<00:04:45.150> of

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
so and we're gonna trap over the top of

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.480 
so and we're gonna trap over the top of
the<00:04:45.330> elbow<00:04:45.510> joint<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.260> at<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.680> same<00:04:46.890> time<00:04:47.250> I'm

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
the elbow joint and at the same time I'm

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.070 
the elbow joint and at the same time I'm
going<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.640> launch<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.270> strike<00:04:48.690> into<00:04:48.900> his

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
going to launch a strike into his

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.700 
going to launch a strike into his
eyeballs<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:50.669> you<00:04:50.880> can't<00:04:51.150> see<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.930> can't<00:04:52.230> find

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
eyeballs if you can't see you can't find

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.070 
eyeballs if you can't see you can't find
it<00:04:53.040> as<00:04:53.160> simple<00:04:53.580> as<00:04:53.790> that<00:04:54.030> we're<00:04:54.630> talking<00:04:54.840> about

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
it as simple as that we're talking about

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.460 
it as simple as that we're talking about
a<00:04:55.410> realistic<00:04:56.010> Street<00:04:56.520> or<00:04:56.760> antenna<00:04:57.210> option<00:04:57.870> not

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
a realistic Street or antenna option not

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.000 
a realistic Street or antenna option not
a<00:04:58.710> sport<00:04:59.520> orientated<00:05:00.360> option<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.740> I've<00:05:01.860> been

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
a sport orientated option so I've been

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.159 
a sport orientated option so I've been
here<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:03.000> training<00:05:03.270> purposes<00:05:03.600> today<00:05:04.020> I

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
here and the training purposes today I

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.830 
here and the training purposes today I
am<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.590> hands<00:05:04.980> up<00:05:05.100> like<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.610> as<00:05:06.150> if<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.720> was

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
am the hands up like so as if I was
