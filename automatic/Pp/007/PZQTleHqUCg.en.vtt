00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.540
 special in 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.590
 but this is not our home 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 this is the house of surreal or surreal 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.610
 said by some who knows who but why not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.080
 It is mixed but the day the floor there 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.500
 explains in a famous of the roof there is not 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.750
 not even the ceiling but how it is possible 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.910
 we have seen from the last video that not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 because we had fun together with you 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 I remember when it blew us up 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.239
 the criteria in the house of when you filled yourself 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 of your home 's entrance 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.370
 when he stole the energy of when 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.949
 left us the anchor when then 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 we used to stick to each other 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.379
 of how many who launches threshing floor 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 threw arrows at and have 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.230
 killed in reality and by how many hours e 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.290
 hours and hours in the past in our house 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.120

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.800

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.420
