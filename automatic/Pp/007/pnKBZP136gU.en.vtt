00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:13.320
 we have the nexus 7 of course 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:15.820
 also in action show the lockscreen 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.529
 some of them may be the camera 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.300
 app that you otherwise directly access 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.099
 That may be simply because of that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.869
 no camera is installed here 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.970
 Finally, the back is missing 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.210
 Camera only the front camera up here 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.849
 for video chat for but there is the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.230
 direct access to the google app and 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 is quite interesting she does not have now 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.050
 More just this normal search function 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.900
 but on the basis of our location 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.260
 so try interesting information 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:50.050
 to indicate the case the local weather in 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.320
 leipzig but that goes on in the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.460
 Ideal case, for example 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.310
 traffic data is displayed or 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.040
 We are approaching a train or 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.350
 bus stop then should the program 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:08.939
 be able to be back the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.920
 to indicate departure times 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.590
 as well as the example 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.439
 current results of our favorite 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.509
 sports club or the exchange rate for 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.609
 the currency in the country we are in 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.859
 So everything is right now 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.109
 useful things in this problem 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.689
 Germany only works so far 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.329
 but that will be limited 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:35.259
 change the future 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.600
 Let's go on the homescreen like 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.209
 you can then go through the side 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.520
 the individual homescreens boot between 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:44.350
 two are already designed before 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.600
 Central home screen provides access 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.029
 the library found on our level 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 me these three books before maybe 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:56.069
 one or the other still from the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.069
 German meets knows 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.970
 as well on all exclusive devices 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.950
 available or for download 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:16.800
 then free is Transformers 3 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:18.990
 the movie and on the second 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.820
 homescreen then just in the top 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.830
 area current recommendations from the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.270
 google places 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.730
 Of course, this should be something to buy 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.240
 then you will simply be enticed down 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.540
 we install apps ourselves 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.030
 have chosen 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.780
 new is then this bar with 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 Quick access to six important apps 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:50.160
 like the music player or the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.520
 video playback of course on the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.520
 browser 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.780
 in the middle of this central allows 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.040
 then click it 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.870
 all installed apps and vale 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.240
 install with joke to see that 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.530
 very practical and yes the others 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:30.060
 homescreen are then for the course 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.800
 own design free what maybe 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.520
 already noticed our little ones 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.090
 showing here 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:42.269
 the whole thing is very very soft project 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.760
 but i'll be successful 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.070
 really at least here in combination 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.459
 processor with the tegra 2 is the 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.989
 impresses fluently if we so 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.620
 switch between apps back and forth 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.620
 this is almost instantaneous 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.280
 quite impressive for his 200 euro 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.670
 device is of course also powerful 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.590
 the graphic part of tegra 3 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:18.390
 that you can taste some examples 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:21.950
 show force it is a hack'n'slay 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.340
 So almost to diablo clone 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:31.490
 You steer an angel through the area 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.490
 can expand various skills 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.039
 objects collect classic halt 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.400
 all that graphically very little at all 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.730
 motion control down here on the left 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.180
 the skin on it directly in the control 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.180
 circle 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.300
 so much for that little bit better on the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.250
 tablet control is designed this 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.100
 pafl 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.010
 In the game we have to get a liquid 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.330
 through the api are moving and that 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.380
 just happens by tilting the 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.370
 Tablets have to take care and 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.520
 have different liquids 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.660
 of course, water will become properties 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.780
 it evaporates when it is near fire 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.930
 and should accordingly 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.160
 behind quickly over it as well should 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.230
 be careful that we have the 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.180
 liquid held together as possible 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.340
 otherwise we lose so happy times 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.790
 parts of it then we are with indication 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.810
 left that is not just graphically whole 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.560
 stimulate but also the 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.520
 Physics calculations are natural 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.520
 some ago 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.560
 Of course, it's also very pleasing 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.780
 to have games 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.440
 The really on tablets control 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.230
 are designed and not just try 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.770
 in the end, burned to the pc area 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.770
 copy 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.409
 so that is also your decency free 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.180
 All in all, we have to tell you 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.240
 very impressed what asus and brain 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.759
 in the face of cooperation 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.379
 the price of just under 200 euros 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:02.620
 but pretty convincing on the device 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:05.050
 the display like the 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.669
 viewing angle stability is in practice 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.900
 We can do that relatively high here 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:14.159
 only limited again 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.039
 that is it leaves so hardly wishes open 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:19.690
 what we still have to criticize that 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:23.370
 then we will speak our regular text 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.370
 of diving clubs to de
