00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of the es word for AC from after in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.400 
of the es word for AC from after in
Genesis<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> we'll<00:00:36.300> try<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.140> make<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
Genesis so we'll try to make this

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.810 
Genesis so we'll try to make this
somewhat<00:00:37.829> quick<00:00:38.190> look<00:00:38.850> at<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> details<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
somewhat quick look at the details and

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.139 
somewhat quick look at the details and
then<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.090> sound<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.629> well<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.149> mechanism

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
then the sound as well and the mechanism

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.069 
then the sound as well and the mechanism
so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.160> guess<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> we'll<00:00:48.809> take<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so I guess that's it and we'll take a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.069 
so I guess that's it and we'll take a
look<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> details<00:00:49.680> right<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.510> ok<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.539> the

quality<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.090> even<00:02:13.240> no<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:15.340> don't<00:02:15.970> think

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
quality and even no and I don't think

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
quality and even no and I don't think
about<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.990> style<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> grilles

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
about it for the style and the grilles

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.760 
about it for the style and the grilles
are<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.580> nice<00:02:21.820> addition<00:02:22.530> another<00:02:23.530> thing<00:02:23.740> I

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
are it's a nice addition another thing I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.710 
are it's a nice addition another thing I
mentioned<00:02:23.950> really<00:02:24.220> quick<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.120> side

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
mentioned really quick is that the side

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.750 
mentioned really quick is that the side
cab<00:02:26.080> windows<00:02:26.470> are<00:02:26.650> tinted<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> prototype

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
cab windows are tinted on the prototype

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.580 
cab windows are tinted on the prototype
or<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.180> like<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:28.930> are<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> prototype

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
or like like they are on the prototype

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.130 
or like like they are on the prototype
which<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.630> nice<00:02:31.630> little<00:02:31.660> thing<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.110> I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
which is a nice little thing that I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.880 
which is a nice little thing that I
think<00:02:32.200> only<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.560> fan<00:02:32.800> genesis<00:02:33.130> does<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:34.890> think

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
think only a fan genesis does so I think

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.230 
think only a fan genesis does so I think
that's<00:02:36.220> about<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.459> just<00:02:36.640> wanted<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> cover

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
that's about it just wanted to cover

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.449 
that's about it just wanted to cover
those<00:02:37.420> details<00:02:37.810> right<00:02:38.410> quick

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
those details right quick

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.790 
those details right quick
but<00:02:40.030> now<00:02:40.600> we'll<00:02:40.990> take<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.170> look<00:02:41.320> at<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.470> sound

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
but now we'll take a look at the sound

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.920 
but now we'll take a look at the sound
and<00:02:42.130> then<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.459> few<00:02:43.060> quick<00:02:43.360> running<00:02:43.600> clips

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
and then do a few quick running clips

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.990 
and then do a few quick running clips
hopefully<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:45.370> we're<00:02:45.459> kind<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.670> tight<00:02:45.850> on

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
hopefully but we're kind of tight on

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.330 
hopefully but we're kind of tight on
time<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.690> I'll<00:02:46.780> try<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.959> keep<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.260> short<00:02:47.530> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
time so I'll try to keep this short so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.680 
time so I'll try to keep this short so
let's<00:02:49.180> check<00:02:49.780> out<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.050> sound<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.650> lighting

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
let's check out the sound and lighting

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:06.130 
let's check out the sound and lighting
okay<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:53.200> you'll<00:02:53.440> hear<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> startup

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.470 

one<00:03:06.890> thing<00:03:07.040> you'll<00:03:07.130> notice<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.490> that<00:03:07.520> compared

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
one thing you'll notice is that compared

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.300 
one thing you'll notice is that compared
to<00:03:08.570> like<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.810> earlier<00:03:09.170> intimate<00:03:09.590> ones<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
to like the earlier intimate ones the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.450 
to like the earlier intimate ones the
startup<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.210> much<00:03:11.630> longer<00:03:11.950> when<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> speaker

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
startup is much longer when the speaker

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.930 
startup is much longer when the speaker
is<00:03:13.490> more<00:03:13.850> bassy<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:15.800> that's<00:03:16.730> another

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
is more bassy so that's that's another

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.460 
is more bassy so that's that's another
advantage<00:03:17.300> but<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.650> think<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.700> sound<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
advantage but I think in sound the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.400 
advantage but I think in sound the
pretty<00:03:22.160> close<00:03:23.020> but<00:03:24.020> again<00:03:24.230> at<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.560> second

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
pretty close but again at the on second

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.870 
pretty close but again at the on second
if<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.710> want<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> propulsion<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.670> suck

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
if you want to see a propulsion go suck

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.979 
if you want to see a propulsion go suck
out

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
out

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.930 
out
and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.390 
and
so<00:03:30.150> there's<00:03:30.930> no<00:03:31.050> difficulty<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.740> license<00:03:32.220> on

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
so there's no difficulty of license on

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.860 
so there's no difficulty of license on
the<00:03:32.490> sentences

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.890 

okay

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.290 

bitch

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.190 

that's<00:03:50.960> too

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:10.400 

energy

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.759 

yes

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
yes

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:20.340 
yes
the<00:04:13.769> real<00:04:13.920> light<00:04:14.129> will<00:04:14.370> come<00:04:14.819> for<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.120> food

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.000 

yeah<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.380> can<00:04:21.620> hear<00:04:21.860> actually<00:04:22.370> can't<00:04:22.970> hear<00:04:24.010> how

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
yeah I can hear actually can't hear how

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.200 
yeah I can hear actually can't hear how
quiet<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:26.050> yeah<00:04:27.050> which<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.800> nice<00:04:28.370> when<00:04:29.120> you

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
quiet the yeah which is nice when you

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.210 
quiet the yeah which is nice when you
mute<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.600> locomotives<00:04:30.140> alright<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:30.980> think

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
mute the locomotives alright so I think

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.820 
mute the locomotives alright so I think
that's<00:04:31.580> about<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.660> for<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.200> sound<00:04:33.530> and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
that's about it for the sound and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.260 
that's about it for the sound and
details<00:04:34.250> hopefully<00:04:34.640> gives<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.940> sense<00:04:35.180> of

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
details hopefully gives you a sense of

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.210 
details hopefully gives you a sense of
what<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:35.480> look<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.750> what<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.900> was<00:04:35.990> like<00:04:36.220> that

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
what the look of what it was like that

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.410 
what the look of what it was like that
wasn't<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.760> super<00:04:38.390> in-depth<00:04:38.870> video<00:04:39.350> but

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
wasn't a super in-depth video but

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.460 
wasn't a super in-depth video but
hopefully<00:04:41.420> that<00:04:41.540> gives<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.720> some<00:04:41.930> idea<00:04:42.170> and

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
hopefully that gives you some idea and

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.560 
hopefully that gives you some idea and
with<00:04:42.650> look<00:04:42.860> ones<00:04:43.040> like<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.550> think<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.180> retails

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
with look ones like I think it retails

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.470 
with look ones like I think it retails
for<00:04:44.720> about<00:04:45.710> three<00:04:46.130> hundred<00:04:46.280> with<00:04:46.550> sound<00:04:46.820> and

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
for about three hundred with sound and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.860 
for about three hundred with sound and
about<00:04:47.780> two<00:04:48.110> hundred<00:04:48.320> without<00:04:48.770> sound<00:04:49.010> but<00:04:49.870> yeah

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
about two hundred without sound but yeah

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.780 
about two hundred without sound but yeah
I<00:04:50.900> mean<00:04:51.140> I<00:04:51.230> think<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.650> picked<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.280> up<00:04:52.460> for<00:04:52.640> like

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
I mean I think I picked this up for like

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.020 
I mean I think I picked this up for like
220<00:04:53.360> which<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.720> pretty<00:04:53.960> good<00:04:54.110> deal<00:04:55.030> because

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
220 which is a pretty good deal because

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.680 
220 which is a pretty good deal because
there<00:04:56.510> were<00:04:56.600> somewhat<00:04:57.080> recent<00:04:57.740> releases<00:04:58.690> but

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
there were somewhat recent releases but

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.940 
there were somewhat recent releases but
in<00:04:59.870> my<00:04:59.990> opinion<00:05:00.080> they're<00:05:00.560> really<00:05:00.800> nice

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
in my opinion they're really nice

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.190 
in my opinion they're really nice
locomotives<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.700> I<00:05:02.180> love<00:05:02.510> having<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.900> it's<00:05:03.110> a
