00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello and welcome because one 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:11.880

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.940
 make us the big freeze engine today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.000
 there are extremely tall trees where you look 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.830
 super install or better said 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 could have in and I just see that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:31.800
 and these trees are actually me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.649
 generally the same time the world ok and so 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.899
 Now we are big in a new world 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.960
 chris noth and here we see it already 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.770
 new trees they are really big 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 and very weird but I find them 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 extremely cool can say yes are 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 really huge trees and that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.170
 it was actually about also by the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:05.629
 motto yes and yes and he had and you 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.629
 that 's it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.689
 different just creative 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 oh yes and emotions of the system fast 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.270
 switch to short otherwise stutter armchair 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.100
 yes okay that's a bit 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:31.259
 stutter was the edges of the team 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.189
 okay that's the trees because 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.200
 the world now instead of and yes that what 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.590
 really format and we 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.409
 Say goodbye now why 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:56.930
 should not complain like this 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.930
 both and yes 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:11.460
 okay, yes, I'll be there as well 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:14.310
 this motto still the tempo that is 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.650
 is a motto for the chambers and trees 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:23.100
 For example, there is one blow 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.550
 only with an ax and now everything is breaking 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.880
 together but just starts a little bit 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's all gone away normally 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.830
 you do not see it exactly but now it is 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 everything away 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:53.459
 the first ones are awesome so that 's it now 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.000
 hope the place and we say goodbye 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:02.299
 will be back next time 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.019

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.019
