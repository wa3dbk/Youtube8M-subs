 preserve raspberries according to the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.569
 variety mature stepwise 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.670
 during the summer months and entered the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.280
 autumn so we can taste them 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.000
 during the months of July August 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.670
 September and October the fruits have 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.489
 be thick with the pulp consistent and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.260
 a bright and intense coloration 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.750
 they have to be hard and free of mold 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.440
 and they have to feel dry and cool 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.080

 the stem should be a green color 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.840
 I live the raspberries are picked when 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.420
 They are well mature and have lost all their 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.670
 acidity at the right moment of your 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.550
 ripening the raspberry is separated 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.430
 easily from the stem this fruit is 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.740
 extremely delicate and perishable since 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.410
 his numerous grains full of juices are 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.810
 so sensitive that handling the 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.970
 heat or just the contact of some 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.730
 with others it deteriorates so much its appearance 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.550
 as its quality once at home 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.730
 It is convenient to keep it unwashed and uncovered 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.780
 in a flat container in a single layer and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.660
 seal in the refrigerator
