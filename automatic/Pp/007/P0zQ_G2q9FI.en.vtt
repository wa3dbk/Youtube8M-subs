need to assemble to begin slacklining
now<00:00:12.420> we're<00:00:12.540> going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> show<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.139> put

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that together outside we're using a real

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.510 
that together outside we're using a real
short<00:00:15.690> version<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.410> two-inch<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
short version of a two-inch this is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.640 
short version of a two-inch this is
actually<00:00:17.760> an<00:00:17.820> inch<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.119> half<00:00:18.150> sling<00:00:18.650> but

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
actually an inch and a half sling but

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.720 
actually an inch and a half sling but
the<00:00:19.740> same<00:00:19.890> thing<00:00:20.039> if<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.220> had<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> real<00:00:20.550> long

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the same thing if you had a real long

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.130 
the same thing if you had a real long
when<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.210> make<00:00:21.359> several<00:00:21.660> laps<00:00:21.930> around

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
when you just make several laps around

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.050 
when you just make several laps around
the<00:00:22.350> tree<00:00:22.650> I've<00:00:23.250> got<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> short<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:23.880> that's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the tree I've got a short one that's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.640 
the tree I've got a short one that's
used<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.630> variety<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.199> i'm<00:00:25.320> using<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
used have a variety and i'm using a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
used have a variety and i'm using a
short<00:00:25.859> when<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.310> keep<00:00:26.789> things

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
short when you're just keep things

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
short when you're just keep things
simple<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:27.930> carabiner<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> two<00:00:28.890> eyes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
simple you just carabiner the two eyes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.120 
simple you just carabiner the two eyes
together<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.050> real<00:00:31.050> simple<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.920> grab

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
together like that real simple can grab

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
together like that real simple can grab
one<00:00:32.340> end<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.640> your<00:00:32.759> slack<00:00:33.000> line<00:00:33.270> we've<00:00:33.719> already

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
one end of your slack line we've already

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
one end of your slack line we've already
got<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.050> slack<00:00:34.380> line<00:00:34.590> laid<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
got the slack line laid out here on the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.220 
got the slack line laid out here on the
ground<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> make<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> video<00:00:36.090> shorter<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
ground to make the video shorter and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.720 
ground to make the video shorter and
then<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> end<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> slackline

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
then this is the end of the slackline

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
then this is the end of the slackline
that<00:00:39.090> you've<00:00:39.210> tied<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> overhand<00:00:40.350> loop<00:00:40.559> knot

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
that you've tied the overhand loop knot

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
that you've tied the overhand loop knot
in<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.030> put<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.239> loop<00:00:42.600> through<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
in so just put that loop through the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
in so just put that loop through the
beaner<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.789> make<00:00:44.910> sure

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
beaner like that kind of make sure

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.310 
beaner like that kind of make sure
everything's<00:00:45.510> oriented<00:00:46.020> towards<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
everything's oriented towards the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
everything's oriented towards the
opposite<00:00:46.739> tree<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
opposite tree and then just kind of a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
opposite tree and then just kind of a
feed<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.860> slack<00:00:50.039> line<00:00:50.250> through<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:50.760> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
feed your slack line through this way so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
feed your slack line through this way so
we'll<00:00:51.030> walk<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.480> miss<00:00:51.840> camera<00:00:52.140> lady

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
we'll walk down here miss camera lady

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.630 
we'll walk down here miss camera lady
and<00:00:52.730> keep<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> twist<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.539> slice<00:00:54.750> on

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and keep the twist out of our slice on

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.380 
and keep the twist out of our slice on
the<00:00:56.640> other<00:00:56.760> tree<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.840> done<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> same<00:00:58.260> thing

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
the other tree we've done the same thing

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
the other tree we've done the same thing
except<00:01:00.390> no<00:01:00.480> miss<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:01.949> where

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
we have the ratcheting cargo strap
handle<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.240> place<00:01:06.479> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
handle so you see we just place that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
handle so you see we just place that
down<00:01:06.869> through<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> beaner<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
down through the beaner they see that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.000 
down through the beaner they see that
Miss<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.430> lay<00:01:08.610> yeah<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.450> side<00:01:10.010> alright

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Miss can lay yeah the other side alright

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.399 
Miss can lay yeah the other side alright
so<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.310> we'll<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> Ranchin<00:01:12.330> slot<00:01:13.080> in

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so now we'll get the I Ranchin slot in

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
so now we'll get the I Ranchin slot in
the<00:01:13.439> spool<00:01:13.830> where<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.670> vertical<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.420> it's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the spool where it's vertical so it's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
the spool where it's vertical so it's
easy<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> stick<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.590> through<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> stick<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
easy to stick this through the stick the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.840 
easy to stick this through the stick the
webbing<00:01:18.119> through<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.729> makes<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
webbing through there like that makes it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
webbing through there like that makes it
just<00:01:21.060> pull<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> slack<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> like

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
just pull all the slack out of it like

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.910 
just pull all the slack out of it like
so<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> tighter<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> pull<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so the tighter you pull it here is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
so the tighter you pull it here is
unless<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> crank<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> we're<00:01:27.930> going

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
unless you have to crank so we're going

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.499 
unless you have to crank so we're going
to<00:01:28.110> pull<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.329> much<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
to pull all that like that much of the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.179 
to pull all that like that much of the
slack<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.950> tighten

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
slack out as we can then we can tighten

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.350 
slack out as we can then we can tighten
it<00:01:33.110> see<00:01:34.110> what's<00:01:34.290> happening<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:36.299> it

it see what's happening here I think it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.550 
it see what's happening here I think it
builds<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.700> real<00:01:38.700> layer

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
builds up a little real layer

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
builds up a little real layer
so<00:01:41.220> excited<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:43.579> okay<00:01:44.579> there<00:01:45.000> you

have<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.509> how<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> set<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:45.960> slack<00:01:46.320> line

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
have it that's how to set up slack line

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.920 
have it that's how to set up slack line
if<00:01:47.579> you've<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> brand<00:01:48.119> new<00:01:48.180> slackline<00:01:48.750> like

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
if you've got a brand new slackline like

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
if you've got a brand new slackline like
we<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.200> described<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.039> knots<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.490> tied

we just described all the knots you tied

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.569 
we just described all the knots you tied
for<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.509> loop<00:01:52.500> knots<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.100> tighten

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
for the loop knots are going to tighten

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
for the loop knots are going to tighten
so<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.329> tend<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> loosen<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> get

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so this will tend to loosen as you get

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.320 
so this will tend to loosen as you get
on<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.680> load<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.210> back

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and retention the line a couple times

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.100 
and retention the line a couple times
while<00:01:59.220> your<00:01:59.460> knots<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.090> tight<00:02:00.330> but
