just like I think it was a hundred sheet

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
just like I think it was a hundred sheet
but<00:01:43.320> they're<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.590> little<00:01:43.710> circle<00:01:44.130> sticky

notes<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:46.020> down<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
notes and right here right down the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.569 
notes and right here right down the
middle<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> where<00:01:47.430> they're

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
middle right there is where they're

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
middle right there is where they're
actually<00:01:47.759> sticky<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.049> part<00:01:49.290> right

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
actually sticky like this part right

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
actually sticky like this part right
here<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.640> sticky<00:01:50.909> so

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
here and here are not actually sticky so

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
here and here are not actually sticky so
just<00:01:51.600> write<00:01:51.869> them<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.259> circles<00:01:52.710> for

which<00:05:00.860> is<00:05:00.979> super<00:05:01.220> cool<00:05:01.490> I've<00:05:01.759> never<00:05:02.000> had<00:05:02.270> these

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509

which is super cool I've never had these
before<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:03.199> I<00:05:03.650> think<00:05:03.830> these<00:05:03.979> are<00:05:04.039> really

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
before and I think these are really

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.040 
before and I think these are really
convenient<00:05:04.729> so<00:05:05.270> like<00:05:05.419> when<00:05:05.569> you<00:05:05.630> click<00:05:05.930> it

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
convenient so like when you click it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.779 
convenient so like when you click it
close<00:05:06.349> this<00:05:06.650> little<00:05:06.800> plastic<00:05:07.099> cover<00:05:07.520> goes

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
close this little plastic cover goes

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.570 
close this little plastic cover goes
over<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.389> doesn't<00:05:08.449> dry<00:05:08.780> out<00:05:09.280> they<00:05:10.280> claim

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
over it so it doesn't dry out they claim

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.240 
over it so it doesn't dry out they claim
to<00:05:10.610> be<00:05:10.759> smear<00:05:11.150> guard<00:05:11.650> they<00:05:12.650> haven't<00:05:12.800> smeared

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
to be smear guard they haven't smeared

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.830 
to be smear guard they haven't smeared
on<00:05:13.400> me<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:13.819> I<00:05:13.849> guess<00:05:14.180> they're<00:05:14.360> pretty<00:05:14.539> smear

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
on me so I guess they're pretty smear

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.070 
on me so I guess they're pretty smear
guard<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:15.919> I<00:05:16.130> really<00:05:16.520> love<00:05:16.610> these<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.539> far<00:05:17.780> and
