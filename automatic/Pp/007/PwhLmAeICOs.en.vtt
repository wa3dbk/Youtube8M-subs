use that on the fuse no heat transfer

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
use that on the fuse no heat transfer
because<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.040> outside<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> tank<00:01:32.479> the

far as the return pump goes I upgraded

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.990 
far as the return pump goes I upgraded
that<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> cobalt<00:01:49.350> MJ<00:01:49.740> 1200<00:01:51.140> produces<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:53.000> 295
