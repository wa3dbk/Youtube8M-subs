00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.050
 and this is the 11th edition of the heading light at the end 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.689
 a random house dedicated to light tanks 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.790
 I want to draw your attention to the fact that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.740
 the description of this video has a list of tanks 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.780
 on which the video was made in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670
 under this heading so before 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.400
 write the name of the next light tank 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.610
 please look at this list but 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.440
 Today, at your request, I will tell you about 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 t71 american light tank of the seventh 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 level which despite the appearance 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 bulldog is still very relevant in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.489
 random 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.949
 for starters, I would like some as usual 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.390
 tell about the technical characteristics 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.190
 our today's hero and then 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.830
 discuss in more detail the fight that you 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.629
 Now you can watch and so the dynamics of 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.670
 our firefly is very good 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.549
 maximum speed forward 64 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.409
 kilometers per hour ago 23 maneuverability 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.809
 the tank is great so you can 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.930
 shine active a good reservation 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.060
 t71 is not foreseen everywhere no more than 25 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.650
 millimeters so go straight to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 cannon unlike his brother 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.810
 bulldog 71 has only one top 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.880
 gun with a loading drum for six 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 shells piercing with a sabot projectile 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.120
 is 175 millimeters cumulative 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.010
 210 one-time damage 150 points accuracy 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.300
 leaves much to be desired scatter by 100 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.400
 meters 039 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.260
 time information is quite comfortable but 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.110
 is 2 point three seconds 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.330
 fully drum rechargeable for 20 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.160
 seconds without any modifiers and between 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.820
 shots recharge is two 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.950
 seconds 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.900
 vertical alignment angles could be 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.490
 and better but also what is available in 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.230
 principle down enough gun 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.960
 goes down by 7 degrees 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.600
 rises to 20 our firefly review 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.670
 good 400 meters must be set 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.990
 enlightened optics but disguise 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.640
 could be better 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.040
 when shot at the big-eyed opponents 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.500
 even 400 meters can light you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.730
 summing up a little on 70 first 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.200
 I want to repeat that it is still 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.270
 relevant in randomness 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.680
 Yes, according to the characteristics, it is a little worse 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 than a bulldog he has less points 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.000
 strengths below maximum speed and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.890
 drum 6 they 10 shells 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.950
 but despite this, all you can do 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.290
 on the bulldog can be turned on t71 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.200
 tank is great i like it very much and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.060
 In general, I believe that 71 is one of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.340
 best light tanks in our game 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.200
 Well, now it's time to move the fight that 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.080
 I wanted to show you because just 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.610
 now the fun begins 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.830
 cards we have winstorm as in the ninth 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.989
 release but this time rest is different but 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.090
 the battle is still with dozens of my allies 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.950
 successfully pushed green paint and now 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.110
 located in near enemy base 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.360
 about the enemy, on the contrary brought the city 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.829
 successfully did it too but instead 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.959
 to go further 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.730
 they returned to defend their base 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.700
 since the attack is reds commands 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.799
 Headed by pawns and 155 for they could 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.870
 fast enough to hang back to 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.819
 meet our heavy tanks and here 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.769
 enemy 7 decided not to return and 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.170
 continued moving towards our base 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.880
 for which he paid if you remember the first 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.739
 video from our heading then in it I 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.780
 talked about distractions and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.180
 gave an example when two heavy tanks 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.549
 stand and shoot out from behind cover 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.560
 the little firefly takes off and starts 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.600
 in every way to distract the enemy so 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.489
 Now there was exactly such a situation. 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.200
 sevens were standing and did not know that each 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.420
 a friend to make a small light tank 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.040
 flew into this mess and ruined everything 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.170
 further the situation is as follows 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.120
 way while we fumbled the seven 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.160
 little red men who stretched 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.989
 back very intelligibly explained to my 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.329
 ally what to return to defense 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.489
 bases it is an ally of all right 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.260
 understood and preferred to retire to the hangar 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.329
 the last moment when one of ours 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.670
 tyazh was still alive and opponents on him 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.410
 distracted and I managed to drive up and get 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.840
 foch and whom art has put on 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.900
 the caterpillar then left for recharge 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.660
 sadness is also in the fact that our drying is 122 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.760
 54 so hurried to the aid of a heavy tank 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.010
 I didn't notice how they all went 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.519
 in the hangar and now it is waiting for the same 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.410
 fate 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.510
 for my part I can only again 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.400
 enable rat chater mode because of the angle and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.290
 scatter your drum over opponents 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.970
 who were distracted by our pt 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.700
 in the end I managed to get 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.129
 waffleazik give three shells in e50m and 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.720
 one to send to the race after at batshat 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.579
 this had to run away from evil 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.890
 terrible isa third who for some reason 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.290
 I did not want to shoot in the meantime 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.060
 the Allied 7 arrived in time to help him 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.130
 destroy enemy artillery for what 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.410
 thank him very much and after he 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.540
 I finish the British I hoped from him 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.430
 get help with a third mustache 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.830
 but our Soviet debts decided to do 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.600
 a little differently he chased the enemy 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.790
 step that went to our 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.830
 artillery I ride in the center 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.600
 devoted the top three in the hope that 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.090
 her fly a vodan but this unfortunately 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.160
 did not happen in the end it turned out that 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.530
 tyazh each other found their own there 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.870
 disassembly near me at the center announced 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.760
 German and battshat got a long neck 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.310
 artillery in general everything was broken by 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.230
 param and everyone has their own business 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.540
 our seven problems with the tank of the eighth 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.120
 level in theory should not be me with 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.610
 E50m too much difficulty 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.440
 although he very successfully stupid me but I 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.930
 quickly fixed managed to cut 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.970
 distance and whirl it but ours 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.580
 art is really a problem therefore 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.970
 Stars and Stripes Cloak T71 to rush on 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.070
 help 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.290
 although one of our squares is already 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.150
 Unfortunately nothing can be helped but 2 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.720
 potential drowned still possible 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.450
 save 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.580
 but as it turned out later, 261 is very 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.770
 lucky at battshat and ended shells and 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.840
 He ran on Cadet incidentally beating 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.090
 ass my shells oh so this 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.740
 French armor pleases at least that 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.290
 from land mines she does not save 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.380
 Well, on this fight comes to an end I hope 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.270
 you liked him do not forget about t71 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.640
 this is a great light tank ride on 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.910
 it and carry the light in random to new 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.910
 meeting
