00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.500
 and to me that take care of me 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 hi how are you I hope you are very 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 Well, this time I bring you 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.089
 how is it that I paint the shells of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.500
 egg to then put them on the nails 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.960
 As you remember, I made a video where 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.899
 I used the painted egg shell 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.809
 of blue and some of you asked me 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.250
 that will show how it was painted 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.800
 so here I am going to show you how it is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.350
 what do I do since you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.450
 they had their eggs 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.240
 I like to leave them in the water 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.420
 to be cleaned and to make it more 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.020
 easy to detach this TV is from 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.870
 as you can see then he took away all 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.930
 the fabric inside 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.510
 and joel what is being pure 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.630
 shell 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.650
 leave me 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.840
 take them off to this 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.870
 I leave them soaking because it's made to me 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.190
 that they are off easier web 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.940
 but be it 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.350
 it's a matter of taste is true 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.210
 your 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.360
 they feel that they can be removed more 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.250
 easy so this since those who will see 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 well, it also works 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.540
 the fabric is also can be painted and 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.250
 use on the nail but it is not 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.220
 advisable to leave it in the shell 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.030
 because if not as it does not penetrate the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.000
 paint in the in the egg and they are left 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.370
 nothing more like stained but if you guys 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.250
 they want to paint it the egg fabric is 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.190
 in it they can do it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.990
 of twins 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.990
 I already have the subject remove the this 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.620
 good no more no no not left 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.440
 but if I do not all that when I leave 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.190
 soaking the eggs like that 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.720
 it's easier to take off the TV is fine 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.740
 do this 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.560
 because I have my eggshells and I will 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.650
 I want a little bit since we worry about 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.100
 tiny pieces I put him 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.990
 white vinegar and the brand that you 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.990
 want to use only be white 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.849
 I'm going to put it to fit 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.849
 covered the shells 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.080
 and I will use 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.420
 these dyes that are dye 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.420
 vegetable like for pies and things like that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.430
 then this I'm going to put some 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.620
 little piece of coloring 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.140
 you can use the coloring 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.939
 that comes liquid too I found 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.469
 these powder and it did me better because 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:38.209
 it comes well little bit apart that it does not 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:40.099
 needs so much and this as well as me nothing 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.810
 more I use them for that because I did not want 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.750
 buy because liquids are the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.400
 bigger bottles since they put it 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.530
 going to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.980
 stir well to undo the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.980
 Colorant 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.159
 not fit them any 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.709
 little group of paint because if not that is 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.810
 You can stain and leave the shell 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.220
 as the smallest dot 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.220
 more color 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.300
 since they have it there they are going to leave 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.150
 egg shell I leave it all the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.489
 night and as you can see it starts to take off 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.390
 this bubbles and then it's going to be 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.540
 like a spit but it's normal 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:29.959
 this is this is how it starts as 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.729
 penetrate in the shell 

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:35.249
 I like to tell you I like to leave it to me 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.999
 all night so that it is painted well 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:42.860
 well and here I have another stop 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:46.709
 show him this and I put it since last night 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.679
 I painted it in a red color then 

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:52.289
 I'll pass it to a colander and I'll 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.160
 wash so they see it then stop what 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.230
 I wash and go back 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.230
 well here I washed it 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.760
 that's how you can see the shell of 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.380
 egg is simply going to be here in the 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.070
 the strainer and washed it with normal water 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.730
 this one that stops you from coming out color and so is 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.170
 as it is and now I only leave it 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.170
 dry completely 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.890
 and then it is ready for the mixes not 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.980
 it gets rid of the monomer 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.010
 stain the nail or anything this remains 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.790
 perfectly painted and here I show you 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.169
 I painted one of the 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.210
 of elite again 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.910
 I can also use it in the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.410
 a 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.410
 this is how you have left 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.810
 but to me personally, I like them 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.010
 more these because they are like pieces 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.240
 then you already bruise him 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.240
 size that you want 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.080
 rather nutritious in the size that 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.330
 you want and then you're ready 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.550
 to use it in their mixtures the truth 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.500
 is that it looks nice if you have not seen 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.390
 the video where I made the design with the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.540
 egg shell here I will leave you the 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.180
 link if you like to go to see it and then 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.280
 It would be all for this video as I say 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.760
 It is very simple here I am going to show you 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.139
 keep pulling out as well as like little bubbles 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.599
 do not insert you see 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.120
 and if it gives enough the smell of vinegar 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.639
 when suddenly when at the beginning what 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.939
 They throw away but afterwards this one goes away 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.789
 going down and I as I tell you just leave it 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:47.610
 all night long that's how they start to 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:49.949
 see so that it holds the color well 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.770
 One thing I do recommend is that 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:55.590
 be powerful colors like red 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.529
 blue because I tried to paint one in 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.959
 yellow color and I'm staying 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:03.509
 a very short yellow that almost did not 

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:06.629
 I noticed then that they are very colors 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.249
 strong and these years that I use but 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:10.799
 you can use the ones that 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.799
 They sell depending on where you live 

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:16.469
 It is a plant coloring that is used 

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:18.059
 for the cakes they sell it in liquid and 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:20.039
 they sell it in powder 

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:21.989
 I buy these powder that comes 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.539
 little bit and well, actually, it's little 

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:26.609
 that is used I really hope they 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.529
 Serve this video and anything and 

00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:30.959
 you know let me lackey in the comments 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.619
 See you in the next video Nurture 

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:33.619
 see you later
