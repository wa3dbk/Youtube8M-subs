00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and that's it you've got to make five of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.819 
and that's it you've got to make five of
these<00:02:37.940> for<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> star<00:02:41.350> all<00:02:42.350> right

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
these for the star all right

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.250 
these for the star all right
then<00:02:43.579> when<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.880> put<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.329> when<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.780> piece<00:02:45.019> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
star together you put one slit through

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.220 
star together you put one slit through
this<00:02:50.090> side<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.430> side<00:02:52.630> goes<00:02:53.630> through<00:02:53.930> this

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
this side this side goes through this
