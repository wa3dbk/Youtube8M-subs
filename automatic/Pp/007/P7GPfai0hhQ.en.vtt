00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
with heat water a little agitation can

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.700 
with heat water a little agitation can
draw<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.989> figured<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

draw it out and we figured out a way to
do<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:57.440> proprietary<00:00:58.440> manner<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.820> where

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
do it in a proprietary manner to where

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.639 
do it in a proprietary manner to where
we<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> barrel<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
we can get more out of that barrel and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.020 
we can get more out of that barrel and
then<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:03.539> using<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:05.040> some<00:01:05.640> six<00:01:05.880> year

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
