taking<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.350> then<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.130> sort

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
taking that one out and then that sort

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.580 
taking that one out and then that sort
of<00:02:26.490> carried<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> next<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of carried on to the next one and the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.010 
of carried on to the next one and the
next<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.830> after<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.610> think<00:02:29.720> before<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
next one after that so I think before I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.510
