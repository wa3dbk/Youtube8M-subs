get some scrap paper and we're gonna put
onto<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.630> reverse<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.209> over<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
onto the reverse and then go over the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
onto the reverse and then go over the
tracing<00:02:10.050> again<00:02:10.319> okay<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.130> we're<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
tracing again okay so we're going to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.290 
tracing again okay so we're going to
trace<00:02:11.819> over<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.540> design<00:02:12.900> again<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:14.300> you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
trace over the design again and you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.690 
trace over the design again and you
might<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.630> noticed<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.680> design<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
might have noticed that this design is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.650 
might have noticed that this design is
actually<00:02:18.440> symmetrical<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:21.150> reason<00:02:21.510> it's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
actually symmetrical and the reason it's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.390 
actually symmetrical and the reason it's
symmetrical<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.010> choice

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
symmetrical is so that we can choice

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.610 
symmetrical is so that we can choice
this<00:02:23.640> design<00:02:24.000> from<00:02:24.239> either<00:02:24.450> side<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.200> see

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
this design from either side you see

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.820 
this design from either side you see
what<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.830> mean<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.340> minute<00:02:27.320> actually<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.709> was

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
what I mean in a minute actually I was

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.070 
what I mean in a minute actually I was
going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.190> cut<00:02:29.640> these<00:02:29.940> ends<00:02:30.300> off<00:02:30.570> as<00:02:30.780> well

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
going to just cut these ends off as well

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.560 
going to just cut these ends off as well
I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.370> gonna<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.700> much<00:02:32.910> easier<00:02:33.269> to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
I think it's gonna be much easier to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.210 
I think it's gonna be much easier to
work<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.959> room<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.769> around<00:02:34.830> the

plate okay so now let's get that right

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.400 
plate okay so now let's get that right
