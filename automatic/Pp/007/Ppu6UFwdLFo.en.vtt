00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 goalie bruno is one of a step-by-step 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 close with light mounds next to me 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.710
 We saw him, the club president. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.570
 information 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
 I saw what is missing to concretize the coming 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.599
 from the goalkeeper looks from the side of the clear hills 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.539
 we already signed the contract and he yesterday and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.490
 we sent him to his lawyer all over the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.100
 The brightest side we are waiting for Bruno 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.380
 with doors open and only depends on the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 his signature of his release from 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 beautiful horizon for him to come very odd 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 the value of hiring is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.329
 bruno is going to get some help from 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 cost in the amount of 1430 a contract of 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.360
 five years worth of a fine 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.910
 stipulated in the amount of two million 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 eight hundred and sixty so he stays 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.090
 bound to people want to give opportunity 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 a second chance with him is and and for him 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 to recover the athlete 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.859
 what was the reaction of the other athletes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.510
 the world supported because everyone deserves 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.729
 a second chance so I have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 talking to the players of the hills 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.470

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.509
 travel and training schedules 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.119
