00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 and well hello to all of you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.549
 spices and you have to go welcome in 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.600
 this new video 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.429
 so today I teach you to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.730
 speed up your computer in three 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 small steps so fast enough 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.430
 normally so we just go 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 go to the start rights menu 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 computer a year you clicked on a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.449
 computer just there you in 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.410
 hand over local disk offered property 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.490
 on top and clean the disc so 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.769
 then it will calculate 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.520
 so you're going to wait for everything 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.989
 just hanging on for the microphone so we 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 will wait a little bit and we see there 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.969
 and if you can tick a little bit 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:53.370
 you want fired and giga that it 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.020
 will you release in me I'm doing ok I 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.020
 I'm stuck so we wait a little bit 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 ok so that will also allow you to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.510
 clean up a lot of things that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.110
 can annoy you and it's on 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.180
 computer 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 it's something pretty cool I 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:20.549
 so find out then we're going all 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.070
 simply press windows + r 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:31.369
 so that will revive in running you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.369
 go and type mps config 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.460
 start and then you put to sleep 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.920
 all the programs that will light up 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.560
 while booting 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:47.120
 so that's really practical 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.200
 ok last place we will click we will 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.960
 go to the link that will register 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.540
 what was this one about 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:05.350
 ccleaner then we click on the heart 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:05.350
 we do french 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:18.730
 So here is a click that it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.340
 so installs then that's it installs 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.600
 closed up so then there was 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.300
 ccleaner it's very fast 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.810
 as you have seen and so you 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.420
 see here you can just a 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.370
 little bit clean your computer 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.360
 all that there for example you have 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.360
 clean yes and so here we will wait 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.730
 a little bit 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.680
 so I'm taking a break and we 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.020
 is found after we are a little 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.880
 your just see already I have another 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:00.400
 software to clean my computer and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.400
 I am like all that can be 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.830
 cleaned so it's really a lot I 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.830
 find 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.760
 Here halt sales record and 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.799
 if we can look for gold so we go 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.860
 wait a little bit it 'll tire 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.860
 quickly 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.489
 so here is all these 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.440
 mistakes you can light bodies 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:39.080
 like this yes yes if you can do 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.799
 a bike cup ever on the desk by 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:47.540
 example then close these few 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.709
 tools like the facilities the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.950
 startup as I showed you from 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:56.569
 this can be done with that 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.160
 was useful to me for example because we 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.569
 can not leave some software 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.319
 we can not cancel at startup 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.170
 with the coming of jose show you can 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.599
 restore the system and so on and 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.370
 eraser discs you can a 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.290
 apparently erased a disc 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.690
 so I've never tried but good if you 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.789
 want to try for yourself why 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.200
 not so that's over for this 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.669
 little video I hope she will have you 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.070
 more if it is the case a lagoon 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.350
 comment is therefore just last 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.000
 managed place to a small question oppose 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.729
 you prefer the one hula 2 so 1 2 you 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.520
 prefer a1 and a2 to no excuse me 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.120
 excuse me I was wrong 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.349
 there a hula 2 1 or 2 is between these 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.849
 which one do you prefer? 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.940
 here I am asking you and that's all the 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.940
 world
