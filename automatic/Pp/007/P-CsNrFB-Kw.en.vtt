00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
for the surf anyway i go into my

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.289 
for the surf anyway i go into my
Metagross<00:02:56.889> and<00:02:57.280> he's<00:02:57.489> going<00:02:57.669> to<00:02:57.730> switch<00:02:57.970> back

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
Metagross and he's going to switch back

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.500 
Metagross and he's going to switch back
out<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.989> his<00:02:59.040> Zapdos<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.070> i<00:03:00.400> miss<00:03:00.730> a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510

out to his Zapdos and i miss a
meteor<00:03:02.080> mash<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.890> probably<00:03:03.250> would<00:03:03.489> have

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
meteor mash and that probably would have

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.580 
meteor mash and that probably would have
taken<00:03:03.730> them<00:03:03.879> out<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.269> sucks<00:03:04.689> he<00:03:04.930> goes<00:03:05.170> for

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
switching out goes into his hair cross

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.690 
switching out goes into his hair cross
now<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:47.019> knew<00:03:47.349> he<00:03:47.530> was<00:03:47.620> choice<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.280> some<00:03:48.459> sort

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
now I knew he was choice of some sort

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.759 
now I knew he was choice of some sort
but<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:48.940> really<00:03:49.450> thought<00:03:49.659> that<00:03:49.959> he<00:03:50.200> was<00:03:50.379> on

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
but I really thought that he was on

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.970 
but I really thought that he was on
scarfed<00:03:51.579> um<00:03:51.810> but<00:03:52.810> he<00:03:53.139> goes<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.590> pursuit

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
scarfed um but he goes for a pursuit

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.099 
scarfed um but he goes for a pursuit
here<00:03:54.280> as<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.489> go<00:03:54.609> for<00:03:54.819> a<00:03:54.849> switch<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.690> know<00:03:55.840> it

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
here as I go for a switch and I know it

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.080 
here as I go for a switch and I know it
could<00:03:56.260> have<00:03:56.409> that<00:03:56.590> move<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:56.950> just<00:03:57.250> did<00:03:57.609> not<00:03:57.790> see

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
could have that move I just did not see

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.539 
could have that move I just did not see
that<00:03:58.120> coming<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:59.190> thinking<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.370> he<00:04:00.519> was

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
that coming and thinking that he was

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.460 
that coming and thinking that he was
scarfed<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.329> thought<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.900> would<00:04:02.079> be<00:04:02.109> slower

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
scarfed I thought that I would be slower

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.470 
scarfed I thought that I would be slower
anyway<00:04:02.889> so<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.220> sucks<00:04:03.549> but<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:03.909> was<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> real

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
anyway so that sucks but that was a real

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.659 
anyway so that sucks but that was a real
turning<00:04:04.720> point<00:04:04.900> for<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.409> game<00:04:05.650> because<00:04:06.250> now

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669
