00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
hot trail sled Cameron let's start out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.030 
hot trail sled Cameron let's start out
front<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> these<00:00:40.020> two<00:00:40.079> snowmobiles

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
front of these two snowmobiles

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560 
front of these two snowmobiles
what's<00:00:41.250> different<00:00:41.489> front<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.239> slope

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
what's different front of your slope

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
what's different front of your slope
obviously<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> noticed<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.160> lower

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
obviously I noticed it's a little lower

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.470 
obviously I noticed it's a little lower
but<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.670> else<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:44.969> tell<00:00:45.210> about<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
but what else can you tell about the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
but what else can you tell about the
front<00:00:45.719> huh<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> biggest<00:00:47.250> things<00:00:47.399> we

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
front huh one of the biggest things we

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
front huh one of the biggest things we
did<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.760> shim<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> front<00:00:48.300> shocks<00:00:48.710> spacer<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
did we shim the front shocks spacer in

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260 
did we shim the front shocks spacer in
there<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.280> sucks<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> front<00:00:51.030> end<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
there that sucks up the front end a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
there that sucks up the front end a
little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:51.930> lowered<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> shaft<00:00:52.590> we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
little bit so we lowered the shaft we

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
little bit so we lowered the shaft we
lowered<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> shaft<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.820> sucked<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.360> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
lowered the shaft you sucked it up a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
lowered the shaft you sucked it up a
little<00:00:54.539> bit<00:00:54.809> another<00:00:55.260> thing<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.590> did<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.399> put

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
little bit another thing I did we put

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.639 
little bit another thing I did we put
custom<00:00:57.059> spindles<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> everyone<00:00:58.440> doesn't

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
custom spindles on it everyone doesn't

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.779 
custom spindles on it everyone doesn't
have<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.219> there's<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.730> few

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
have to do it I think there's very few

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.639 
have to do it I think there's very few
right<00:01:00.180> racers<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.350> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
right racers here that do that but that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.900 
right racers here that do that but that
was<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> keep<00:01:02.460> most<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> my

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
was a way for me to keep most of my

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
was a way for me to keep most of my
shocks<00:01:03.300> still<00:01:03.629> intact

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
shocks still intact

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340 
shocks still intact
yeah<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> good<00:01:04.799> idea<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.630> sway<00:01:06.840> bar<00:01:07.080> we

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
yeah that's a good idea the sway bar we

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
yeah that's a good idea the sway bar we
left<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.189> racers<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.640> rid<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
left that in some racers get rid of it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.190 
left that in some racers get rid of it
but<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:09.869> taking<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
but in this when you're taking the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
but in this when you're taking the
corners<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.010> helps<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.670> make

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
corners like that it helps out to make

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.490 
corners like that it helps out to make
sure<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> keep<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.570> sway<00:01:12.780> bar<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
sure that you keep that sway bar in to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
sure that you keep that sway bar in to
pick<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.070> inside<00:01:14.460> ski<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> same<00:01:15.090> time

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
pick up that inside ski at the same time

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
pick up that inside ski at the same time
the<00:01:15.420> outside<00:01:15.720> ski<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> pushing<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.470> camera<00:01:17.220> one

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the outside ski is pushing up camera one

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
the outside ski is pushing up camera one
other<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.670> I've<00:01:17.820> noticed<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.450> slider

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.949 
for you on this sled I mean as far as it
looks<00:03:08.579> like<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> pretty<00:03:09.030> comfortable<00:03:09.540> position

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
looks like a pretty comfortable position

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.009 
looks like a pretty comfortable position
yep<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.579> almost<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> saddle<00:03:12.389> we<00:03:12.540> took<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
yep it's almost like a saddle we took a

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.800 
yep it's almost like a saddle we took a
little<00:03:13.109> out<00:03:13.590> yeah<00:03:14.299> going<00:03:15.299> on<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> streets

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
little out yeah going on the streets

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.629 
little out yeah going on the streets
most<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.590> time<00:03:16.799> your<00:03:17.010> hand<00:03:17.159> isn't<00:03:17.310> even<00:03:17.579> up

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
most of the time your hand isn't even up

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.069 
most of the time your hand isn't even up
here<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:18.090> did<00:03:18.239> put<00:03:18.419> something<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.870> block

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
here we did put something here to block

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.140 
here we did put something here to block
the<00:03:19.260> wind<00:03:19.379> it's<00:03:20.040> all<00:03:20.190> about<00:03:20.400> rider<00:03:20.639> comfort<00:03:20.910> if

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the wind it's all about rider comfort if

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.309 
the wind it's all about rider comfort if
you<00:03:21.239> don't<00:03:21.389> have<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.540> tall<00:03:21.750> windshield<00:03:22.169> on

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319

you don't have a tall windshield on
these<00:03:22.500> sleds<00:03:22.799> your<00:03:23.699> head<00:03:23.879> blows<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:24.359> over

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
these sleds your head blows all over

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.390 
these sleds your head blows all over
you've<00:03:25.319> all<00:03:25.440> probably<00:03:25.650> done<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:25.949> at<00:03:26.220> home

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you've all probably done that at home

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.920 
you've all probably done that at home
but<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:27.180> make<00:03:27.359> sure<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.629> point<00:03:27.750> isn't

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
but we make sure the point isn't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.610 
but we make sure the point isn't
touching<00:03:28.199> us

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
touching us

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.559 
touching us
most<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> time<00:03:29.519> we're<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.299> streets

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
most the time we're going on the streets

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.970 
most the time we're going on the streets
your<00:03:30.720> hands<00:03:30.900> either<00:03:31.109> back<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.680> stay<00:03:31.859> out

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
your hands either back here to stay out

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.589 
your hands either back here to stay out
of<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.160> wind<00:03:32.310> or<00:03:32.609> it's<00:03:32.819> in<00:03:32.940> your<00:03:33.060> lap<00:03:33.209> or<00:03:33.510> it's

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
of the wind or it's in your lap or it's

behind your leg to keep warm

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.069 
behind your leg to keep warm
cuz<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:35.879> such<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.090> long<00:03:36.329> race<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:39.540> know<00:03:39.629> the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
cuz it's such a long race you know the

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.199 
cuz it's such a long race you know the
other<00:03:40.230> thing<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.769> key<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.669> if<00:03:42.090> I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
other thing that's key to this and if I

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.400 
other thing that's key to this and if I

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
could get the camera to come in a little

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.129 
could get the camera to come in a little
bit<00:03:43.560> when<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.280> make<00:03:44.459> driver<00:03:44.879> changes<00:03:45.419> when
