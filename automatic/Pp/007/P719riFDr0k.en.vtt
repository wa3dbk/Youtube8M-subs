I missed you loading this one starts off

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040 
I missed you loading this one starts off
with<00:00:28.789> one<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> puzzle<00:00:30.390> wheels

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
with one of the puzzle wheels

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200 
with one of the puzzle wheels
like<00:00:31.859> we've<00:00:32.219> done<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.489> quite<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> few<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
like we've done in quite a few of the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.680 
like we've done in quite a few of the
other<00:00:33.329> ones<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> trick<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
other ones so trick to this one is you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
other ones so trick to this one is you
go<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> way<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> fourth<00:00:41.040> ring<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
go all the way up to the fourth ring and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
go all the way up to the fourth ring and
rotate<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:43.879> five<00:00:44.879> times<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.410> one

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
rotate it five times to the right so one

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.040 
rotate it five times to the right so one
two<00:00:47.250> three<00:00:47.730> four<00:00:48.270> five<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
two three four five and then you go to

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760 
two three four five and then you go to
the<00:00:52.050> first<00:00:52.469> string<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:54.500> twice<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the first string and go twice to the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
the first string and go twice to the
right<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.940> twice<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.879> then<00:00:59.879> go<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
right so one twice and then go up to the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.399 
right so one twice and then go up to the
second<00:01:01.079> ring<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:02.870> twice<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> right

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
second ring and go twice to the right

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.060 
second ring and go twice to the right
once<00:01:05.070> twice<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.409> there<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:09.290> loading

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.330 

reasoning<00:01:14.070> centers<00:01:14.369> octave<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> next

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
reasoning centers octave and the next

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.999 
reasoning centers octave and the next
part<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:18.000> another<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> those

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
part you get another one of those

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
part you get another one of those
picture<00:01:20.009> ones<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> take<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
picture ones where you have to take a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.980 
picture ones where you have to take a
bunch<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> pictures<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> group

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
bunch of pictures out of the group

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.950 
bunch of pictures out of the group
basically<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> hint<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
basically the the hint on it is a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.170 
basically the the hint on it is a
product<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:29.070> without<00:01:29.460> hands<00:01:30.090> or

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
product that we make without hands or

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
product that we make without hands or
machines<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:30.990> talking<00:01:31.259> about<00:01:31.380> kids

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
machines so they're talking about kids

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.249 
machines so they're talking about kids
so<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> look<00:01:33.150> through<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.479> pictures<00:01:33.930> any

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so if you look through the pictures any

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.800 
so if you look through the pictures any
of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> ones<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> kids<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.859 

France<00:01:40.729> New<00:01:41.729> York<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.380> and

France New York that one this one and
that<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:51.630> not

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.990 

there<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.800> go<00:02:04.920> sorry<00:02:05.220> it's<00:02:05.400> not<00:02:05.610> New<00:02:05.850> York

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
there you go sorry it's not New York

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.310 
there you go sorry it's not New York
it's<00:02:06.380> France<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.740> other<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.930> about

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
it's France and the other one it's about

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's France and the other one it's about
genetics<00:02:14.100> they<00:02:14.700> were<00:02:14.760> born<00:02:15.210> into<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.660> place

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
genetics they were born into that place

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.420 
genetics they were born into that place
now<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.410> another<00:02:16.650> part<00:02:17.040> where<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.310> have

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
now we have another part where you have

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.210 
now we have another part where you have
to<00:02:17.730> zoom<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.350> find<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.870> special<00:02:21.870> code<00:02:22.440> if

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to zoom in and find the special code if

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.820 
to zoom in and find the special code if
you<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.850> top<00:02:24.150> picture<00:02:24.630> see<00:02:25.620> there's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you go to the top picture see there's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.520 
you go to the top picture see there's
actually<00:02:26.070> an<00:02:26.610> eagle<00:02:27.120> flying<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> sky<00:02:28.170> so

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
actually an eagle flying in the sky so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
actually an eagle flying in the sky so
that's<00:02:28.710> actually<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.160> code<00:02:29.490> there<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.150> you'd

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that's actually the code there so you'd

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's actually the code there so you'd
select<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.100> another<00:02:32.370> code

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
select that and you get another code

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
select that and you get another code
wheel<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.680> time<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.700> pattern<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.240> I

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
wheel this time the pattern really I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.260 
wheel this time the pattern really I
couldn't<00:02:37.380> figure<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.240> managed<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
couldn't figure it out I just managed to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.800 
couldn't figure it out I just managed to
guess<00:02:39.690> kind<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.490> actual<00:02:41.490> code<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.150> two<00:02:42.660> of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
guess kind of the actual code so two of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.360 
guess kind of the actual code so two of
the<00:02:42.870> numbers<00:02:43.170> will<00:02:43.380> match<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.590> properly<00:02:44.190> in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the numbers will match up properly in

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.570 
the numbers will match up properly in
the<00:02:44.460> other<00:02:44.580> two<00:02:45.500> yeah<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.280> said<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.490> just

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
the other two yeah as I said I just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:58.360 
the other two yeah as I said I just
guessed<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:52.250> 88<00:02:53.250> for<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.940> first<00:02:54.390> one

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.980 
loading I shut it down I can shut it
loading<00:04:51.150> warranties<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.479> then<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.810> last

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
loading warranties and then the last

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.010 
loading warranties and then the last
part<00:04:53.289> on<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.710> is<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.099> quarantine<00:04:54.490> which<00:04:55.419> if

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
part on it is the quarantine which if

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.010 
part on it is the quarantine which if
you<00:04:56.229> pre<00:04:56.710> look<00:04:56.919> there<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.580> now<00:04:57.849> a<00:04:58.330> ton<00:04:58.750> of<00:04:58.780> them

and basically it goes in the shape of a
spiral<00:05:01.690> all<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.889> way<00:05:02.979> around

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.409 

-<00:05:08.020> they're<00:05:08.229> so<00:05:08.650> easiest<00:05:09.580> way<00:05:09.699> to<00:05:09.729> start<00:05:10.030> at<00:05:10.330> the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
- they're so easiest way to start at the

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.719 
- they're so easiest way to start at the
very<00:05:10.449> end<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.139> just<00:05:11.199> keep<00:05:11.560> pushing<00:05:11.949> circle<00:05:12.460> as

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
very end and just keep pushing circle as

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.200 
very end and just keep pushing circle as
you<00:05:13.409> go<00:05:14.409> up<00:05:14.800> make<00:05:15.190> sure<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.550> don't<00:05:15.580> miss<00:05:16.000> any
