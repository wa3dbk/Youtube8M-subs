absolutely amazing and we're not really

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.760 
absolutely amazing and we're not really
big<00:02:50.120> zombie<00:02:50.420> players<00:02:50.810> but<00:02:51.020> there<00:02:51.170> see<00:02:51.560> you

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
big zombie players but there see you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.800 
big zombie players but there see you
activate<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.030> two<00:02:53.270> out<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.450> six

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
activate it and that is two out of six

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.810 
activate it and that is two out of six
and<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.350> kind<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.800> stay<00:02:55.100> there<00:02:55.280> for<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
and you kind of have to stay there for a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.510 
and you kind of have to stay there for a
little<00:02:56.150> bit<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:57.170> capture<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.250> seems

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
little bit to capture it and it seems

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.760 
little bit to capture it and it seems
like<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.060> goes<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> lot<00:02:59.480> faster<00:02:59.930> when<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.590> have

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
like it goes a lot faster when you have

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.520 
like it goes a lot faster when you have
a<00:03:00.800> group<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.310> people<00:03:01.459> around<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.810> also<00:03:03.230> I

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
a group of people around and also I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.250 
a group of people around and also I
noticed<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:05.030> third<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.780> fourth

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
noticed that and the third and fourth

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.680 
noticed that and the third and fourth
capture<00:03:06.950> station<00:03:07.250> these<00:03:08.000> zombies<00:03:08.450> got<00:03:08.660> a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
capture station these zombies got a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.210 
capture station these zombies got a
little<00:03:09.080> bit<00:03:09.170> more<00:03:09.440> harder<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:09.890> maybe<00:03:10.040> that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
little bit more harder and maybe that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.550 
little bit more harder and maybe that
was<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:10.519> because<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.150> progressed<00:03:11.930> rounds<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
was just because we progressed rounds a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.050 
was just because we progressed rounds a
little<00:03:12.769> bit<00:03:12.860> but<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.340> seemed<00:03:13.610> like<00:03:13.790> there<00:03:13.970> was

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
little bit but it seemed like there was

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.729 
little bit but it seemed like there was
a<00:03:14.120> lot<00:03:14.330> more<00:03:14.390> zombies<00:03:15.200> coming<00:03:15.440> there's<00:03:15.680> a

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
and I don't know if it was the best plan

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.920 
and I don't know if it was the best plan
in<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.100> world<00:03:40.190> we're<00:03:40.610> kind<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.000> noobish<00:03:41.690> at

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
in the world we're kind of noobish at

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.020 
in the world we're kind of noobish at
this<00:03:42.110> point<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:42.650> didn't<00:03:42.920> really<00:03:43.250> explore<00:03:43.700> I

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
think at this specific time this was the

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.470 
think at this specific time this was the
