00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.620 
with morale at the end it was a split
decision<00:02:01.799> 115<00:02:02.790> 115<00:02:03.829> 115-113<00:02:05.000> 115-113<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
decision 115 115 115-113 115-113 and the

it<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.730> 116-112

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
it was 116-112

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.980

motor came out in the first couple
rounds<00:03:57.230> very<00:03:57.920> active<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:58.580> then<00:03:58.730> got<00:03:58.880> tired<00:03:59.120> or

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420

whatever and penalosa got him in the
last<00:04:01.640> couple<00:04:01.880> rounds<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.420> know<00:04:02.540> we<00:04:02.750> would

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
last couple rounds you know we would

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.570 
last couple rounds you know we would
have<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.140> count<00:04:03.320> round<00:04:03.680> by<00:04:03.799> round<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.250> see<00:04:04.370> but

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
have to count round by round and see but

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.020 
have to count round by round and see but
obviously<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:06.140> 116<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.890> 112<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.730> doesn't<00:04:07.970> even

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
obviously the 116 to 112 it doesn't even

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.500 
obviously the 116 to 112 it doesn't even
make<00:04:08.269> sense<00:04:08.330> when<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:08.959> have<00:04:09.170> two<00:04:09.500> cars<00:04:09.830> at<00:04:10.160> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
make sense when you have two cars at a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.170 
make sense when you have two cars at a
115-113<00:04:11.799> 115-113<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:12.980> then<00:04:13.370> some<00:04:13.549> idiot<00:04:13.760> pig

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
115-113 115-113 and then some idiot pig

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.009 
115-113 115-113 and then some idiot pig
judge<00:04:14.510> comes<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.440> gives<00:04:15.580> 116-112<00:04:16.580> so<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:17.780> was

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
judge comes and gives 116-112 so it was

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.070 
judge comes and gives 116-112 so it was
like<00:04:18.200> one<00:04:18.859> of<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.040> judges<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:20.150> 116<00:04:20.690> was<00:04:20.840> 12

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
like one of the judges the 116 was 12

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.630 
like one of the judges the 116 was 12
112<00:04:21.500> was<00:04:21.620> watching<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.039> whole<00:04:22.190> different<00:04:22.520> fight

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
112 was watching a whole different fight

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.760 
112 was watching a whole different fight
so<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.360> agree<00:04:23.840> with<00:04:23.870> that<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.470> it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
so I agree with that and it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.520 
so I agree with that and it
so<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.669> know<00:04:25.840> if<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.960> lot<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.139> people<00:04:27.229> thought

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
so you know if a lot of people thought

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.050 
so you know if a lot of people thought
