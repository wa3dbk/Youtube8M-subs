I don't look too happy today there is a
reason<00:00:07.890> I'm<00:00:08.760> really<00:00:09.120> bummed<00:00:09.480> out<00:00:10.070> I'm<00:00:11.070> sitting

reason I'm really bummed out I'm sitting

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.419 
reason I'm really bummed out I'm sitting
here<00:00:11.759> looking<00:00:12.000> at<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.690> puddle<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.559> fluid<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
here looking at a puddle of fluid on the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.740 
here looking at a puddle of fluid on the
floor<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.330> upon<00:00:15.960> closer<00:00:16.379> inspection<00:00:16.770> I

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
floor here and upon closer inspection I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.200 
floor here and upon closer inspection I
notice<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.080> red<00:00:19.400> yes<00:00:20.400> that's<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
notice that it's red yes that's right a

about<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.449> weeks<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.099> have<00:00:29.099> finally

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
about two weeks and have finally

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.319 
about two weeks and have finally
narrowed<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.269> down<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.470> last<00:00:31.740> leak<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329

to<00:00:40.710> fix<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.640> prominent<00:00:42.149> leak<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> see

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to fix the prominent leak that you see

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
to fix the prominent leak that you see
here<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> first<00:00:44.190> purchased<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.820> car<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
here when I first purchased this car a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
here when I first purchased this car a
couple<00:00:45.239> months<00:00:45.539> ago<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.989> knew<00:00:46.289> there<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
couple months ago I knew there was a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
couple months ago I knew there was a
transmission<00:00:47.460> fluid<00:00:47.940> leak<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.239> could<00:00:48.510> tell<00:00:48.690> by

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
transmission fluid leak I could tell by

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
transmission fluid leak I could tell by
looking<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.410> both<00:00:49.800> sides<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> belly<00:00:50.730> pan

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
looking down both sides of the belly pan

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
looking down both sides of the belly pan
they<00:00:51.989> were<00:00:52.050> very<00:00:52.379> wet<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> wetness

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
they were very wet and the wetness

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.209 
they were very wet and the wetness
indicated<00:00:54.239> transmission<00:00:54.809> fluid<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.710> engine

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
indicated transmission fluid not engine

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
indicated transmission fluid not engine
oil<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:57.180> hoping<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> leak<00:00:57.780> would<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
oil I was hoping the leak would be a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
oil I was hoping the leak would be a
real<00:00:58.410> big<00:00:58.770> problem<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> went<00:00:59.879> ahead<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
real big problem so I went ahead and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.470 
real big problem so I went ahead and
removed<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.079> belly<00:01:01.350> pan<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.329> there<00:01:03.329> was

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
removed the belly pan here and there was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.350 
removed the belly pan here and there was
so<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:04.199> oil<00:01:04.820> fluid<00:01:05.820> around<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so much oil fluid around the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660 
so much oil fluid around the
transmission<00:01:07.080> area<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.799> could<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.250> tell

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
transmission area that I could not tell

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
transmission area that I could not tell
initially<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> leak<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:09.930> coming<00:01:10.260> from

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
initially where the leak was coming from

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.280 
initially where the leak was coming from
so<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> narrow<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.780> started

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so to kind of narrow it down I started

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.010 
so to kind of narrow it down I started
by<00:01:13.439> removing<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.040> pan<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:15.000> enough<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.450> found

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
by removing the pan sure enough I found

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.730 
by removing the pan sure enough I found
out<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> pan<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.820> bent<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.350> gasket

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
out that the pan was bent and the gasket

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
out that the pan was bent and the gasket
was<00:01:20.100> cut<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.670> went<00:01:20.880> ahead<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
was cut and I went ahead and and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
was cut and I went ahead and and
straightened<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> pan<00:01:23.700> lip<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
straightened out the pan lip and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.560 
straightened out the pan lip and
installed<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.780> new<00:01:24.900> gasket<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.470> filter<00:01:26.570> then

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
installed a new gasket and filter then

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.780 
installed a new gasket and filter then
drove<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> car<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.530> sure<00:01:28.829> enough<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.310> leak

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
drove the car and sure enough a leak

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
drove the car and sure enough a leak
persisted<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.290> point<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.799> went<00:01:32.009> ahead<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
persisted at that point I went ahead and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
persisted at that point I went ahead and
went<00:01:32.729> after<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> second<00:01:33.540> most<00:01:33.659> common<00:01:33.780> leak

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
went after the second most common leak

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
went after the second most common leak
on<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.710> things<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
on these things and that's from the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.330 
on these things and that's from the
transmission<00:01:36.479> fill<00:01:37.020> tube<00:01:37.320> located<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
transmission fill tube located on the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
transmission fill tube located on the
front<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.930> side<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> transmission

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
front right side of the transmission

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
front right side of the transmission
that<00:01:41.189> required<00:01:41.579> removing<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> tube<00:01:42.450> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that required removing the tube in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
that required removing the tube in
installing<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.380> new<00:01:43.619> o-ring<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.220> even<00:01:44.820> after

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
installing a new o-ring and even after

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.350 
installing a new o-ring and even after
doing<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:47.070> transmission<00:01:48.060> leak

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
doing that the transmission leak

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
doing that the transmission leak
persisted<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.079> upon<00:01:50.040> further<00:01:50.340> inspection

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
persisted and upon further inspection

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
persisted and upon further inspection
after<00:01:52.380> cleaning<00:01:52.740> everything<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.790> could<00:01:54.450> see

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
after cleaning everything I could see

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.170 
after cleaning everything I could see
that<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> primary<00:01:55.649> leak<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.340> coming<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.939> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that the primary leak was coming out of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.749 
that the primary leak was coming out of
the<00:01:57.570> bell<00:01:57.719> housing<00:01:58.280> that's<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> got

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the bell housing that's when I got

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
the bell housing that's when I got
really<00:01:59.820> bummed<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.450> because<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.259> means<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
really bummed out because that means the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
really bummed out because that means the
transmission<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> be

oh<00:02:56.790> ring<00:02:57.240> on<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:58.290> fill<00:02:58.500> tube<00:02:58.710> this<00:02:58.890> is

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
oh ring on the fill tube this is

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.370 
oh ring on the fill tube this is
becoming<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.670> very<00:02:59.700> common<00:03:00.420> problem<00:03:00.600> as<00:03:00.900> these

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
becoming a very common problem as these

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.690 
becoming a very common problem as these
o-rings<00:03:01.680> age<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.850> harden<00:03:03.330> over<00:03:03.630> time<00:03:03.900> and

o-rings age and harden over time and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.880 
o-rings age and harden over time and
finally<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.210> looks<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> have

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
finally it looks like I'm going to have

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.400 
finally it looks like I'm going to have
to<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.280> another<00:03:09.210> instruction<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.170> know<00:03:10.200> they

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
to do another instruction you know they

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.680 
to do another instruction you know they
say<00:03:10.620> there's<00:03:10.830> opportunity<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.760> every<00:03:12.090> problem

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
say there's opportunity in every problem

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.200 
say there's opportunity in every problem
and<00:03:12.780> sure<00:03:13.650> enough<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.340> transmission<00:03:15.090> is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
and sure enough this transmission is

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.910 
and sure enough this transmission is
going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> come<00:03:16.020> out<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.440> go<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.710> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
going to have to come out and go on the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.610 
going to have to come out and go on the
bench<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.400> I'm<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.350> replace

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
