00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.860
 Hi girls, I do not have any voice because 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 malite state of the throat and I'm a 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.670
 little hoarse but I wanted to record this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 video but I have pending since it has 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 started to record again because I have 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.140
 illusion of making the revive that I want 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.240
 make a product and that is from a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.660
 liquid to kylie as ' number without odor 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.970
 what is this 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:45.050
 rn 6 is called spawn of the liquid as you see 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.680
 har homa they put the good utility I 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.809
 I started that I bought this one that has 118 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.930
 3 milliliters is a tiny little bottle 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.120
 I bought it to try because the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
 organism does not bother me moment I do not have 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.500
 an allergy nor do I have any problems in 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 general but it bothered me a lot and I 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.129
 bothers a lot for example being in the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.280
 kitchen making my nails are in the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.660
 salon doing my nails and that I 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.060
 I always do them at night that the 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.950
 next day someone comes and I continue 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.469
 Watching 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.539
 I love I do not see acrylic units 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.280
 it bothers me a lot I understand that the salons 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.409
 of beauty or those that you dedicate to this 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.299
 you will have with the dedicated area 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.880
 just to this and it may be fine 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.100
 thrown away I make them home then I do not 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.509
 I have no ventilation I can 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.250
 open the windows but it's not the same 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.189
 it seems that I get the impression that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.130
 it stays embedded everywhere 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.159
 then buy then I am always 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.780
 I have used so far the number of 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.140
 under the order that I love and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.259
 back to buy I'm waiting for it 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.590
 receive it because I have very little 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:55.340
 but then I wanted to buy a 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.289
 number without any smell it then you 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.750
 I wanted to tell you what I think about stability 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.000
 He has bought me for not having 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.770
 I love that it does not really smell like it does not 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.319
 good and smell for example like 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.970
 any nail product let's say how 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.640
 for example the normal nail polish remover that 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.040
 It has a characteristic smell but it is not 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.500
 the strong smell and I know it stays in all 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.470
 the house then is a mild smell 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.960
 It's not unpleasant and it's easy 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.850
 work with him what is the problem that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.690
 have I see you have a very drying 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.200
 slow if you have worked with monomer 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.030
 under the order of you have seen that it 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.830
 changes but in which one will be chosen 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.140
 memory card we have to change it 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.200
 Well, you said you have worked 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.910
 with the number below smell you have 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.580
 seen that it dries a bit slower but 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.050
 it's not exaggerated, because this is 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.270
 exaggerated me that I always do the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.950
 nail cultual forms you know it is 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.590
 quite uncomfortable to have to be 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.380
 waiting a lot of time to deserve 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.510
 It's worth it, I do not know, it 's fine for a 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.060
 side has the advantage of the smell but for 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.220
 The other side is the nice drying 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.570
 for example with the waffles we have 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.160
 risks they create a lot of 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.450
 bubbles because it has not been there has not 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 come to dry then when you 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.709
 you apply which was an envelope on the nail 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.530
 you tighten as it is not dried why 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.870
 it takes so long if you create bubbles 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.670
 and well, what does that mean? 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.170
 much more in making yourself the set of ones 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.540
 because you have to be waiting for 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.100
 I know that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.780
 then nothing, I'm going to tell you what 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.400
 I bought by ebay 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.530
 I do not remember the price but it was not 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.390
 Excessively expensive if you want to try it 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.819
 Well, it's not bad, but like all 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.050
 table products and it's very good but 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.380
 It's worth knowing that drying is 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.930
 too slow if you have no hurry in 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.180
 presenter I know that I recommend them and if 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.790
 no better then a monomer under it the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.860
 average monkey of always of the whole life 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.069
 I hope you enjoyed listening to me 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.670
 opinion and nothing we see as always in 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.670
 another video
