00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 Hello everyone and it's been nine 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.959
 more than a month that apple has launched his 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.359
 own music streaming service 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.740
 soberly named apple music there is 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.880
 good and a lot of my good we talk about it 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.530
 today the launch of such 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.030
 service was to be expected after the takeover 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.320
 from the beats brand we could only go 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 wait when this service has been 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.529
 presented at a numerous keynote 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.910
 were the people who said that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.439
 remains a streaming service guys 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.789
 it's not because it's apple 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.109
 must revolutionize a market as soon as 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.369
 that they put their foot in it more without the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.199
 want to make you a compliment the apple 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.939
 and even if she can even say that this 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.080
 will be revolutionary it is not necessary at all 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.250
 take into account it's my all the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.929
 amazing etc 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 we forget in California it's like 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.690
 say hello so yes in principle 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.190
 it's still a streaming service 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.690
 I did not revolutionize the videos on 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.050
 youtube so why are you watching from 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.489
 based 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
 we must not wait for music 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.340
 upset the market but that there 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 brings his touch even in writing 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 is on the same rates as six 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.059
 competitors 10 euros a month but 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 only 15 euros for a family of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.850
 six people that's new to a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 time that apples rubs the price of its 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 comrades proposes that we applaud him in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.480
 the more service is available on 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 android 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.329
 all this with a very long trial period 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.739
 interesting three months it's a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.329
 pretty amazing figure usually the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 Function tests 30 days and after it takes 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 take a subscription 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.289
 but apple sees the thing differently and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 he sees just for two reasons the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.960
 first is to boost the numbers 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.430
 there would definitely be a conference 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 and September so at the end of this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 trial period I see it perfectly tim 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.350
 cook corner of his friends landed on 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.909
 scene and announce numbers that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.619
 explode all its competitors while 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.970
 no one has paid the world yet attracts 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.290
 the world and that you can see that we 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.759
 wanted to initially ice at the edge of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.229
 beach there will always be the trade 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.640
 connected to the tail and the one opposite where 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.140
 people announced 20 million 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.549
 random users from the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 launch and see the figure climbs to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.500
 the second reason may not be 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 wanted the apple 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.200
 but that's where I saw that three months 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.939
 it's necessary apple music is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.799
 ambitious has good ideas big 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.450
 means an already huge catalog but 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.840
 as said in type of this video there is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.490
 a snag 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.439
 i love apple music but i hate it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 I want to love it for the musical side I 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.869
 hate him for far too much 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.610
 and that I followed them first 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.540
 seconds of use cgem apple that's 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.549
 first and foremost for his mastery of the software 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.799
 his ability to render tasks 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 complicated simple and nice so much in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.140
 use that for the eyes then 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.670
 what is this shit y'a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 full in English we do not know what it is 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.570
 corresponds why a tab my music 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.829
 is another playlist why is it so 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.630
 complicated to add a title to a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.070
 playlist on mac why let's put 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.270
 so much time to get started why the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.560
 thematic playlists are in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.969
 novelties why there is no 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.960
 playlists work while there is to 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.210
 barbeque barbecue french people 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.950
 barbecue electric barbecue fricassee 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.360
 there's something for everyone connect 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.650
 who is supposed to link the artists with 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.910
 their fans I'm not sure that's it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.230
 works very long and then that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.030
 does that add a tab this 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.530
 interface already fled from the first 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.209
 seconds I knew that I hated the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.590
 service and after a month it still has 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.180
 not changed but I love apple music 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.190
 it's gold because pittsburgh is the only one 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.540
 radio that I like to listen without ads with 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.770
 good sound for all tastes and 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.209
 personalities who are gods in 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.470
 their domain I do not know what to turn 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.270
 these ricains but it sends wood 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.040
 golden game for his understanding of 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.810
 musical interests the user from your tone 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.130
 arrival is apple all spit they 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.930
 take you by the hand asks you to 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.489
 select taylor favorite artists 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.170
 to gradually perfect the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.640
 section for you and today with the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.260
 radio it's the only two tab that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.709
 I use on service his playlists are 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.790
 short 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.140
 it is extremely well done and with 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.160
 searched themes that I did not 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.209
 not find anywhere else it's very 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.190
 inspiring for musical knowledge 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.810
 you will discover or rediscover 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.730
 artists and titles and I do not know 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.170
 if it's specific to rap r'n'b style that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.850
 I listen a lot but it's for me 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.050
 the highlight of apple music is a 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.280
 service that is done by people who 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.630
 love the music that live 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.860
 but that's also his problem for me 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.630
 it's not apple that created the service 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.160
 it's a team of beats that tried 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.750
 to do something with a mold of 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.950
 what apple is already doing but the problem 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.630
 it does not work I do not think 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.340
 that johnny had the slightest idea 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.540
 put on some music and I hope 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.680
 that these three months will be sufficient 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.220
 to improve the service this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.630
 interface 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.980
 because there is real potential and 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.480
 I would like to leave spotify for 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.220
 join apple music at the end of the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.150
 trial period apple sato kv and that's it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.739
 you know now in my opinion 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.209
 on apple music tell me what you 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.840
 think about it in the comments the good ones 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.700
 and bad points 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.230
 the service you use and why 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 remember to like the video if it is 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.079
 there is subscribe to my channel because of 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.880
 anyway during the holidays well 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.299
 nothing else to do thanks to all these 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.299
 glass bikes 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.120
 oh damn i'm handsome announcing boring 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.120
 in
