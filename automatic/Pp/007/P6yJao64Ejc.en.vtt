if you look right above the engine here

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.539 
if you look right above the engine here
there's<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.900> hose<00:03:14.440> coming<00:03:14.890> out<00:03:15.099> or<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> pipe<00:03:15.519> that

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
there's a hose coming out or a pipe that

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.729 
there's a hose coming out or a pipe that
would<00:03:15.970> be<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.239> output<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.019> starting<00:03:17.440> fan

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
would be the output for the starting fan

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.780 
would be the output for the starting fan
and<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:20.079> input<00:03:20.909> comes<00:03:21.909> up<00:03:22.150> off<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.420> here

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and the input comes up off of here

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.550 
and the input comes up off of here
there's<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.909> valve<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:25.810> control<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.379> whether

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
there's a valve to control it whether

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.300 
there's a valve to control it whether
it's<00:03:26.769> flowing<00:03:27.670> or<00:03:27.790> not<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.560> input<00:03:30.069> there

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
it's flowing or not so that input there

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.369 
it's flowing or not so that input there
comes<00:03:30.879> out<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:33.690> then<00:03:34.690> we're<00:03:34.870> off<00:03:35.019> into<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
comes out there then we're off into the

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.130 
comes out there then we're off into the
cooler<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.730> blow<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.420> there's<00:03:40.660> an<00:03:40.780> electric

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
cooler and blow that there's an electric

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:49.130 
cooler and blow that there's an electric
motor<00:03:41.349> I<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:44.049> run<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.409> saw<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:45.069> that<00:03:46.500> or<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> can

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
motor I can run the saw of that or I can

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.410 
motor I can run the saw of that or I can
also<00:03:50.140> i<00:03:50.500> can<00:03:50.620> run<00:03:50.980> use<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.609> as<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> flywheel

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
also i can run use that as a flywheel

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.979 
also i can run use that as a flywheel
and<00:03:54.659> use<00:03:55.659> the<00:03:55.900> engine<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:57.760> run<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.090> saw<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.659> i

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
and use the engine to run the saw and i

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.690 
and use the engine to run the saw and i
can<00:03:59.140> also<00:03:59.290> make<00:03:59.590> electricity<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.459> motor

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
can also make electricity of that motor

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.229 
can also make electricity of that motor
if<00:04:00.909> i<00:04:01.000> put<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.299> right<00:04:01.450> captain<00:04:01.930> line<00:04:02.139> with<00:04:02.319> it

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
if i put the right captain line with it

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.199 
if i put the right captain line with it
well<00:04:04.239> there's<00:04:04.419> your<00:04:04.540> cooler<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:08.459> little<00:04:09.459> jump

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
well there's your cooler a little jump

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.690 
well there's your cooler a little jump
back<00:04:10.450> up<00:04:10.660> air<00:04:11.410> cleaner<00:04:11.739> here<00:04:14.430> there's<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.519> big

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
back up air cleaner here there's a big

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.460 
back up air cleaner here there's a big
truck<00:04:15.910> filter<00:04:16.359> in<00:04:16.450> there<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:16.900> i<00:04:16.959> don't

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
truck filter in there so i don't

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.900 
truck filter in there so i don't
generally<00:04:18.039> have<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.190> lot<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.459> problem<00:04:18.849> with

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
generally have a lot of problem with

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.330 
generally have a lot of problem with
capacity<00:04:19.570> that's<00:04:20.250> way<00:04:21.250> over<00:04:21.280> done<00:04:23.310> ok<00:04:26.340> there's

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
capacity that's way over done ok there's

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.050 
capacity that's way over done ok there's
the<00:04:28.680> well<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.310> figure<00:04:30.580> out<00:04:30.699> what<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.910> call

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
the well you figure out what to call

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.650 
the well you figure out what to call
that<00:04:32.550> all<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.669> tops<00:04:33.940> them<00:04:34.150> lit<00:04:34.360> up<00:04:34.479> with<00:04:34.599> a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
that all the tops them lit up with a

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.850 
that all the tops them lit up with a
little<00:04:34.990> bit<00:04:35.110> here<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.380> next<00:04:35.530> video

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
little bit here in the next video

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.560 
little bit here in the next video
probably

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.820 

yeah<00:04:42.570> it's<00:04:42.750> definitely<00:04:42.930> not<00:04:43.199> for<00:04:43.470> those<00:04:43.590> with

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
yeah it's definitely not for those with

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.770 
yeah it's definitely not for those with
the<00:04:43.919> faint<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.280> heart<00:04:44.460> or<00:04:44.699> don't<00:04:45.240> understand

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
the faint of heart or don't understand

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.210 
the faint of heart or don't understand
things<00:04:46.620> yeah<00:04:47.479> you<00:04:48.479> definitely<00:04:48.979> have<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.100> be

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
things yeah you definitely have to be

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.550 
things yeah you definitely have to be
careful<00:04:50.580> with<00:04:50.699> that<00:04:51.050> must<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.199> course<00:04:52.410> you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
careful with that must of course you

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.640 
careful with that must of course you
want<00:04:52.770> too<00:04:52.860> much<00:04:52.949> i'm<00:04:53.130> missing<00:04:53.490> digits<00:04:54.650> well

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
want too much i'm missing digits well

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.870 
want too much i'm missing digits well
there's<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.979> other<00:04:56.070> side<00:04:56.430> put<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.260> motor<00:04:58.880> i

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
there's the other side put the motor i

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.060 
there's the other side put the motor i
can<00:05:00.540> change<00:05:00.780> their<00:05:01.020> ratios<00:05:01.470> because<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:01.889> got

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
can change their ratios because it's got

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.930 
can change their ratios because it's got
a<00:05:03.320> what<00:05:04.320> do<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.410> call<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.740> step<00:05:04.919> pull<00:05:05.160> either

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.610 

there's<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.150> acts<00:05:09.330> kind<00:05:10.199> of<00:05:10.290> got<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.500> have

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
there's the acts kind of got to have

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.770 
there's the acts kind of got to have
that<00:05:11.960> other<00:05:12.960> side<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.680> filter<00:05:14.780> finally

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
that other side of the filter finally

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.360 
that other side of the filter finally
broke<00:05:15.990> down<00:05:16.020> up<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.380> little<00:05:16.590> drained<00:05:16.919> fed<00:05:17.130> talk

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
broke down up a little drained fed talk

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.760 
broke down up a little drained fed talk
in<00:05:17.580> there<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:18.180> was<00:05:18.300> really<00:05:18.479> getting<00:05:19.410> quite<00:05:19.740> a

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
in there it was really getting quite a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.170 
in there it was really getting quite a
lot<00:05:19.950> of<00:05:19.979> water<00:05:20.220> i<00:05:20.400> think<00:05:20.760> i'm<00:05:20.850> going<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.000> find

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
lot of water i think i'm going to find

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.340 
lot of water i think i'm going to find
them<00:05:21.300> quite<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.570> bit<00:05:21.660> more<00:05:22.020> as<00:05:22.200> the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
them quite a bit more as the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.909 
them quite a bit more as the
temperatures<00:05:22.800> get<00:05:22.919> colder<00:05:24.530> last<00:05:25.530> run<00:05:25.770> was

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
temperatures get colder last run was

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.140 
temperatures get colder last run was
about<00:05:26.220> 30<00:05:26.639> degrees<00:05:27.169> fahrenheit<00:05:28.760> lot<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.940> water

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
about 30 degrees fahrenheit lot to water

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.450 
about 30 degrees fahrenheit lot to water
had<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.450> empty<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.810> condensing<00:05:31.620> tank<00:05:31.889> poison

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
had to empty that condensing tank poison

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.719 
had to empty that condensing tank poison
in<00:05:32.760> two<00:05:33.030> hours<00:05:35.270> yeah<00:05:36.830> all<00:05:37.830> good<00:05:37.889> tractors<00:05:38.550> have

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
in two hours yeah all good tractors have

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.820 
in two hours yeah all good tractors have
done<00:05:38.970> sites<00:05:39.240> but<00:05:39.449> can<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.750> say<00:05:42.080> back<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.500> the
