okay<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.650> guts<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.070> mouse<00:00:02.220> the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay this is the guts of the mouse the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay this is the guts of the mouse the
mouse<00:00:02.639> button<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.179> here<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.600> can<00:00:03.840> push<00:00:04.080> it<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.440> I

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
mouse button is here I can push it and I

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.680 
mouse button is here I can push it and I
get<00:00:05.730> firing<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.330> fast<00:00:06.540> as<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.750> can<00:00:06.899> push<00:00:07.109> it

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
get firing the fast as I can push it

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.920 
get firing the fast as I can push it
about<00:00:09.230> that<00:00:09.440> but<00:00:09.650> it's<00:00:09.770> not<00:00:09.920> very<00:00:10.160> reliable

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
about that but it's not very reliable

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.810 
about that but it's not very reliable
man<00:00:11.930> very<00:00:12.440> difficult<00:00:12.889> to<00:00:12.980> do<00:00:13.130> especially<00:00:13.460> in

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
man very difficult to do especially in

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.910 
man very difficult to do especially in
the<00:00:13.880> mouse<00:00:14.000> is<00:00:14.210> open<00:00:14.540> but<00:00:15.320> you<00:00:15.469> know<00:00:15.590> about<00:00:15.830> how

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
the mouse is open but you know about how

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.460 
the mouse is open but you know about how
fast<00:00:16.190> that<00:00:16.430> you<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:16.760> go<00:00:16.939> without<00:00:17.900> it<00:00:20.260> my<00:00:21.260> goal

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
fast that you can go without it my goal

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.650 
fast that you can go without it my goal
is<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:22.330> use<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:23.660> power<00:00:23.990> going<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:25.669> the<00:00:26.000> optical

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
is to use the power going to the optical

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.019 
is to use the power going to the optical
mouse<00:00:26.810> from<00:00:27.169> the<00:00:27.290> USB<00:00:27.619> port<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.070> add<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.579> small

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
mouse from the USB port to add a small

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.429 
mouse from the USB port to add a small
microcontroller<00:00:29.750> which<00:00:30.020> when<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.230> push<00:00:30.410> a

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
microcontroller which when I push a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.770 
microcontroller which when I push a
button<00:00:30.650> can<00:00:31.040> rapidly<00:00:31.369> fire<00:00:31.700> by<00:00:32.360> pressing<00:00:32.689> this

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
button can rapidly fire by pressing this

button can rapidly fire by pressing this
button<00:00:32.840> over<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.290> over<00:00:33.560> and<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:34.310> can<00:00:34.460> push<00:00:34.579> it

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
button over and over and I can push it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.090 
button over and over and I can push it
again<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:34.910> turn<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:35.239> off<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.630> that's<00:00:36.350> what<00:00:37.040> I'm

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
again to turn it off and that's what I'm

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.230 
again to turn it off and that's what I'm
gonna<00:00:37.190> try<00:00:37.340> I'll<00:00:37.550> see<00:00:37.700> how<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:37.880> goes<00:00:39.790> okay<00:00:40.790> here

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
gonna try I'll see how it goes okay here

the rapid fire button on the mouse when
I<00:01:01.460> push<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:02.120> light<00:01:02.390> turns<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:03.380> it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
I push it the light turns on and it

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.020 
I push it the light turns on and it
appears<00:01:04.070> steady<00:01:04.369> but<00:01:04.579> it's<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.790> little<00:01:04.909> bit

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
appears steady but it's a little bit

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.660 
appears steady but it's a little bit
deceptive<00:01:05.540> it's<00:01:06.290> actually<00:01:06.740> firing<00:01:07.100> turning

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
deceptive it's actually firing turning

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.520 
deceptive it's actually firing turning
on<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:07.909> off<00:01:07.970> very<00:01:08.360> rapidly<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.380> can

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
on and off very rapidly and we can

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.830 
on and off very rapidly and we can
illustrate<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.700> watching<00:01:11.060> its<00:01:11.420> output

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
illustrate this by watching its output

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.520 
illustrate this by watching its output
on<00:01:12.020> an<00:01:12.290> oscilloscope<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.579> I<00:01:13.640> will<00:01:14.350> clip<00:01:15.350> on

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
on an oscilloscope so I will clip on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.440 
on an oscilloscope so I will clip on
there<00:01:15.859> and<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.640> can<00:01:16.789> see<00:01:16.909> as<00:01:16.999> I<00:01:17.119> push<00:01:17.299> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
there and you can see as I push the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.090 
there and you can see as I push the
button<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.749> turns<00:01:17.929> on<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:18.229> off<00:01:18.319> on<00:01:18.619> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
button it turns on and off on the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.090 
button it turns on and off on the
oscilloscope<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:20.090> can<00:01:20.350> graph<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.560> with

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
oscilloscope we can graph it with

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.830 
oscilloscope we can graph it with
respect<00:01:22.249> to<00:01:22.490> time<00:01:22.579> it's<00:01:23.420> somewhat<00:01:23.689> like<00:01:23.810> a

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
respect to time it's somewhat like a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.169 
respect to time it's somewhat like a
voltmeter<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:24.770> can<00:01:24.979> actually<00:01:25.969> see<00:01:26.149> a

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
voltmeter but you can actually see a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.389 
voltmeter but you can actually see a
graph<00:01:26.689> of<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.020> when<00:01:27.499> I<00:01:27.530> push<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:27.979> button<00:01:28.009> it

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
graph of it when I push the button it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.819 
graph of it when I push the button it
looks<00:01:28.759> like<00:01:28.909> two<00:01:29.149> bars<00:01:29.420> right<00:01:29.780> that's<00:01:30.469> because

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
looks like two bars right that's because

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.849 
looks like two bars right that's because
if<00:01:31.819> we<00:01:32.030> speed<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.569> up<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:32.960> can<00:01:33.530> see<00:01:33.740> it's

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
if we speed it up you can see it's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.739 
if we speed it up you can see it's
actually<00:01:34.429> turning<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.119> off<00:01:35.149> very<00:01:35.509> very

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
actually turning on and off very very

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:38.109 
actually turning on and off very very
quickly<00:01:36.109> make<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.770> little<00:01:36.920> bit<00:01:37.069> faster<00:01:37.189> they

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
quickly make it a little bit faster they

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.779 
quickly make it a little bit faster they
are<00:01:38.299> square<00:01:38.659> waves<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.950> turning<00:01:40.249> on<00:01:40.579> and

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
are square waves it is turning on and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.179 
are square waves it is turning on and
off<00:01:40.850> or<00:01:41.149> pushing<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.780> fire<00:01:41.929> button<00:01:42.200> exactly

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
off or pushing the fire button exactly

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.489 
off or pushing the fire button exactly
fifty<00:01:43.549> times<00:01:43.759> every<00:01:44.359> second<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:44.899> I've

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
fifty times every second and I've

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.440 
fifty times every second and I've
configured<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.189> such<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.520> when<00:01:46.939> I<00:01:46.969> push<00:01:47.270> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
configured it such that when I push the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.539 
configured it such that when I push the
button<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:47.869> release<00:01:48.859> it<00:01:49.130> will<00:01:49.249> stay<00:01:49.399> on<00:01:49.429> for

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
button and release it will stay on for

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.230 
button and release it will stay on for
five<00:01:50.090> seconds<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.229> should<00:01:51.469> fire<00:01:52.029> 250<00:01:53.029> times

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
five seconds so it should fire 250 times

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.300 
five seconds so it should fire 250 times
over<00:01:53.749> five<00:01:53.990> seconds<00:01:54.499> so<00:01:54.649> we'll<00:01:54.889> see<00:01:55.069> how<00:01:55.189> it

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
over five seconds so we'll see how it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.349 
over five seconds so we'll see how it
works<00:01:55.490> once<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.270> put<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.630> mouse

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
works once you put it in the mouse

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.910 
works once you put it in the mouse
here's<00:01:59.359> one<00:01:59.689> more<00:01:59.810> demonstration<00:02:00.350> showing<00:02:00.649> I

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
here's one more demonstration showing I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.129 
here's one more demonstration showing I
push<00:02:01.219> it<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.850> should<00:02:02.090> stay<00:02:02.329> on<00:02:02.359> for

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
push it and it should stay on for

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.749 
push it and it should stay on for
approximately<00:02:03.229> five<00:02:03.889> seconds<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.579> should

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
approximately five seconds that should

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.429 
approximately five seconds that should
be<00:02:04.880> able<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:05.060> empty<00:02:05.329> out<00:02:05.539> pretty<00:02:06.079> much<00:02:06.170> any

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
be able to empty out pretty much any

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.940 
be able to empty out pretty much any
handgun<00:02:06.829> in<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.459> game<00:02:07.639> I<00:02:07.789> intend<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.090> play

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.160 

okay<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.670> found<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.180> bit<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.510> problem<00:02:13.720> here

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
okay I found a bit of a problem here

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.540 
okay I found a bit of a problem here
when<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> shows<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.550> delay<00:02:15.970> between<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
when it shows the delay between the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.160 
when it shows the delay between the
button<00:02:18.550> down<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.970> button<00:02:19.209> up<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.569> had<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.989> as

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
button down and button up I had it as

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.350 
button down and button up I had it as
150th<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.340> second<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.819> turns<00:02:22.060> out<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.270> was

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
150th of a second it turns out it was

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.110 
150th of a second it turns out it was
too<00:02:22.510> fast<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.050> accurately<00:02:23.440> fire<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.550> mouse

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
too fast to accurately fire the mouse

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.660 
too fast to accurately fire the mouse
I<00:02:25.150> had<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> decrease<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.650> only<00:02:26.770> fires<00:02:27.099> 25

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
I had to decrease it so it only fires 25

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.820 
I had to decrease it so it only fires 25
times<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.060> second<00:02:28.420> but<00:02:28.959> that's<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.350> good<00:02:29.560> you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
times a second but that's so good you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.410 
times a second but that's so good you
can<00:02:29.950> see<00:02:30.069> when<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> push<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.550> button<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
can see when I push the button the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.809 
can see when I push the button the
oscilloscope<00:02:32.110> will<00:02:32.709> start<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.130> go<00:02:33.250> nuts<00:02:33.489> and

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
oscilloscope will start to go nuts and

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.420 
oscilloscope will start to go nuts and
more<00:02:34.750> importantly<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.410> monitor<00:02:36.069> will<00:02:36.190> start

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
more importantly the monitor will start

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.040 
more importantly the monitor will start
to<00:02:36.520> go<00:02:36.610> nuts<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.390> thing<00:02:37.600> will<00:02:37.720> fire

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
to go nuts this thing will fire

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.780 
to go nuts this thing will fire
continuously<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:39.100> fast<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.760> possibly

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
continuously as fast as it can possibly

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.690 
continuously as fast as it can possibly
fire<00:02:40.620> until<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.800> done<00:02:43.920> okay<00:02:44.920> let's<00:02:45.459> see<00:02:45.610> this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
fire until it's done okay let's see this

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.630 
fire until it's done okay let's see this
in<00:02:45.850> action<00:02:45.970> I've<00:02:46.450> got<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.140> mouse<00:02:47.470> here<00:02:47.860> check

one more time so you can watch the watch
CMO<00:03:11.709> down<00:03:11.890> here<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.910> bottom<00:03:13.030> right

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
looks like a lagged a bit there but

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.689 
looks like a lagged a bit there but
hopefully<00:03:23.000> it'll<00:03:23.120> work<00:03:23.239> all<00:03:23.420> for<00:03:23.599> you
