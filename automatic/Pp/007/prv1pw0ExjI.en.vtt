00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.520 
could give Nintendo some easy early way
to<00:04:30.330> get<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.630> price<00:04:30.840> down<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.110> something<00:04:31.380> a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
to get the price down to something a

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.800 
to get the price down to something a
little<00:04:31.830> bit<00:04:32.040> more<00:04:32.160> competitive<00:04:32.730> but<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.090> think

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
little bit more competitive but I think

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.600 
little bit more competitive but I think
we<00:04:33.900> said<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.320> without<00:04:34.500> without<00:04:34.980> software<00:04:35.340> a

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
we said like without without software a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.250 
we said like without without software a
price<00:04:35.910> drop<00:04:36.090> really<00:04:36.510> is<00:04:36.600> kind<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:36.840> me<00:04:36.930> yeah<00:04:37.230> I

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
price drop really is kind of me yeah I

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.720 
price drop really is kind of me yeah I
mean<00:04:37.590> they've<00:04:37.710> got<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:37.980> make<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.160> money<00:04:38.400> back

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
mean they've got to make that money back

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.280 
mean they've got to make that money back
somewhere<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.690> they<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:39.990> don't<00:04:40.110> have<00:04:40.230> the

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
somewhere and they just don't have the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.810 
somewhere and they just don't have the
lineup<00:04:40.590> right<00:04:40.740> now<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:41.010> really<00:04:41.370> justify<00:04:41.670> a

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
lineup right now to really justify a

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.160 
lineup right now to really justify a
price<00:04:42.060> drop<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.420> wouldn't<00:04:42.660> be<00:04:42.720> surprised<00:04:43.050> if

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
price drop I wouldn't be surprised if

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.510 
price drop I wouldn't be surprised if
something<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.590> happens<00:04:44.040> later<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.370> the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
something like that happens later in the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.670 
something like that happens later in the
year<00:04:44.670> like<00:04:44.910> before<00:04:45.210> holiday<00:04:45.630> seasons<00:04:46.110> you

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
year like before holiday seasons you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.170 
year like before holiday seasons you
know<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.130> around<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.550> same<00:04:47.730> time<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:48.120> the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
know like around the same time that the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.300 
know like around the same time that the
xbox<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.290> for<00:04:49.530> every<00:04:49.770> thing<00:04:49.980> is<00:04:50.130> I

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
xbox and it is for every thing is I

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.290 
xbox and it is for every thing is I
guess<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.700> could<00:04:50.820> be<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.000> biggest<00:04:51.150> surprise

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
guess that could be the biggest surprise

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.970 
guess that could be the biggest surprise
we<00:04:51.630> get<00:04:51.810> out<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:52.020> Nintendo<00:04:52.440> cuz<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.890> would

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
we get out of Nintendo cuz that would

that what we see is an actual sense of

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.290 
that what we see is an actual sense of
the<00:05:46.620> game<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.190> if<00:05:47.310> they<00:05:47.400> have<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.580> mechanic<00:05:48.180> as

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
the game and if they have a mechanic as

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.290 
the game and if they have a mechanic as
inventive<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:49.020> what<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:50.010> gravity<00:05:50.520> did<00:05:51.030> in

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
development somewhere so they don't

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.430 
development somewhere so they don't
really<00:06:23.850> have<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.210> kind<00:06:24.450> of<00:06:24.510> beat<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.930> rush<00:06:25.140> for

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440

that<00:06:25.590> one<00:06:25.800> for<00:06:26.340> Sonic<00:06:26.700> I<00:06:26.850> would<00:06:27.000> be<00:06:27.090> very

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
that one for Sonic I would be very

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.580 
that one for Sonic I would be very
surprised<00:06:27.600> if<00:06:27.720> it<00:06:27.870> did<00:06:27.960> not<00:06:28.050> come<00:06:28.290> out<00:06:28.410> this

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
surprised if it did not come out this

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.620 
surprised if it did not come out this
year<00:06:28.650> yeah<00:06:29.100> I<00:06:29.280> i<00:06:29.370> SPECT<00:06:29.880> China<00:06:30.060> this<00:06:30.240> year<00:06:30.300> but

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
year yeah I i SPECT China this year but

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.180 
year yeah I i SPECT China this year but
in<00:06:30.720> terms<00:06:30.870> of<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.170> three<00:06:31.350> big<00:06:31.530> Nintendo<00:06:31.980> games

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.530 
in terms of the three big Nintendo games
I<00:06:32.430> think<00:06:32.670> if<00:06:32.820> they<00:06:32.940> were<00:06:33.000> coming<00:06:33.330> out<00:06:33.419> this

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.580 
I think if they were coming out this
year<00:06:33.770> we'd<00:06:34.770> be<00:06:34.860> going<00:06:34.980> to<00:06:35.130> a<00:06:35.190> press<00:06:35.370> conf
