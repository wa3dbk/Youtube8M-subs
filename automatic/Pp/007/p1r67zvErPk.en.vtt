number<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.700> stitches<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.540> pattern

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
number of stitches that the pattern

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.640 
number of stitches that the pattern
calls<00:04:15.230> for<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:15.920> keep<00:04:16.100> on<00:04:16.220> increasing<00:04:16.699> to

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
calls for so you keep on increasing to

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.500 
calls for so you keep on increasing to
however<00:04:18.650> number<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.130> stitches<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:20.299> need

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
pattern if the pattern says you need to

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.120 
pattern if the pattern says you need to
increase<00:04:25.610> for<00:04:25.850> example<00:04:25.940> up<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:27.199> sixty

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
increase for example up to sixty

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.460 
increase for example up to sixty
stitches<00:04:28.370> then<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.120> would<00:04:29.300> need<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.630> have<00:04:29.660> 30

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
stitches then you would need to have 30

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.850 
stitches then you would need to have 30
stitches<00:04:31.040> on<00:04:31.220> each<00:04:32.210> needle<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:33.139> those<00:04:33.620> here<00:04:33.770> on

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
stitches on each needle so those here on

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.140 
stitches on each needle so those here on
the<00:04:33.949> top<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.340> 30<00:04:34.729> at<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.330> bottom<00:04:35.949> until<00:04:37.150> you

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
the top and 30 at the bottom until you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.450 
the top and 30 at the bottom until you
are<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:39.050> basically<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.620> keep<00:04:39.770> going<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.340> keep

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
are so basically you keep going you keep

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.790 
are so basically you keep going you keep
on<00:04:40.639> increasing<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:44.110> increasing<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.590> first

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
on increasing and increasing the first

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.939 
on increasing and increasing the first
and<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.100> last<00:04:46.310> stitch<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:47.419> is<00:04:47.949> the

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
and the last stitch and that is the

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.510 
and the last stitch and that is the
formation<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.550> your<00:04:50.090> toes
