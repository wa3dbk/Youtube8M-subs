bowling leagues what we're going to do
now<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.509> we're<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> try<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.049> put<00:01:43.500> some

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
now is we're going to try to put some

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.069 
now is we're going to try to put some
tape<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.509> try<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> throw<00:01:45.960> over

tape down and then try to throw over
that<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.829> tape<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.399> order<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> mimic<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.299> throw

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that that tape in order to mimic a throw

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
that that tape in order to mimic a throw
that<00:01:49.229> would<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.470> similar<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> conditions

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that would be similar to the conditions

that would be similar to the conditions
that<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.790> were<00:01:50.939> set<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.509> way
