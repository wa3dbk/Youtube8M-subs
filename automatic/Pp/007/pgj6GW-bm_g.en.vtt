00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.040
 your car may have some 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 engine failures 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.509
 and there begins the investigation what can 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.009
 making these failures happen in 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.590
 many mechanics can lift 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 suspicions about the nozzles of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 your car 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 those responsible for playing in a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
 fuel for the burning of the engine but 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.359
 It does not always happen, it takes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.279
 careful at the time of this diagnosis 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.130
 explains that for us it is the jean keys 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.650
 after-sales manager who is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.500
 exactly a car's beak gun 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.300
 the nozzle he is an eletropaulo one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.950
 electron injected it is composed of one 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 electron by the electromagnetic system 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.149
 this nozzle is going to do the spraying 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 and will get the fuel from the tank going 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.000
 pass by the foul and will play in the spout 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.160
 injector said he has a needle 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 this needle will throw the fuel into the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.010
 combustion chamber through 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.270
 spraying and then car starts to fail 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 many markets can tell the problem 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 in the beaks how do you confirm 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 if it is really the injector nozzle that is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.729
 presenting problems in the car to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.400
 make a diagnosis and typed it goes 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.400
 having to do the check is to make a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.860
 measurement of resistance and a precise 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960
 no very precise system is also 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.280
 remove the nozzle and place in a machine 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 which is an ultrasound machine for 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.229
 make this check that the ideal 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.329
 then look for a technical team 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 merchant who have the equipment that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.960
 I can do this analysis, we 're not 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.970
 selling animals is equipment that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 has the ability to measure how many 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.869
 fuel passes through these nozzles before 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.670
 of a definitive diagnosis must be 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.619
 make an assessment before agnostics 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.299
 You have to make that evaluation 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
 naked eye there is no way we can do this 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.270
 verification project many people are 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 at home 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.259
 know about products or people who apply 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.740
 motor products to clean the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.880
 beaks 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 these products works the whole beak 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.310
 nozzle manufacturer them in 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.649
 They go to technical nÃ³is the nozzle it 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.330
 has a self- cleaning system only that the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.269
 We know it's our non-fuel. 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.640
 100% reliable fuel then it is 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.709
 always good to do a cleanse of a beak 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 this cleaning by ultrasound 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.060
 which is the most efficient 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.940
 I particularly do not recommend doing the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.410
 cleaning through products in the tank 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.230
 can do the cleaning but it is not a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.380
 100% company needs to prevent this 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.970
 What is the best recipe you give? 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.180
 always use good fuel. 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.920
 quality is a little insurance pays a 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.340
 little more expensive but also has a 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.410
 efficiency and various engine components 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.360
 of your vehicle then you are a 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.280
 marketing prevention that includes 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.440
 preference for gasoline added by 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.380
 example gasoline additive gasoline 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.019
 prize is you should put in your car 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.040
 the jean by jeep so there is a 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.510
 draws your attention 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.299
 before saying that the problem in the pit 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.000
 manager do an evaluation in workshops 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.400
 which have specific mechanisms to 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 evaluation of the nozzles that make an exchange 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.510
 do no expense than you maybe you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.959
 do not need to make your car 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.959
 works perfectly
