00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello to all marie-christine develops 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.130
 leak of a trailer to help you 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.500
 perform an outdoor exercise in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.420
 gym at home short trip 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.179
 as I am currently for a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.109
 photo shoot at las vegas nevada 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.210
 So I try as the heat here is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 very very wise and very very hot because 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.550
 that we did not go out desert and after 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 14 hours flight so you still have to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.199
 a little stretch your legs for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.350
 avoid odors and the sensation of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.790
 swollen legs so for that you have 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.829
 a few small exercises you can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.020
 easily do indoors or even 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.059
 without material and you will see this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.390
 will help a lot to recover at the level 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 people so here it's easy 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.969
 will work the hamstrings hamstring 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.100
 back of the thighs and gluteus maximus 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.890
 so simply if you have a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.360
 chair with you and in the hotels and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.969
 such studios do not know what there is 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.730
 more difficult to have so you the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.770
 place well before like these then 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.620
 you hang under the ribs and 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.600
 buy your legs preferably 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.070
 slightly bent is much better 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.680
 like that at least people 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.600
 will work a maintenance work in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.540
 mastery level on one leg during 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.590
 that the other will work here back of 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.910
 gluteal thighs 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.170
 on the other side tight teen flat belly 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.170
 right and it's gone 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.800
 I'm trying to get everybody to study 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 tip of the feet she is slightly on 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.410
 the side you see it's seeing the game 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.410
 which can be returned 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.950
 so when you meet 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.510
 and I change sides 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.959
 in Corsica 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 no 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.819
 and I 'm sailing so at least that you 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.800
 will be able to work a little 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.920
 little back of the thighs and facts 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 it's like game 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.209
 to be able to avoid this sensation 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.819
 systematic of jean boufflers where our 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.180

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.680
 heat that both pacifiers and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.540
