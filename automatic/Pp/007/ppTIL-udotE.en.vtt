00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
rounder buns we're gonna just use any

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.370 
rounder buns we're gonna just use any
old<00:02:18.890> one<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.630> right<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.140> choose

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
old one like that right you can choose

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.810 
old one like that right you can choose
the<00:02:21.560> low<00:02:21.680> school<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.040> high<00:02:22.190> school<00:02:22.220> also<00:02:22.670> ours

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
the low school and high school also ours

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.890 
the low school and high school also ours
it's<00:02:23.030> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.240> be<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> highest<00:02:23.690> ROI

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
it's going to be the highest ROI

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.580 
it's going to be the highest ROI
building<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.680> zero<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.700> two<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.320> can<00:02:27.350> make

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
building so zero to two and you can make

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.900 
building so zero to two and you can make
the<00:02:27.710> shaft<00:02:27.950> as<00:02:28.160> wide<00:02:28.340> as<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:28.550> now<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
the shaft as wide as you can now the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.440 
the shaft as wide as you can now the
x-axis<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:29.990> usually<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:31.550> across<00:02:32.090> so

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
x-axis is usually the one across so

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.860 
x-axis is usually the one across so
basically<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.200> why<00:02:33.350> do<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.620> want<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.070> it

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
basically the why do you want to have it

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.870 
basically the why do you want to have it
like<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> oh<00:02:36.620> yeah<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.490> doesn't<00:02:37.790> really

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
like kind of oh yeah it doesn't really

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.070 
like kind of oh yeah it doesn't really
matter<00:02:38.150> which<00:02:38.300> way<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.900> list

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
matter which way you have it the list

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.350 
matter which way you have it the list
and<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.260> placed<00:02:39.770> along<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.190> longest<00:02:40.640> side<00:02:40.850> but

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
and we placed along the longest side but

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.150 
and we placed along the longest side but
I<00:02:41.390> make<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.840> x-axis<00:02:42.350> wider<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.770> I'm<00:02:42.830> gonna<00:02:42.950> put

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
I make the x-axis wider so I'm gonna put

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.470 
I make the x-axis wider so I'm gonna put
that's<00:02:43.340> 20<00:02:44.350> I'll<00:02:45.350> put<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> Z<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:46.840> 16<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:49.480> we're

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
that's 20 I'll put the Z to 16 and we're

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.380 
that's 20 I'll put the Z to 16 and we're
gonna<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.560> write<00:02:51.940> two<00:02:52.940> lives<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.300> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
design

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.420 
design
might<00:04:26.259> take<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.470> while<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.710> load<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:26.979> think<00:04:27.310> this

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
might take a while to load I think this

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.279 
might take a while to load I think this
isn't<00:04:27.669> gonna<00:04:27.910> load<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.449> usually<00:04:28.900> takes<00:04:29.169> two

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
isn't gonna load it usually takes two

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.350 
isn't gonna load it usually takes two
I've<00:04:30.129> done<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.430> doesn't<00:04:30.729> always<00:04:30.819> load<00:04:31.090> but

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
I've done it doesn't always load but

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.999 
I've done it doesn't always load but
yeah<00:04:31.599> basically<00:04:31.780> that's<00:04:32.169> how<00:04:32.349> you<00:04:32.440> do<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.830> so

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
yeah basically that's how you do it so

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.189 
yeah basically that's how you do it so
it's<00:04:33.190> pretty<00:04:33.370> good<00:04:33.490> greater<00:04:33.879> and<00:04:34.360> well<00:04:34.870> yeah

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
it's pretty good greater and well yeah

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.440 
it's pretty good greater and well yeah
boy
