00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and then you see where the little bit

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820 
and then you see where the little bit
the<00:02:11.670> excess<00:02:12.060> sticker<00:02:12.360> came<00:02:12.630> up<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:13.740> you

the excess sticker came up but you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.490 
the excess sticker came up but you
actually<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:15.030> hole<00:02:15.510> now<00:02:15.720> through<00:02:16.320> both

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
actually have a hole now through both

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.410 
actually have a hole now through both
the<00:02:16.680> sticker<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.610> aluminum<00:02:18.000> blank<00:02:18.210> which

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the sticker and the aluminum blank which

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.730 
the sticker and the aluminum blank which
is<00:02:18.540> very<00:02:18.750> handy<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.110> there's<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> little<00:02:19.620> bit

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
is very handy and there's a little bit

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.520 
is very handy and there's a little bit
of<00:02:19.860> extra<00:02:20.190> sticker<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.380> just

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
of extra sticker in there so I'm just

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
of extra sticker in there so I'm just
going<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.710> take<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> head<00:02:23.100> pin<00:02:23.480> push<00:02:24.480> that

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
going to take a head pin push that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.400 
going to take a head pin push that
through

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
through

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.400 
through
and<00:02:25.580> there<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.270> hole<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.290> that's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
and there you have the hole so that's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.740 
and there you have the hole so that's
definitely<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> easiest<00:02:29.370> method<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.210> that's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
definitely the easiest method and that's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.450 
definitely the easiest method and that's
what<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:30.930> looks<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.350> now<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.920> second

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
what that looks like now the second

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.220 
what that looks like now the second
method<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.000> want<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.210> show<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.690> using<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
method I want to show you is using a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.190 
method I want to show you is using a
glass<00:02:34.440> dome<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.850> with<00:02:36.000> glass<00:02:36.270> domes<00:02:36.600> you'll

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
glass dome so with glass domes you'll

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.130 
glass dome so with glass domes you'll
often<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.100> choice<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.700> your<00:02:39.000> height<00:02:39.210> so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
often have a choice of your height so

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.690 
often have a choice of your height so
you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.220> has<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> lowest

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you can see this one has the lowest

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.330 
you can see this one has the lowest
profile<00:02:42.300> medium<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.290> then<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> high<00:02:43.830> profile

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
profile medium and then a high profile

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.580 
profile medium and then a high profile
so<00:02:45.120> depending<00:02:45.630> upon<00:02:45.720> which<00:02:45.990> one<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.320> choose

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
so depending upon which one you choose

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.010 
so depending upon which one you choose
is<00:02:46.860> how<00:02:47.000> magnified<00:02:48.000> your<00:02:48.360> image<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
is how magnified your image is going to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.200 
is how magnified your image is going to
become<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.790> probably<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.120> be

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
become this one here is probably to be

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.120 
become this one here is probably to be
pretty<00:02:51.360> dramatic<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.350> here's<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> lower

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
pretty dramatic so here's with the lower

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.570 
pretty dramatic so here's with the lower
profile<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:56.570> here<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.560> medium<00:02:58.980> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
profile one here is with the medium you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.250 
profile one here is with the medium you
see<00:02:59.790> how<00:02:59.910> that<00:02:59.970> image<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.420> got<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> lot<00:03:01.080> bigger

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
see how that image just got a lot bigger

see how that image just got a lot bigger
and<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:02.430> here's<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.790> high<00:03:03.060> profile<00:03:05.270> there<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.450> go

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
to touch that one I'm going to let it

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.190 
to touch that one I'm going to let it
dry<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.739> then<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.850> third<00:04:06.150> way<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.450> can<00:04:06.780> alter

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
appearance is with resin and I've done

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.590 
appearance is with resin and I've done

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
video I'm going to use a UV resin this

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.360 
video I'm going to use a UV resin this
is<00:04:27.090> Lisa<00:04:27.390> Pavelka<00:04:28.050> magic<00:04:28.470> gloss<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.100> cures

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
is Lisa Pavelka magic gloss and it cures

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.640 
is Lisa Pavelka magic gloss and it cures
with<00:04:29.610> UV<00:04:30.000> light<00:04:30.240> or<00:04:30.510> direct<00:04:30.990> sunlight<00:04:31.260> I

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
with UV light or direct sunlight I

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.220 
with UV light or direct sunlight I
actually<00:04:31.920> have<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.700> UV<00:04:33.150> lamp<00:04:33.510> right<00:04:33.810> here<00:04:34.140> I'm

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
actually have a UV lamp right here I'm

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.500 
actually have a UV lamp right here I'm
going<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.410> be<00:04:34.530> using<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.760> could<00:04:35.970> do<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.270> eat

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
going to be using you could do this eat

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.870 
going to be using you could do this eat
very<00:04:36.780> easily<00:04:37.080> with<00:04:37.380> two-part<00:04:37.890> resin<00:04:38.100> as<00:04:38.490> well

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
very easily with two-part resin as well

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.450 
very easily with two-part resin as well
and<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.780> might<00:04:40.080> actually<00:04:40.290> recommend<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.160> just

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
and I might actually recommend that just

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.770 
and I might actually recommend that just
because<00:04:41.700> we're<00:04:41.790> going<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:41.970> be<00:04:42.060> doming<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
because we're going to be doming it and

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.210 
because we're going to be doming it and
then<00:04:42.930> we<00:04:43.020> actually<00:04:43.170> have<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.500> pick<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.800> up<00:04:44.010> and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
then we actually have to pick it up and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.340 
then we actually have to pick it up and
put<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.940> into<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.270> UV<00:04:45.600> light<00:04:45.840> whereas<00:04:46.230> if

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
put it into the UV light whereas if

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.290 
put it into the UV light whereas if
you've<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:46.800> got<00:04:46.920> two<00:04:47.340> part<00:04:47.550> resin<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:48.150> don't

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
you've just got two part resin you don't

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.210 
you've just got two part resin you don't
have<00:04:48.420> to<00:04:48.570> move<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.110> so<00:04:49.380> every<00:04:49.800> time<00:04:49.920> you<00:04:50.040> move

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
have to move it so every time you move

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.590 
have to move it so every time you move
it<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.580> risk<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:52.500> spilling<00:04:53.370> over<00:04:53.670> so

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
it you do risk it's spilling over so

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.570 
it you do risk it's spilling over so
I've<00:04:54.720> taken<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:55.110> little<00:04:55.290> post-it<00:04:55.710> note<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.130> fold

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
I've taken a little post-it note I fold

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.250 
I've taken a little post-it note I fold
it<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.910> half<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.420> it's<00:04:57.540> going<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.690> be<00:04:57.810> my<00:04:57.960> tray

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
it in half and it's going to be my tray

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.460 
it in half and it's going to be my tray
so<00:04:58.740> what<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.040> want<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> do<00:04:59.600> is<00:05:00.600> I<00:05:00.840> want<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.080> put<00:05:01.290> my

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
so what I want to do is I want to put my

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.350 
so what I want to do is I want to put my
lillypilly<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:02.390> top<00:05:03.390> of<00:05:03.630> my<00:05:03.780> post-it<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.850> now

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
lillypilly on top of my post-it and now

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.190 
lillypilly on top of my post-it and now
I've<00:05:06.540> got<00:05:06.810> my<00:05:08.240> resin<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.450> I'm<00:05:09.690> going<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:09.870> drip

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
I've got my resin and I'm going to drip

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.370 
I've got my resin and I'm going to drip
it<00:05:10.380> in<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.680> middle<00:05:13.490> then<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.810> try<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.870> not<00:05:16.170> do

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
it in the middle then I try to not do

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.970 
it in the middle then I try to not do
too<00:05:16.650> much<00:05:16.830> all<00:05:17.130> at<00:05:17.310> once<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:19.080> actually<00:05:19.470> I<00:05:19.500> have

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
too much all at once and actually I have

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.540 
too much all at once and actually I have
a<00:05:20.420> head<00:05:21.420> pin<00:05:21.630> here<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.020> I'm<00:05:22.110> using<00:05:22.520> use<00:05:23.520> a

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
a head pin here that I'm using use a

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.420 
a head pin here that I'm using use a
toothpick<00:05:24.030> as<00:05:24.180> well<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.590> I'm<00:05:25.980> going<00:05:26.190> to<00:05:26.250> use

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
toothpick as well and I'm going to use

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:38.760 
toothpick as well and I'm going to use
it<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.790> spread<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:28.200> resin<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.190> edges

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.920 

and<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.430> surface<00:05:39.849> tension<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.509> actually

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
and the surface tension is actually

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.710 
and the surface tension is actually
going<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.139> be<00:05:41.500> what<00:05:41.680> keeps<00:05:41.889> it<00:05:42.270> from<00:05:43.270> spilling

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
going to be what keeps it from spilling

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.900 
going to be what keeps it from spilling
over<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.620> actually<00:05:45.099> creating<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.460> nice<00:05:45.610> little

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
over and actually creating a nice little

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.640 
over and actually creating a nice little
dome<00:05:46.060> shape<00:05:51.539> be<00:05:52.539> patient<00:05:53.110> don't<00:05:53.380> go<00:05:53.590> too

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
dome shape be patient don't go too

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.969 
dome shape be patient don't go too
quickly<00:05:54.069> with<00:05:54.400> this<00:05:55.470> because<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:56.620> don't<00:05:56.830> want

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
quickly with this because you don't want

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.610 
quickly with this because you don't want
to<00:05:57.039> break<00:05:57.160> that<00:05:57.220> surface<00:05:57.849> tension<00:05:59.460> all<00:06:00.460> right

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
to break that surface tension all right

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.080 
to break that surface tension all right
now<00:06:02.620> I<00:06:02.680> actually<00:06:03.099> feel<00:06:03.460> like<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.789> can<00:06:03.970> get<00:06:04.030> a

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
now I actually feel like I can get a

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.700 
now I actually feel like I can get a
little<00:06:04.240> higher<00:06:04.479> dome<00:06:04.810> on<00:06:05.020> this<00:06:05.169> one<00:06:05.380> so<00:06:05.590> I'm

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
little higher dome on this one so I'm

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.689 
little higher dome on this one so I'm
going<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:05.860> put<00:06:06.039> another<00:06:06.099> drop<00:06:06.520> in<00:06:06.550> the<00:06:06.759> middle

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
going to put another drop in the middle

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.279 
going to put another drop in the middle
usually<00:06:09.699> another<00:06:09.880> two<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.660> I'm<00:06:10.840> happy<00:06:11.199> with

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
usually another two and I'm happy with

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.580 
usually another two and I'm happy with
that<00:06:12.449> now<00:06:13.449> I<00:06:13.509> have<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.900> couple<00:06:14.050> little<00:06:14.259> air

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
that now I have a couple little air

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:31.980 
quick with the micro torch you saw how
quickly<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.449> was<00:06:31.569> good<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:31.810> don't<00:06:31.900> want

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
now I'm going to turn on my UV light and

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.510 
now I'm going to turn on my UV light and
I<00:06:37.210> am<00:06:37.360> just<00:06:37.630> going<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.930> go<00:06:38.199> ahead<00:06:38.319> and<00:06:38.740> stick

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
I am just going to go ahead and stick

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.899 
I am just going to go ahead and stick
that<00:06:39.900> in<00:06:40.900> there<00:06:41.530> and<00:06:41.800> that<00:06:42.280> looks<00:06:42.490> pretty<00:06:42.550> flat

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.909 
that in there and that looks pretty flat

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.120 
that in there and that looks pretty flat
to<00:06:43.240> me<00:06:43.330> if<00:06:43.539> yours<00:06:43.810> doesn't<00:06:44.199> look<00:06:44.229> flat<00:06:44.560> if<00:06:44.919> your

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
to me if yours doesn't look flat if your

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.370 
to me if yours doesn't look flat if your
surface<00:06:45.520> here<00:06:45.969> it's<00:06:46.479> a<00:06:46.539> little<00:06:46.630> wobble<00:06:47.169> but

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
surface here it's a little wobble but

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.230 
surface here it's a little wobble but
actually<00:06:47.800> I<00:06:47.860> can<00:06:47.979> see<00:06:48.130> that<00:06:48.280> the<00:06:48.490> lillypilly

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
actually I can see that the lillypilly

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.260 
actually I can see that the lillypilly
itself<00:06:49.719> is<00:06:49.900> flat<00:06:50.169> if<00:06:50.469> it's<00:06:51.310> not<00:06:51.490> flat<00:06:51.789> try<00:06:52.210> to

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
itself is flat if it's not flat try to

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.510 
itself is flat if it's not flat try to
make<00:06:52.539> it<00:06:52.659> so<00:06:52.840> or<00:06:53.110> try<00:06:53.320> to<00:06:53.380> very<00:06:53.800> carefully<00:06:54.370> use

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
make it so or try to very carefully use

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.700 
make it so or try to very carefully use
your<00:06:54.669> fingernail<00:06:55.320> without<00:06:56.320> touching<00:06:56.530> the

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
your fingernail without touching the

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.580 
your fingernail without touching the
resin<00:06:57.039> and<00:06:57.190> scoop<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.759> lillypilly<00:06:58.240> around<00:06:58.659> so

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
resin and scoop the lillypilly around so

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.560 
resin and scoop the lillypilly around so
that's<00:06:59.830> completely<00:07:00.580> level<00:07:01.030> otherwise<00:07:01.360> you'll

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
that's completely level otherwise you'll

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.420 
that's completely level otherwise you'll
have<00:07:01.599> a<00:07:01.719> dip<00:07:01.990> in<00:07:02.199> your<00:07:02.229> resin<00:07:02.650> so<00:07:03.130> I'm<00:07:03.250> going<00:07:03.370> to

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
have a dip in your resin so I'm going to

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.339 
have a dip in your resin so I'm going to
put<00:07:03.580> this<00:07:03.669> in<00:07:03.820> the<00:07:03.909> light<00:07:04.090> for<00:07:04.389> 15<00:07:04.780> minutes<00:07:05.139> and

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
put this in the light for 15 minutes and

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.080 
put this in the light for 15 minutes and
then<00:07:05.409> it's<00:07:06.009> going<00:07:06.130> to<00:07:06.190> come<00:07:06.340> out<00:07:06.550> and<00:07:06.820> it's

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
then it's going to come out and it's

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.089 
then it's going to come out and it's
going<00:07:07.240> to<00:07:07.360> be<00:07:07.419> solid<00:07:07.810> like<00:07:07.840> this<00:07:07.990> one<00:07:08.349> so

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:09.099 
going to be solid like this one so

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.559 
going to be solid like this one so
there's<00:07:09.280> three<00:07:09.550> different<00:07:09.580> options<00:07:10.210> for<00:07:10.389> you

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:10.569 
there's three different options for you

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.749 
there's three different options for you
on<00:07:10.750> using<00:07:11.380> the<00:07:11.530> lillypilly<00:07:11.979> aluminum<00:07:12.280> blanks

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 
on using the lillypilly aluminum blanks

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:15.089 
on using the lillypilly aluminum blanks
and<00:07:13.330> using<00:07:14.289> them<00:07:14.409> in<00:07:14.500> conjunction<00:07:14.650> with<00:07:15.039> the

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099 
and using them in conjunction with the

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:16.800 
and using them in conjunction with the
epoxy<00:07:15.340> stickers<00:07:15.819> which<00:07:16.000> is<00:07:16.150> very<00:07:16.539> quick<00:07:16.719> and

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
epoxy stickers which is very quick and

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.330 
epoxy stickers which is very quick and
easy<00:07:16.990> the<00:07:18.599> glass<00:07:19.599> tiles<00:07:20.139> which<00:07:20.500> is<00:07:20.740> very<00:07:21.069> easy

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
easy the glass tiles which is very easy

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.040 
easy the glass tiles which is very easy
as<00:07:21.520> well<00:07:21.669> and<00:07:21.909> then<00:07:22.060> a<00:07:22.090> little<00:07:22.419> bit<00:07:22.599> more<00:07:22.810> work

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
as well and then a little bit more work

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.899 
as well and then a little bit more work
is<00:07:23.289> the<00:07:23.650> resin<00:07:24.039> but<00:07:24.159> it<00:07:24.250> has<00:07:24.370> a<00:07:24.400> really<00:07:24.639> nice

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:24.909 
is the resin but it has a really nice
