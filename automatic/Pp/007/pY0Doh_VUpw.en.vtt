00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
something we're very iterative what we

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.540 
something we're very iterative what we

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
important on that multiplayer where you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.190 
important on that multiplayer where you
want<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.790> get<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.330> there<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.510> see<00:02:14.840> what<00:02:15.020> works

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
want to get in there and see what works

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720

and<00:02:15.440> what<00:02:15.530> doesn't<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.950> what<00:02:16.099> feels<00:02:16.370> right<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and what doesn't and what feels right it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.030 
and what doesn't and what feels right it
really<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> lot<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.870> kind<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.200> feeling<00:02:18.920> it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
