can never find the perfect laptop but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.839 
can never find the perfect laptop but
this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> potential<00:00:28.080> probably<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.849> potential

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
this is a potential probably a potential

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.380 
this is a potential probably a potential
good<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:31.349> an<00:00:31.500> Asus<00:00:32.000> g-46

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
good one and it's an Asus g-46

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
good one and it's an Asus g-46
and<00:00:33.770> it's<00:00:35.780> well<00:00:36.780> technically<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and it's well technically it's the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.080 
and it's well technically it's the
latest<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:41.059> compared<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
latest one that's out but compared to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
latest one that's out but compared to
other<00:00:42.210> computers<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.680> date<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
other computers it's out of date and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
other computers it's out of date and
then<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.059> might<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.480> well<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:46.710> wouldn't

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
then you might be like well but wouldn't

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
then you might be like well but wouldn't
you<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> latest<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> greatest<00:00:47.969> most

you want the latest and greatest most

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.130 
you want the latest and greatest most
powerful<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> particular<00:00:50.370> case<00:00:51.140> for

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
powerful and in this particular case for

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.700 
powerful and in this particular case for
laptops<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.489> me<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:54.350> what<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> care

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
laptops and for me know what I care

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.270 
laptops and for me know what I care
about<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> laptop<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.390> looks<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
about on the laptop is one the looks and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.969 
about on the laptop is one the looks and
-<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.640> big<00:01:00.090> -<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> fans<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.359> overall

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
- a big - is the fans and the overall

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
- a big - is the fans and the overall
not<00:01:04.979> necessarily<00:01:05.549> performance<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.360> how<00:01:06.570> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
not necessarily performance but how it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
not necessarily performance but how it
yeah<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.380> guess<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.740> would<00:01:07.799> perform<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
yeah I guess I would perform so it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
yeah I guess I would perform so it
doesn't<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> mean<00:01:09.320> statistics<00:01:10.320> but

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
doesn't have to mean statistics but

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
doesn't have to mean statistics but
anyway<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> notice

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
anyway I don't know if you can notice

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.219 
anyway I don't know if you can notice
but<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.470> actually<00:01:13.619> playing<00:01:14.330> Far<00:01:15.330> Cry<00:01:15.509> 3<00:01:15.600> here

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
but I'm actually playing Far Cry 3 here

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.670 
but I'm actually playing Far Cry 3 here
and<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.939> decent<00:01:18.810> fps<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.320> guess<00:01:19.500> here

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and you don't at decent fps I guess here

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.840 
and you don't at decent fps I guess here
let<00:01:19.860> me<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.729> more

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
let me just make this a little bit more

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
let me just make this a little bit more

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.289 
focused I just started the game up but I
was<00:01:23.009> playing<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.460> restarted<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
was playing I just restarted because I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.539 
was playing I just restarted because I
installed<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.110> new<00:01:25.650> mod<00:01:25.920> which<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.310> actually

installed a new mod which is actually
really<00:01:26.610> interesting<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.369> if

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
really interesting but I don't know if

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.530 
really interesting but I don't know if
you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.610> notice<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> oh<00:01:31.280> wait<00:01:32.329> there's<00:01:33.329> no

especially<00:02:15.050> for<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.260> money<00:02:15.410> if<00:02:15.950> you're

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
especially for the money if you're

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.670 
especially for the money if you're
wondering<00:02:16.310> about<00:02:16.340> specs<00:02:16.849> it's<00:02:17.150> got<00:02:17.330> an<00:02:17.450> i-5<00:02:17.930> 32

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
wondering about specs it's got an i-5 32

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.400 
wondering about specs it's got an i-5 32
30<00:02:19.129> M<00:02:19.430> which<00:02:20.000> you're<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:20.660> oh<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:20.780> dual-core

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
30 M which you're like oh it's dual-core

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.070 
30 M which you're like oh it's dual-core
but<00:02:22.129> in<00:02:22.220> gaming<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:23.480> might<00:02:23.629> actually<00:02:23.810> even

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
but in gaming you might actually even

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.850 
but in gaming you might actually even
get<00:02:24.200> better<00:02:24.349> performance<00:02:24.590> with<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.099> because

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
get better performance with this because

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.520 
get better performance with this because
because<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.340> at<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.519> higher<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.690> clock

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
because it's at a higher like clock

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.589 
because it's at a higher like clock
speed<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:31.069> whatever<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.489> 2.6<00:02:32.209> gigahertz

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
speed or whatever it's at 2.6 gigahertz

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.830 
speed or whatever it's at 2.6 gigahertz
whereas<00:02:33.080> most<00:02:33.310> quad<00:02:34.310> cores<00:02:34.580> are<00:02:34.760> at<00:02:34.819> like<00:02:35.090> 2.7

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
whereas most quad cores are at like 2.7

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.740 
whereas most quad cores are at like 2.7
or<00:02:36.140> 2.4<00:02:36.860> s'alright<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.450> might<00:02:38.599> actually

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
or 2.4 s'alright so you might actually

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.479 
or 2.4 s'alright so you might actually
get<00:02:39.019> better<00:02:39.530> performance<00:02:39.709> depending<00:02:40.310> on<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
get better performance depending on the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.960 
get better performance depending on the
game<00:02:40.700> but<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.230> all<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.739> usage<00:02:43.489> I'm<00:02:43.790> not

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
game but all in all in my usage I'm not

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.920 
game but all in all in my usage I'm not
going<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.150> be<00:02:44.209> needing<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.989> i7<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:47.299> just

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
going to be needing the i7 and I just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.690 
going to be needing the i7 and I just
and<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:50.030> got<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.209> gtx<00:02:50.660> 660<00:02:51.260> m<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.890> one<00:02:52.519> big

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and it's got a gtx 660 m and one big

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.190 
and it's got a gtx 660 m and one big
advantage<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.480> thing<00:02:53.660> has<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:54.079> there

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
advantage that this thing has is there

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.350 
advantage that this thing has is there
could<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.440> no<00:02:54.650> throttling<00:02:55.340> because<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.209> only

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
could be no throttling because the only

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.199 
could be no throttling because the only
reason<00:02:56.709> computers<00:02:57.709> throttle<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.340> because

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
reason computers throttle is because

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.350 
reason computers throttle is because
they<00:02:59.540> don't<00:03:00.349> like<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.340> they<00:03:01.610> overheat<00:03:02.030> so

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
they don't like the they overheat so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.780 
they don't like the they overheat so
they<00:03:02.540> throttle<00:03:03.019> them<00:03:03.170> down<00:03:03.829> so<00:03:04.640> they<00:03:04.760> don't

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
they throttle them down so they don't

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.319 
they throttle them down so they don't
overheat<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:06.110> thing<00:03:06.730> when<00:03:07.730> doing<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.150> most

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
overheat this thing when doing the most

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.080 
overheat this thing when doing the most
demanding<00:03:08.989> benchmarks<00:03:09.590> runs<00:03:09.920> at<00:03:10.160> 70<00:03:10.730> degrees

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
demanding benchmarks runs at 70 degrees

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.870 
demanding benchmarks runs at 70 degrees
which<00:03:12.049> especially<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.920> gaming<00:03:13.370> laptops<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
which especially for gaming laptops and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000 
which especially for gaming laptops and
even<00:03:13.910> for<00:03:14.239> desktops<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:15.380> pretty<00:03:15.709> impressive

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
even for desktops is pretty impressive

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.129 
even for desktops is pretty impressive
and<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:17.120> reasons<00:03:17.420> for<00:03:17.660> all<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:17.959> good

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
and the reasons for all this good

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.530 
and the reasons for all this good
cooling<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.709> these<00:03:18.980> two<00:03:19.220> nice<00:03:19.370> fans<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:22.510> yeah<00:03:23.510> I

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
cooling is these two nice fans so yeah I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.360 
cooling is these two nice fans so yeah I
mean<00:03:23.870> they<00:03:24.139> do<00:03:24.200> get<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.709> job<00:03:24.739> done<00:03:25.069> in<00:03:25.220> any

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
mean they do get the job done in any

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.690 
mean they do get the job done in any
Asus<00:03:25.880> laptop<00:03:26.030> gaming<00:03:26.840> laptop<00:03:27.250> will<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.489> this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
Asus laptop gaming laptop will have this

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.199 
Asus laptop gaming laptop will have this
sort<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.260> niceness<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.739> mean<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.250> had<00:03:31.760> an<00:03:31.880> Asus

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
sort of niceness I mean I had an Asus

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.449 
sort of niceness I mean I had an Asus
g73<00:03:32.780> before<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> really<00:03:33.889> long<00:03:34.100> time<00:03:34.280> ago<00:03:34.430> like

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
g73 before a really long time ago like

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.319 
g73 before a really long time ago like
two<00:03:34.819> or<00:03:35.329> three<00:03:35.540> years<00:03:35.720> ago<00:03:37.120> yeah<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.150> think

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
two or three years ago yeah I think

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.640 
two or three years ago yeah I think
three<00:03:38.900> years<00:03:39.109> ago<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.810> yeah<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.959> performed<00:03:42.440> in

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
three years ago and yeah it performed in

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.349 
three years ago and yeah it performed in
the<00:03:42.769> same<00:03:43.010> manner<00:03:43.280> meaning<00:03:43.639> it's<00:03:43.880> performed

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
the same manner meaning it's performed

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.099 
the same manner meaning it's performed
extremely<00:03:44.660> well

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
extremely well

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.479 
extremely well
and<00:03:47.290> yeah<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.530> looked<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:48.950> thing<00:03:49.160> and

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
and yeah I just looked the thing and

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.690 
and yeah I just looked the thing and
yeah<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:51.139> doesn't<00:03:51.500> at<00:03:51.920> least<00:03:51.980> as<00:03:52.340> far<00:03:52.489> as<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.639> can

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
yeah it doesn't at least as far as I can

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.300 
yeah it doesn't at least as far as I can
tell<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.120> far<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.389> has<00:03:53.540> no<00:03:53.750> gimmicks<00:03:54.319> or<00:03:54.560> or

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
tell so far it has no gimmicks or or

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.589 
tell so far it has no gimmicks or or
like<00:03:55.599> problems<00:03:56.599> like<00:03:56.930> for<00:03:57.920> example<00:03:58.480> VLAN<00:03:59.480> I'm

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
like problems like for example VLAN I'm

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.250 
like problems like for example VLAN I'm
just<00:03:59.750> plugging<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.139> back<00:04:00.349> on<00:04:00.560> my<00:04:01.389> things<00:04:02.389> so

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
just plugging in back on my things so

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.250 
just plugging in back on my things so
for<00:04:03.470> example<00:04:03.859> like<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.069> Sager<00:04:04.310> had<00:04:04.880> bad<00:04:05.750> sound

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
for example like the Sager had bad sound

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.890 
for example like the Sager had bad sound
the<00:04:07.160> build<00:04:07.549> quality<00:04:07.790> wasn't<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.389> good<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.840> a

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
the build quality wasn't that good and a

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.140 
the build quality wasn't that good and a
couple<00:04:09.079> other<00:04:09.319> things<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.680> fan<00:04:09.919> noise<00:04:10.150> but

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
couple other things the fan noise but

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.440 
couple other things the fan noise but
this<00:04:11.450> one<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:11.900> mean<00:04:12.290> if<00:04:13.010> anything<00:04:13.849> I<00:04:14.090> mean<00:04:14.239> I

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
this one I mean if anything I mean I

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.509 
this one I mean if anything I mean I
guess<00:04:14.660> it'd<00:04:15.200> be<00:04:15.319> nice<00:04:15.500> if<00:04:15.709> they<00:04:15.859> released<00:04:16.310> the

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
guess it'd be nice if they released the

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.029 
guess it'd be nice if they released the
next<00:04:16.820> gen<00:04:17.060> one<00:04:17.269> sooner<00:04:17.780> but<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:18.560> can't<00:04:18.919> really

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
next gen one sooner but I can't really

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.199 
next gen one sooner but I can't really
say<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.430> because<00:04:19.549> they<00:04:19.700> probably<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.090> do<00:04:20.180> a

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
say that because they probably to do a

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.069 
say that because they probably to do a
good<00:04:20.479> job<00:04:20.539> on<00:04:20.930> it

other<00:06:02.920> power<00:06:03.220> bricks<00:06:03.580> I'd<00:06:03.880> say<00:06:04.180> it's<00:06:04.330> about

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
other power bricks I'd say it's about

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.930 
other power bricks I'd say it's about
average<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:05.380> that's<00:06:05.950> not<00:06:06.160> a<00:06:06.220> bad<00:06:06.910> thing
