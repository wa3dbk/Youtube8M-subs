dowel screens silver and gold
so<00:00:10.700> there's<00:00:11.700> plate<00:00:12.000> first

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.610 

alright<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:52.880> corporate<00:00:53.840> aggressions<00:00:54.380> are

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
alright so the corporate aggressions are

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.030 
alright so the corporate aggressions are
pretty<00:00:54.860> easy<00:00:55.190> for<00:00:55.640> these<00:00:56.560> first<00:00:57.560> you<00:00:57.710> start

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
pretty easy for these first you start

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.230 
pretty easy for these first you start
out<00:00:58.130> with<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.550> G<00:00:59.240> chord<00:00:59.510> or<00:00:59.810> no<00:00:59.900> G<00:01:00.200> chord

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
out with the G chord or no G chord

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.960 
out with the G chord or no G chord
except<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.800> take<00:01:04.010> your<00:01:04.190> ring<00:01:04.400> finger<00:01:04.790> what

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
except you take your ring finger what

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.840 
except you take your ring finger what
you<00:01:05.150> usually<00:01:05.420> put<00:01:05.960> on<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.440> high<00:01:07.160> E<00:01:07.190> string<00:01:07.430> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you usually put on the high E string and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.190 
you usually put on the high E string and
the<00:01:07.970> third<00:01:08.180> fret<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> G<00:01:08.810> chord<00:01:09.430> put<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.200> to

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
the third fret for a G chord put it to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.260 
the third fret for a G chord put it to
the<00:01:12.350> B<00:01:12.500> string<00:01:12.560> which<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:13.370> one<00:01:13.700> above<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the B string which is just one above the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.940 
the B string which is just one above the
high<00:01:14.420> E<00:01:14.479> string<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.770> is

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
high E string so it's and so this is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.810 
high E string so it's and so this is
where<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.570> D<00:01:20.570> melody<00:01:20.990> come

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.440 

so<00:01:27.820> basically<00:01:28.300> how<00:01:28.480> it<00:01:28.540> goes<00:01:28.720> it's<00:01:28.870> from<00:01:29.620> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so basically how it goes it's from the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.230 
so basically how it goes it's from the
this<00:01:31.450> has<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.660> cord<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:33.190> then<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.460> pull<00:01:33.850> plug

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
this has a cord and then you pull plug

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.840 
this has a cord and then you pull plug
the<00:01:34.390> IE<00:01:34.600> string<00:01:35.080> under<00:01:35.640> open<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.780> it's

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.600 

and<00:01:41.090> afterwards<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:42.470> lift<00:01:42.800> up<00:01:43.010> your<00:01:43.310> ring

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
and afterwards just lift up your ring

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.770 
and afterwards just lift up your ring
your<00:01:44.120> ring<00:01:44.270> finger<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:45.730> play<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:47.300> B<00:01:47.480> string

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
your ring finger and play the B string

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.990 
your ring finger and play the B string
open<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.970> it's

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.330 

that's<00:01:56.450> how<00:01:56.630> men<00:01:57.260> it<00:01:57.410> goes<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.860> minor

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.149 

so<00:02:02.030> Dallas<00:02:02.780> Green<00:02:02.930> has<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.229> lot<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.470> variations

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
so Dallas Green has a lot of variations

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.510 
so Dallas Green has a lot of variations
for<00:02:04.750> doing<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:05.930> some<00:02:06.229> hammer-ons<00:02:07.040> for<00:02:07.340> as

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
for doing in some hammer-ons for as

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.339 
for doing in some hammer-ons for as
Accords<00:02:08.149> or<00:02:09.130> pull-off<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.459> for<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.450> one<00:02:11.720> I'll

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
Accords or pull-off so for this one I'll

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.710 
Accords or pull-off so for this one I'll
just<00:02:12.500> stick<00:02:12.920> with<00:02:12.980> one<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.810> he<00:02:15.080> does<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:16.720> hammer

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
just stick with one so he does a hammer

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.790 
just stick with one so he does a hammer
on<00:02:17.870> on<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.849> D<00:02:20.150> string<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.410> got

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
on on the on the D string so you got

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.089 
on on the on the D string so you got
your<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:23.120> minor<00:02:23.390> chord<00:02:23.720> your<00:02:24.410> middle<00:02:24.590> finger<00:02:24.950> is

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
your a minor chord your middle finger is

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.380 
your a minor chord your middle finger is
part<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.739> D<00:02:27.739> string<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.220> dope<00:02:28.430> and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
part is on the D string so you dope and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.610 
part is on the D string so you dope and
the<00:02:29.780> open<00:02:30.080> string<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.680> hammer<00:02:31.610> onto<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the open string and hammer onto the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.440 
the open string and hammer onto the
middle<00:02:33.620> finger<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.569> third<00:02:35.569> fret<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.040> it's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
middle finger on the third fret so it's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:51.660 
middle finger on the third fret so it's
any<00:02:38.450> closely

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.150 

that's<00:02:52.670> how<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.750> then<00:02:54.080> after<00:02:54.770> he<00:02:54.950> goes<00:02:55.100> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
that's how you and then after he goes to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.510 
that's how you and then after he goes to
see

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
see

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.020 
see
and<00:02:57.940> afterwards<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.720> my<00:02:59.230> naughty<00:02:59.880> that's<00:03:00.880> what

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and afterwards I my naughty that's what

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.580 
and afterwards I my naughty that's what
I<00:03:01.060> do<00:03:01.210> I<00:03:01.420> don't<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.630> he<00:03:01.840> doesn't<00:03:02.050> like<00:03:02.200> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I do I don't think he doesn't like that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.200 
I do I don't think he doesn't like that
I<00:03:03.160> added<00:03:03.700> pinky<00:03:04.300> on<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:06.430> B<00:03:06.640> string<00:03:07.000> third

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
I added pinky on the the B string third

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:16.140 
I added pinky on the the B string third
fret<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.720> it's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:26.770 

like<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:17.140> far

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:36.390 

so<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.080> bridge<00:03:28.350> is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.149 

all<00:03:36.819> right<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:38.700> first<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.909> a<00:03:40.090> minor<00:03:41.580> an<00:03:42.580> E<00:03:43.090> minor

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
all right so first is a minor an E minor

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.800 
all right so first is a minor an E minor
this<00:03:45.159> one's<00:03:45.549> how<00:03:45.700> about<00:03:45.879> funky<00:03:46.269> gotta<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.629> don't

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
this one's how about funky gotta I don't

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.240 
this one's how about funky gotta I don't
know<00:03:46.870> what<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.140> called<00:03:47.379> so<00:03:47.440> have<00:03:48.129> your

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
know what it's called so have your

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.410 
know what it's called so have your
middle<00:03:48.400> finger<00:03:48.819> on<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:50.040> string<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.879> the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
middle finger on the a string on the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.630 
middle finger on the a string on the
second<00:03:52.810> fret<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.170> your<00:03:53.680> index<00:03:54.069> finger<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.610> the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
second fret and your index finger on the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.780 
second fret and your index finger on the
D<00:03:55.030> string<00:03:55.200> first<00:03:56.200> fret<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.680> then<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.459> ring

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
D string first fret and then your ring

D string first fret and then your ring
finger<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.420> g<00:03:58.810> string<00:03:58.840> on<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.379> second

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
finger on the g string on the second

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:13.650 
finger on the g string on the second
fret<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.670> it's<00:04:07.110> together

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:23.200 

see<00:04:15.070> back<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> pinky<00:04:16.670> bearish<00:04:22.210> sit
