think<00:02:27.420> incidents<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.200> these<00:02:28.500> scare<00:02:29.310> people

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
think incidents like these scare people

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.259 
think incidents like these scare people
away<00:02:29.819> from<00:02:30.390> from<00:02:31.019> shows<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.860> these<00:02:32.310> no<00:02:33.239> I

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
away from from shows like these no I

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.600 
away from from shows like these no I
don't<00:02:33.660> think<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.040> Jack<00:02:35.340> Roush

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
don't think so it's it's like Jack Roush

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.830 
don't think so it's it's like Jack Roush
he's<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> huge<00:02:36.329> NASCAR<00:02:37.579> person<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.750> think

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
he's a huge NASCAR person and I think

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.440 
he's a huge NASCAR person and I think
people<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:41.370> know<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.730> excitement<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.420> there

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
people you know the excitement is there

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.050 
people you know the excitement is there
I<00:02:42.959> don't<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> scares<00:02:44.340> anyone<00:02:44.790> away

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
I don't think it scares anyone away

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.330 
I don't think it scares anyone away
flying<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.109> like<00:02:46.260> any<00:02:46.470> other<00:02:46.650> sport<00:02:47.099> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
flying is just like any other sport it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.479 
flying is just like any other sport it
has<00:02:47.519> its<00:02:47.790> issues<00:02:48.239> from<00:02:48.480> time<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.959> time<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.489> I

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
has its issues from time to time and I

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.039 
has its issues from time to time and I
think<00:02:50.700> people<00:02:51.150> come<00:02:51.359> to<00:02:51.510> see<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> show<00:02:52.019> they

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
think people come to see the show they

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.319 
think people come to see the show they
come<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.920> planes<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.579> unfortunately

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
come to see the planes and unfortunately

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.629 
come to see the planes and unfortunately
when<00:02:54.480> he<00:02:54.510> sings<00:02:54.870> happen<00:02:55.349> they<00:02:55.859> do<00:02:55.920> draw<00:02:56.340> big

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
when he sings happen they do draw big

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.379 
when he sings happen they do draw big
attention<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.739> don't<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.389> it's

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
attention and but I don't think it it's

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.870 
attention and but I don't think it it's
a<00:03:00.540> hazard<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.019> fly<00:03:01.349> it's<00:03:01.889> like<00:03:02.160> anything<00:03:02.549> you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
a hazard to fly it's like anything you

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120 
a hazard to fly it's like anything you
can<00:03:03.030> fall<00:03:03.269> into<00:03:03.510> river<00:03:03.690> fishing<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.440> hurt

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
can fall into river fishing and hurt

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.960 
can fall into river fishing and hurt
yourself<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.780> sport<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.700> got<00:03:08.849> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
