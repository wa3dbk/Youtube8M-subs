00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
like I said before it doesn't replace

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.530 
like I said before it doesn't replace
flossing<00:01:08.890> but<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.490> does<00:01:09.670> help<00:01:09.910> remove<00:01:10.330> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
flossing but it does help remove the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.090 
flossing but it does help remove the
plaque<00:01:10.750> between<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> teeth<00:01:11.560> after<00:01:12.070> brushing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
plaque between the teeth after brushing

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.580 
plaque between the teeth after brushing
and<00:01:12.550> flossing<00:01:12.610> has<00:01:13.060> been<00:01:13.240> done<00:01:13.450> then<00:01:14.380> some

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
and flossing has been done then some

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.859 
and flossing has been done then some
other<00:01:14.710> products<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.490> are<00:01:15.610> very<00:01:15.730> good<00:01:16.030> with

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
other products that are very good with

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.480 
other products that are very good with
rinses<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.650> main<00:01:17.799> ones<00:01:18.009> that<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.250> would

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
rinses and the main ones that I would

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.990 
rinses and the main ones that I would
choose<00:01:18.759> as<00:01:19.409> far<00:01:20.409> as<00:01:20.590> better<00:01:21.310> than<00:01:21.400> other<00:01:21.729> ones

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
choose as far as better than other ones

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.280 
choose as far as better than other ones
would<00:01:22.299> be<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.540> ones<00:01:22.720> without<00:01:22.869> alcohol

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
would be the ones without alcohol

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.980 
would be the ones without alcohol
because<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.610> rinses<00:01:24.970> with<00:01:25.119> alcohol<00:01:25.659> in<00:01:25.810> them

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
because the rinses with alcohol in them

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.679 
because the rinses with alcohol in them
tend<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.409> dry<00:01:26.619> out<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.799> tissues<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:28.479> ones

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
tend to dry out the tissues and the ones

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.660 
tend to dry out the tissues and the ones
without<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.049> alcohol<00:01:29.560> don't<00:01:30.159> do<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.490> and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
without the alcohol don't do that and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.249 
without the alcohol don't do that and
they<00:01:30.729> also<00:01:30.880> don't<00:01:31.149> have<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.479> same<00:01:31.689> burning<00:01:32.140> as

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
they also don't have the same burning as

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.310 
they also don't have the same burning as
the<00:01:32.920> ones<00:01:33.130> with<00:01:33.340> alcohol<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:35.110> there's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
the ones with alcohol and then there's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.560 
the ones with alcohol and then there's
some<00:01:35.530> rinses<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.640> are<00:01:36.970> specifically

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
some rinses that are specifically

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.480 
some rinses that are specifically
designed<00:01:37.720> for<00:01:38.259> patients<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:38.950> dry<00:01:39.280> mouth

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
designed for patients with dry mouth

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.399 
designed for patients with dry mouth

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
there's some patients that have dry

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
to the medications that they're on that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.700 
to the medications that they're on that
cause<00:01:46.210> dry<00:01:46.450> mouth<00:01:46.659> so<00:01:46.899> these<00:01:47.409> can<00:01:47.680> help

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
cause dry mouth so these can help

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.069

promote<00:01:48.340> saliva<00:01:49.210> production<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.899> mouth

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
promote saliva production in the mouth

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.319 
promote saliva production in the mouth
and<00:01:50.320> help<00:01:50.829> keep<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.280> mouth<00:01:51.430> more<00:01:51.729> lubricated

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.810 
and help keep the mouth more lubricated
and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:53.890> one's<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.189> another<00:01:54.670> example

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
and then this one's just another example

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.810 
and then this one's just another example
of<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.689> mouth<00:01:55.930> rinse<00:01:56.229> without<00:01:56.770> any<00:01:57.100> alcohol<00:01:57.670> in
