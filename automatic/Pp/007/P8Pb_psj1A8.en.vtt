00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.000 
motor made and we expect it to be well
over<00:02:19.950> 90%<00:02:20.600> efficient<00:02:21.600> as<00:02:21.750> well<00:02:22.710> as<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
over 90% efficient as well as the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.450 
over 90% efficient as well as the
controller<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.900> batteries<00:02:25.380> are<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
controller for it the batteries are the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.310 
controller for it the batteries are the
the<00:02:26.760> neat<00:02:26.910> thing<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.180> we're<00:02:27.480> developing<00:02:28.080> is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
the neat thing that we're developing is

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.720 
the neat thing that we're developing is
we're<00:02:28.650> developing<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.250> motor<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
we're developing the motor in the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.260 
we're developing the motor in the
controller<00:02:30.120> unit<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:32.000> that's<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
controller unit so that's the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.320 
controller unit so that's the
significant<00:02:33.870> part<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:35.250> battery<00:02:35.640> technology

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
significant part the battery technology

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.670 
significant part the battery technology
can<00:02:36.930> change<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.370> changing<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:40.530> we

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
can change and is is changing so what we

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.710 
can change and is is changing so what we
drive<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.160> motor<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:41.820> battery<00:02:42.390> system

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
drive this motor could be battery system

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.199 
drive this motor could be battery system
it<00:02:42.840> could<00:02:42.990> be<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> fuel<00:02:43.410> cell<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.030> pretty

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
it could be a fuel cell it's a pretty

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.900 
it could be a fuel cell it's a pretty
lethal<00:02:45.480> pack<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> gas<00:02:47.400> tank<00:02:47.700> full<00:02:47.850> of

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
lethal pack but so is a gas tank full of

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.770 
lethal pack but so is a gas tank full of
gas<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.950> treat<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.459> same<00:02:50.780> so

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
gas so we have to treat it the same so

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.830 
gas so we have to treat it the same so
we<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:51.989> 10<00:02:52.200> battery<00:02:52.590> packs<00:02:52.860> each<00:02:53.790> pack<00:02:54.180> each

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
we have 10 battery packs each pack each

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.770 
we have 10 battery packs each pack each
separate<00:02:55.620> battery<00:02:55.980> container<00:02:56.550> has<00:02:56.970> eight

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
separate battery container has eight

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.860 
separate battery container has eight
packs<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.680> 10<00:02:59.160> cells<00:02:59.580> so<00:02:59.940> there's<00:03:00.150> 800<00:03:00.360> cells

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
packs of 10 cells so there's 800 cells

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
packs of 10 cells so there's 800 cells
all<00:03:01.080> together<00:03:01.350> all<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.489> which<00:03:02.610> have<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.880> be

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
all together all of which have to be

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.440 
all together all of which have to be
monitored<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.730> particularly<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.000> charging

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
monitored and particularly in a charging

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.780 
monitored and particularly in a charging
cycle<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.980> discharge<00:03:08.400> cycle<00:03:08.730> is

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
cycle and then in a discharge cycle is

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.960 
cycle and then in a discharge cycle is
not<00:03:08.880> as<00:03:09.239> big<00:03:09.450> an<00:03:09.570> issue<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:11.160> as<00:03:11.310> were<00:03:11.640> using

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
not as big an issue but we as were using

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.870 
not as big an issue but we as were using
some<00:03:12.180> very<00:03:12.570> efficient<00:03:13.110> cells<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.670> most

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
some very efficient cells the most

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.270 
some very efficient cells the most
efficient<00:03:15.300> cells<00:03:15.630> available<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.650> now<00:03:16.709> and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
efficient cells available right now and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.289 
efficient cells available right now and
newer<00:03:18.030> ones<00:03:18.330> are<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> way<00:03:18.810> as<00:03:18.930> we<00:03:19.080> speak<00:03:19.110> so

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
newer ones are on the way as we speak so

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.449 
newer ones are on the way as we speak so
we're<00:03:21.299> that's<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.049> big<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.769> big<00:03:22.799> thrust<00:03:23.160> now

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
we're that's the big the big thrust now

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.990 
we're that's the big the big thrust now
is<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.790> use<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.630> airplane<00:03:25.940> as<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
is to use this airplane as a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.550 
is to use this airplane as a
demonstrator<00:03:27.720> since<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> proven

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
demonstrator since we have a proven

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.870 
demonstrator since we have a proven
airframe<00:03:29.780> as<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.840> demonstrator<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:32.280> show<00:03:32.519> what

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
airframe as a demonstrator to show what

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.509 
airframe as a demonstrator to show what
we<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.390> with<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> motor<00:03:35.250> is

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
we can do with it and then the motor is

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.660 
we can do with it and then the motor is
completely<00:03:36.150> scalable<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.989> motor<00:03:37.230> system<00:03:37.670> so

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
completely scalable the motor system so

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.750 
completely scalable the motor system so
that<00:03:38.910> in<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.239> near<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.700> not-too-distant<00:03:41.700> future

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that in a near in not-too-distant future

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.570 
that in a near in not-too-distant future
we<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:42.870> design<00:03:43.170> an<00:03:43.350> airframe<00:03:43.680> specifically

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
we can design an airframe specifically

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.270 
we can design an airframe specifically
for<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> system<00:03:45.560> if<00:03:46.560> we<00:03:46.620> wanted<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.130> make<00:03:47.250> it

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
for the system if we wanted to make it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.949 
for the system if we wanted to make it
twice<00:03:47.610> as<00:03:47.820> powerful<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.390> just<00:03:48.570> twice<00:03:48.750> as

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
twice as powerful it's just twice as

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.160 
twice as powerful it's just twice as
