number so you need to find out some
surface<00:01:10.140> whether<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.159> flat<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
surface whether it's flat and then you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
surface whether it's flat and then you
just<00:01:15.420> checked<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.369> it's<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.630> 150<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.140> in

just checked it it's about 150 and in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.820 
just checked it it's about 150 and in
between<00:01:19.790> 150<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.820> 200<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.500> say

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

roughly 170 or 175 okay now you got the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.950 
roughly 170 or 175 okay now you got the
numbers<00:01:28.040> okay<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.630> need<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
numbers okay and then you you need to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:43.260 
numbers okay and then you you need to
dunk<00:01:31.170> it
