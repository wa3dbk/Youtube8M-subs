idea<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.110> our<00:00:22.260> project<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.240> expand<00:00:24.240> their

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
idea of our project was to expand their

arm<00:01:40.670> but<00:01:41.600> we<00:01:41.690> also<00:01:41.869> wanted<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.320> have<00:01:42.590> an

ultimate way of mounting by using this
plate<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.070> straps<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.840> system<00:01:48.140> can

now I want to show you a demonstration

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.389 
now I want to show you a demonstration
of<00:02:01.719> how<00:02:01.929> the<00:02:01.990> mechanism<00:02:02.619> works<00:02:02.649> with<00:02:03.280> the

of how the mechanism works with the
LabVIEW<00:02:03.609> program<00:02:04.329> first<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.229> have<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
LabVIEW program first we have to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.490 
LabVIEW program first we have to
activate<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> solenoid<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.840> turn<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.379> the

activate the solenoid and turn on the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.150 
activate the solenoid and turn on the
motors<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.660> they're<00:02:10.899> not<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.890> number<00:02:12.129> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160

million<00:02:38.500> 54<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.549> my<00:02:39.790> review<00:02:40.000> now<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.989> start<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
million 54 to my review now we start the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.610 
million 54 to my review now we start the
scanning<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:43.299> as<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.660> can<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:45.099> solenoid

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
scanning and as you can see the solenoid

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.259 
scanning and as you can see the solenoid
initializes<00:02:47.620> itself<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.579> first<00:02:48.970> motor

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
initializes itself and this first motor

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.199 
initializes itself and this first motor
starts<00:02:49.660> -<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:51.340> when<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:53.130> travels<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
starts - then when it travels to the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.839 
starts - then when it travels to the
total<00:02:55.870> travel<00:02:56.079> which<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:56.799> second<00:02:57.700> one

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
total travel which you think second one

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.789 
total travel which you think second one
moves<00:02:58.269> one<00:02:58.569> step<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:59.079> do<00:02:59.230> quite<00:02:59.500> rich<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:00.010> this

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
moves one step to do quite rich and this

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.240 
moves one step to do quite rich and this
process<00:03:03.959> repeats<00:03:04.959> itself<00:03:05.319> until<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.829> covers

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
process repeats itself until it covers

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.879 
process repeats itself until it covers
the<00:03:06.549> whole<00:03:06.730> area<00:03:07.030> now<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.609> started<00:03:10.590> skating<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
the whole area now I started skating and

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.720 
the whole area now I started skating and
I<00:03:12.430> want<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.389> go<00:03:13.600> back<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.230> composition<00:03:14.859> now

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
I want to go back to the composition now

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.819 
I want to go back to the composition now
you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:16.120> see<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.720> first<00:03:16.959> one<00:03:17.170> moves<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.739> its

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
you can see the first one moves to its

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:18.870 
you can see the first one moves to its
original<00:03:17.980> position

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
original position

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.879 
original position
the<00:03:19.000> second<00:03:19.510> word<00:03:19.660> used<00:03:20.200> its<00:03:20.440> original

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
the second word used its original

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.330 
the second word used its original
position<00:03:21.040> now<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.150> want<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.540> change<00:03:23.079> either<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
position now I want to change either the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.720 
position now I want to change either the
value<00:03:25.060> value<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:26.319> example<00:03:26.410> if<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.459> run

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
value value for example if you can run

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.910 
value value for example if you can run
them<00:03:27.910> orders<00:03:28.299> much<00:03:28.810> faster<00:03:29.349> than<00:03:29.500> what<00:03:29.739> you

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
them orders much faster than what you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.620 
them orders much faster than what you
saw<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.489> first<00:03:30.670> illustration<00:03:31.239> for

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
saw in the first illustration for

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.670 
saw in the first illustration for
example<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.260> change<00:03:32.859> this<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:34.349> another<00:03:35.349> about

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
example I change this to another about

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.120 
example I change this to another about
it<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:37.030> change<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.380> delay<00:03:38.709> between<00:03:38.920> each

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
it and I change the delay between each

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.990 
it and I change the delay between each
point<00:03:39.549> from<00:03:40.060> one<00:03:40.389> second<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.160> opposite<00:03:42.160> now<00:03:42.970> I

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
point from one second to opposite now I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.349 
point from one second to opposite now I
do<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.989> scanning<00:03:44.349> again<00:03:44.880> as<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.060> can<00:03:46.239> see

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
do the scanning again as you can see

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.069 
do the scanning again as you can see
again<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:47.169> sauna<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:48.190> try<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.519> sell<00:03:48.880> as<00:03:49.540> much

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
again the sauna you try to sell as much

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.140 
again the sauna you try to sell as much
possible<00:03:50.440> as<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:51.220> can<00:03:51.370> see<00:03:51.519> when<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> flow<00:03:52.000> is

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
possible as you can see when the flow is

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.099 
possible as you can see when the flow is
down<00:03:52.389> is<00:03:52.810> when<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.590> scandal<00:03:54.010> occurs<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.840> can

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
down is when the scandal occurs this can

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.410 
down is when the scandal occurs this can
just

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.930 
just
state<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.020> total<00:03:58.319> traveled<00:03:58.980> much<00:03:59.490> much

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
state the total traveled much much

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.370 
state the total traveled much much
quicker<00:04:01.220> thank<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:05.630> our<00:04:06.630> system<00:04:07.020> is<00:04:07.170> now

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
quicker thank you our system is now

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.000 
quicker thank you our system is now
ready<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.950> used<00:04:08.069> in<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.520> clinic<00:04:08.730> for
