00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.109 

very<00:00:19.050> very<00:00:19.350> popularize<00:00:20.160> done<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.330> many<00:00:21.570> ways

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
very very popularize done in many ways

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
very very popularize done in many ways
we<00:00:24.119> are<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> easiest<00:00:25.290> way

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we are going to do it the easiest way

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.350 
we are going to do it the easiest way
one<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.410> without<00:00:28.410> difficulty<00:00:29.360> just

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
one can do it without difficulty just

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.390 
one can do it without difficulty just
requires<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> few<00:00:31.170> things<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.680> that<00:00:31.890> trick

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
requires a few things and that trick

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.010 
requires a few things and that trick
alright<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.270> ready

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.069 

so<00:00:40.530> first<00:00:40.920> step<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:42.420> pound<00:00:43.579> garlic<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.079> red

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so first step is to pound garlic and red

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.259 
so first step is to pound garlic and red
chilies<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.640> pound<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
chilies well you can pound it

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.270 
chilies well you can pound it
temperature<00:00:48.840> use<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.290> as<00:00:49.470> a<00:00:49.530> chili<00:00:49.829> powders

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
temperature use it as a chili powders

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.299 
temperature use it as a chili powders
but<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.360> gives<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> better<00:00:51.960> taste

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
but I think this gives you better taste

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
but I think this gives you better taste
so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.489> am<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> pound<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> call<00:00:54.780> sleep

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so I am going to pound it call sleep

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.130 
so I am going to pound it call sleep

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
remember coarsely not a paste so it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.160 
remember coarsely not a paste so it's
going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.650> on<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.579> edge<00:00:59.760> okay<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.079> I'm
