00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
animations later on and I've already

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.439 
animations later on and I've already
made<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.199> selection<00:00:22.470> set<00:00:22.949> control<00:00:23.820> f1<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> bring

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
made a selection set control f1 to bring

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.750 
made a selection set control f1 to bring
up<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> scene<00:00:24.900> editor<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.859> West<00:00:26.430> election

up the scene editor and West election

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.339 
up the scene editor and West election
set<00:00:26.939> does<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.240> give<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.539> an<00:00:27.660> easy<00:00:27.840> way<00:00:27.960> to

set does is give you an easy way to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
set does is give you an easy way to
select<00:00:29.099> items<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.090> example<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.570> wanted<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
select items so for example I wanted to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.190 
select items so for example I wanted to
be<00:00:31.320> able<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.590> select<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.610> bones<00:00:33.170> here<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
be able to select all the bones here and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260 
be able to select all the bones here and
hit<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.710> tail<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> comes<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.370> his<00:00:35.489> head<00:00:35.670> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
hit the tail that comes out his head so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.260 
hit the tail that comes out his head so
I'm<00:00:36.420> already<00:00:36.600> created<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.140> selection<00:00:37.440> set<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
I'm already created a selection set and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
I'm already created a selection set and
it's<00:00:39.270> cold<00:00:39.480> tail<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> selected<00:00:40.680> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it's cold tail and when I selected that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.680 
it's cold tail and when I selected that
selects<00:00:41.460> those<00:00:41.670> items<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.210> me<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.450> no<00:00:42.600> matter

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
selects those items for me so no matter

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.150 
selects those items for me so no matter
where<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> am<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> scene<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:44.010> else

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
where I am in the scene what else

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.729 
where I am in the scene what else
selected<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.120> easily<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.899> those<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
selected I can easily get to those and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.209 
selected I can easily get to those and
as<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.660> expands<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.219> higher

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
as you can see it expands the higher

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.709 
as you can see it expands the higher
gear<00:00:50.610> hierarchy<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.739> see

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
gear hierarchy here so that you can see

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.930 
gear hierarchy here so that you can see
you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.070> selected<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
you can see them selected in the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
you can see them selected in the
viewport<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.109> example<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
viewport so for example if I want to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.490 
viewport so for example if I want to
create<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> new<00:00:59.039> set<00:00:59.870> here's<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.320> do

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
create a new set here's how it would do

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.139 
create a new set here's how it would do
it<00:01:01.649> unfortunately<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> can't<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> by

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it unfortunately you can't do it by

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
it unfortunately you can't do it by
selecting<00:01:03.300> items<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> viewport<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:05.010> try

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
selecting items in the viewport if I try

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
selecting items in the viewport if I try
to<00:01:05.250> save<00:01:05.580> these<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> save

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
to save these here is go to save

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
to save these here is go to save
selection<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.189> say<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.760> selection

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
selection it will say that the selection

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.609 
selection it will say that the selection
is<00:01:09.330> saved<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> select<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
is saved but when you go to select it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
is saved but when you go to select it
later<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
later it will not actually do it so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
later it will not actually do it so
let's<00:01:12.900> say<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> select<00:01:13.530> um<00:01:15.140> let's<00:01:16.140> say

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
let's say I want to select um let's say

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
let's say I want to select um let's say
I<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> select<00:01:16.710> everything<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.670> hand

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I want to select everything in this hand

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.310 
I want to select everything in this hand
here<00:01:19.549> let's<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> expand<00:01:21.689> his<00:01:22.020> entire

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
here let's go and expand his entire

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
here let's go and expand his entire
hierarchy<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> right<00:01:23.850> click<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
hierarchy go to right click and go to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
hierarchy go to right click and go to
expand<00:01:24.990> child<00:01:25.259> items<00:01:25.590> recursive<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
expand child items recursive so the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.679 
expand child items recursive so the
entire<00:01:27.479> hierarchy<00:01:27.810> has<00:01:28.259> been<00:01:28.290> displayed<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
entire hierarchy has been displayed and

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.319 
entire hierarchy has been displayed and
let's<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.470> our<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:33.150> hand

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
let's see I think that's our right hand

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
let's see I think that's our right hand
so<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> save<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.579> our<00:01:36.829> hand<00:01:38.390> so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so I'm going to save that as our hand so

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.820 
so I'm going to save that as our hand so
now<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:40.320> i<00:01:40.350> select<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.340> select<00:01:41.579> tail

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
now when i select i can select tail

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.040 
now when i select i can select tail
we<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.640> proved<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.900> is

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
we just proved to you that it is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.800 
we just proved to you that it is
selecting<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.300> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
selecting it and so as you can see it's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
selecting it and so as you can see it's
an<00:01:48.960> easy<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.650> select<00:01:50.310> different<00:01:50.430> items

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
an easy way to select different items

fighting<00:03:44.050> now<00:03:45.050> that<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.470> object<00:03:45.650> here<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.280> a

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
fighting now that this object here is a

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.750 
fighting now that this object here is a
collision<00:03:47.240> detection<00:03:47.570> object<00:03:48.459> we<00:03:49.459> can<00:03:49.610> worry

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
collision detection object we can worry

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.930 
collision detection object we can worry
about<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.940> later<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:51.580> as<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.700> can<00:03:52.760> see

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
about that later but as you can see

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.900 
about that later but as you can see
there<00:03:53.150> they're<00:03:53.570> fighting<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.080> stuff<00:03:54.910> and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
there they're fighting and stuff and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.699 
there they're fighting and stuff and
you'll<00:03:56.090> notice<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:57.020> put<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.380> lens<00:03:57.560> flare

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
you'll notice that I put a lens flare

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.949 
you'll notice that I put a lens flare
here<00:03:58.070> whenever<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.580> lightsabers<00:03:59.420> clashed<00:03:59.660> to

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
here whenever the lightsabers clashed to

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.590 
here whenever the lightsabers clashed to
accentuate<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:01.520> clash<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.030> lightsabers

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
accentuate the clash of the lightsabers

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.760 
accentuate the clash of the lightsabers
and<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:05.690> way<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.870> can<00:04:06.080> get<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.320> too<00:04:06.470> if

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
and the way you can get that too if

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.860 
and the way you can get that too if
that's<00:04:07.100> not<00:04:07.250> showing<00:04:07.850> up<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.180> your<00:04:08.420> viewport

card<00:04:25.250> can't<00:04:25.669> handle<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.120> okay<00:04:27.580> but<00:04:28.580> what<00:04:28.700> I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
card can't handle it okay but what I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.710 
card can't handle it okay but what I
want<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.000> actually<00:04:29.150> show<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:29.450> about<00:04:29.630> this

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
want to actually show you about this

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.990 
want to actually show you about this
scene<00:04:29.930> is<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.470> found<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.130> tip<00:04:31.340> if<00:04:31.520> you're

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
scene is I found a tip if you're

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.180 
scene is I found a tip if you're
animating<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.750> sword<00:04:33.260> fighting<00:04:33.470> sequence<00:04:34.010> or

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
animating a sword fighting sequence or

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.790 
animating a sword fighting sequence or
really<00:04:35.090> just<00:04:35.840> about<00:04:35.930> any<00:04:36.169> kind<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.410> sequence

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
really just about any kind of sequence

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.550 
really just about any kind of sequence
which<00:04:37.729> is<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.840> want<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.080> keep<00:04:39.260> track<00:04:39.500> of

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
which is that you want to keep track of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.330 
which is that you want to keep track of
an<00:04:39.890> arc<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:41.419> an<00:04:41.750> item<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.530> motion<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.040> doing

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
an arc that an item in motion is doing

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.100 
an arc that an item in motion is doing
and<00:04:43.550> what<00:04:43.700> I<00:04:43.729> found<00:04:43.910> out<00:04:44.060> was<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.750> animators

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
and what I found out was the animators

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.540 
and what I found out was the animators
island<00:04:45.560> when<00:04:45.680> they<00:04:45.770> were<00:04:45.830> animating<00:04:46.310> Yoda

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
island when they were animating Yoda

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.880 
island when they were animating Yoda
fighting<00:04:47.510> with<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.750> lightsaber<00:04:47.900> they<00:04:48.620> attached

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
fighting with a lightsaber they attached

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.340 
fighting with a lightsaber they attached
a<00:04:49.010> null<00:04:49.190> object<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.780> end<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:50.990> his<00:04:51.110> sword

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
a null object to the end of his sword

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.370 
a null object to the end of his sword
and<00:04:51.620> track<00:04:51.890> that<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.520> show<00:04:52.900> where<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.110> Ark<00:04:54.260> of

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
and track that to show where the Ark of

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.140 
and track that to show where the Ark of
the<00:04:54.470> sword<00:04:54.710> was<00:04:54.860> going<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.820> I've<00:04:55.970> done

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
the sword was going and so I've done

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.080 
the sword was going and so I've done
that<00:04:56.330> I've<00:04:56.570> selected<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.530> null<00:04:57.860> object<00:04:58.280> called

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
that I've selected a null object called

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.560 
that I've selected a null object called
Vader<00:04:59.330> sword<00:04:59.660> tip<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:01.280> if<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.490> go<00:05:01.640> in<00:05:01.820> here<00:05:02.090> it's

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
Vader sword tip so if we go in here it's

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.020 
Vader sword tip so if we go in here it's
coming<00:05:02.900> hard<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.140> see<00:05:03.370> let<00:05:04.370> me<00:05:04.490> let<00:05:04.850> me<00:05:04.910> go

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
coming hard to see let me let me go

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.959 
coming hard to see let me let me go
ahead<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:07.450> hide

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
ahead and hide

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.329 
ahead and hide
or<00:05:10.569> just<00:05:10.749> bounding<00:05:11.229> box<00:05:11.439> the<00:05:11.799> throne<00:05:12.189> room

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:12.339 
or just bounding box the throne room

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.789 
or just bounding box the throne room
there<00:05:12.489> so<00:05:12.669> it's<00:05:12.819> easier<00:05:13.149> to<00:05:13.329> to<00:05:13.659> make<00:05:13.839> out<00:05:14.049> now

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:14.799 
there so it's easier to to make out now

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:18.419 
there so it's easier to to make out now
let's<00:05:14.979> go<00:05:15.219> to<00:05:15.279> that<00:05:15.909> and<00:05:16.479> as<00:05:17.469> you<00:05:17.619> can<00:05:17.709> see<00:05:17.739> when

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:18.429 
let's go to that and as you can see when

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:20.459 
let's go to that and as you can see when
whenever<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:18.909> select<00:05:19.089> an<00:05:19.329> item<00:05:19.479> in<00:05:19.989> lightwave

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
whenever you select an item in lightwave

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.089 
whenever you select an item in lightwave
by<00:05:20.949> default<00:05:21.249> it<00:05:21.519> will<00:05:21.639> draw<00:05:22.179> the<00:05:22.209> motion<00:05:22.629> path

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
by default it will draw the motion path

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.909 
by default it will draw the motion path
so<00:05:24.099> i<00:05:24.399> can<00:05:24.639> i<00:05:24.909> can<00:05:25.059> see<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.749> the<00:05:26.379> arc<00:05:26.559> for

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
so i can i can see the the arc for

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.619 
so i can i can see the the arc for
example<00:05:27.189> i<00:05:27.249> can<00:05:27.369> see<00:05:27.549> right<00:05:27.699> here<00:05:27.939> the<00:05:28.479> arc

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
example i can see right here the arc

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.059 
example i can see right here the arc
that<00:05:28.779> the<00:05:28.929> sword<00:05:29.169> is<00:05:29.349> going<00:05:29.619> through<00:05:29.799> when<00:05:29.979> he

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
that the sword is going through when he

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.959 
that the sword is going through when he
goes<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.639> swing<00:05:30.969> over<00:05:31.119> his<00:05:31.329> head<00:05:31.389> like<00:05:31.599> that<00:05:31.629> um

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
goes to swing over his head like that um

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.249 
goes to swing over his head like that um
but<00:05:33.969> the<00:05:34.239> problem<00:05:34.389> is<00:05:34.629> that<00:05:34.659> lets<00:05:35.049> say<00:05:35.169> i

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
but the problem is that lets say i

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.289

Vader sort tip again and hit p and it's
called<00:05:50.349> draw<00:05:50.529> motion<00:05:50.919> path<00:05:51.099> and<00:05:51.429> when<00:05:52.119> i<00:05:52.149> turn

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
called draw motion path and when i turn

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.109 
called draw motion path and when i turn
it<00:05:52.539> on<00:05:52.689> as<00:05:53.099> you<00:05:54.099> can<00:05:54.159> see<00:05:54.399> it<00:05:54.639> will<00:05:54.819> draw<00:05:55.089> the
