into<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.590> details<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:15.150> piece<00:00:15.990> here

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
into the details of this piece here
that's<00:00:17.220> why<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> would<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.730> taking<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> camera

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that's why I would be taking the camera

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.109 
that's why I would be taking the camera
further<00:00:19.260> down<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.039> would<00:00:20.189> swim<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.000> we

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
further down and I would swim in so we

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.970 
further down and I would swim in so we
have<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.539> nice<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.859> close<00:00:23.160> look<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.029> this
