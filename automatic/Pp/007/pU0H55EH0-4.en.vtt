00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
hey guys Shane H here I did a little bit

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.740 
hey guys Shane H here I did a little bit
of<00:00:11.990> mellow<00:00:12.170> Tecton<00:00:12.670> last<00:00:13.670> Saturday<00:00:14.300> I<00:00:14.570> would

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
of mellow Tecton last Saturday I would

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.190 
of mellow Tecton last Saturday I would
have<00:00:14.840> been<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:16.700> thirteenth<00:00:17.240> didn't<00:00:17.779> find<00:00:17.990> too

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
have been the thirteenth didn't find too

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.519 
have been the thirteenth didn't find too
much<00:00:18.349> of<00:00:18.529> anything<00:00:18.770> I<00:00:19.250> did<00:00:20.150> fail<00:00:20.989> him<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.230> target

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
much of anything I did fail him a target

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.339 
much of anything I did fail him a target
that<00:00:21.919> thought<00:00:22.640> was<00:00:22.820> probably<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.840> coin<00:00:24.079> it<00:00:24.259> was

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
that thought was probably a coin it was

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.909 
that thought was probably a coin it was
a<00:00:24.410> nice<00:00:24.590> steady<00:00:25.430> signal<00:00:26.169> thought<00:00:27.169> maybe<00:00:27.380> six

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
a nice steady signal thought maybe six

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.359 
a nice steady signal thought maybe six
inches<00:00:28.099> at<00:00:28.550> most<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:30.140> turned<00:00:30.439> out<00:00:30.619> to<00:00:30.800> be<00:00:30.829> a<00:00:30.950> at

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
inches at most it turned out to be a at

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.150 
inches at most it turned out to be a at
least<00:00:31.610> 13<00:00:32.060> inches<00:00:32.360> or<00:00:32.540> more<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.899> I<00:00:33.140> did<00:00:33.890> film

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
least 13 inches or more and I did film

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.940 
least 13 inches or more and I did film
it<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:34.399> I'm<00:00:34.610> gonna<00:00:34.730> show<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.180> guys<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:36.620> after

it so I'm gonna show you guys that after
I<00:00:37.250> show<00:00:37.580> you<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.090> settings<00:00:38.330> I'm<00:00:38.630> running<00:00:39.050> the

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
I show you the settings I'm running the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.850 
I show you the settings I'm running the
Fisher's<00:00:39.530> have<00:00:39.770> 70<00:00:40.400> yet<00:00:41.170> so<00:00:42.170> I'm<00:00:42.290> gonna<00:00:42.410> turn

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
Fisher's have 70 yet so I'm gonna turn

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.260 
Fisher's have 70 yet so I'm gonna turn
on<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:43.100> metal<00:00:43.400> detector

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.390 

I<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> sound<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.740> way<00:00:52.830> down<00:00:53.040> because

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
I have to sound all the way down because

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.550 
I have to sound all the way down because
it's<00:00:53.550> picking<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.630> lot<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:54.930> stuff<00:00:55.170> does<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
it's picking up a lot of stuff does it

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.770 
it's picking up a lot of stuff does it
have<00:00:55.830> it<00:00:55.950> inside<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.530> yeah<00:00:58.970> so<00:00:59.970> we're<00:01:00.690> gonna

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
have it inside and yeah so we're gonna

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.520 
have it inside and yeah so we're gonna
start<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.410> discrimination<00:01:02.400> level<00:01:02.970> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
start with the discrimination level I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.030 
start with the discrimination level I
like<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.830> run<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.220> low<00:01:05.550> as<00:01:05.760> possible<00:01:05.810> just

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
like to run it as low as possible just

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.240 
like to run it as low as possible just
because<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.400> hire<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.660> run<00:01:09.870> it<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.250> less

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
because I hire you you run it to less

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
because I hire you you run it to less
sensitivity<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.300> start<00:01:12.540> losing<00:01:12.660> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
sensitivity you get you start losing a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.880 
sensitivity you get you start losing a
lot<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.080> targets<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.260> six<00:01:16.260> seems<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.740> work

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
lot of targets so six seems to work

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
lot of targets so six seems to work
quite<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.280> getting<00:01:18.270> rid<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> most<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
quite well getting rid of most of the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
quite well getting rid of most of the
nails<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.590> still<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:20.119> rusty<00:01:21.119> nails<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.660> that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
nails you still get rusty nails and that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.560 
nails you still get rusty nails and that
kind<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.260> stuff<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.440> speed<00:01:25.440> is<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:26.040> on

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
kind of stuff and speed is gonna be on

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
kind of stuff and speed is gonna be on
default<00:01:28.310> never<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.580> got<00:01:29.729> into<00:01:30.090> playing

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
default never really got into playing

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.830 
default never really got into playing
with<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> lower<00:01:32.460> speed<00:01:32.910> setting

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.330 

sensitivities<00:01:37.520> 87<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.110> found<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.830> fish

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sensitivities 87 and I found it the fish

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.170 
sensitivities 87 and I found it the fish
you<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.520> 70<00:01:41.940> runs<00:01:42.290> really<00:01:43.290> good<00:01:43.410> at<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
you have 70 runs really good at this

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.650 
you have 70 runs really good at this
sensitivity<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.790> run<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.440> edge<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
sensitivity and I run it at the edge of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.300 
sensitivity and I run it at the edge of
being<00:01:51.660> too<00:01:51.960> noisy<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:54.440> so<00:01:55.440> that's<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.160> way

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
being too noisy and so that's just a way

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.840 
being too noisy and so that's just a way
to<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.700> run<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:58.429> threshold<00:01:59.429> negative

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to like to run it threshold negative

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.719 
to like to run it threshold negative
three<00:02:01.580> number<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.729> tones<00:02:02.910> 2f<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> hear

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
three number of tones 2f I like to hear

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.309 
three number of tones 2f I like to hear
all<00:02:05.729> kinds<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.119> different<00:02:06.300> sounds<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
all kinds of different sounds so you

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.999 
all kinds of different sounds so you
know<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.470> like<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.039> iron<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.709> my<00:02:10.709> coins

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
know I like here my iron and my coins

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.949 
know I like here my iron and my coins
and<00:02:11.310> my<00:02:11.400> good<00:02:11.580> stuff<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.640> notch<00:02:15.090> ins<00:02:15.420> gonna<00:02:15.780> be

and my good stuff and notch ins gonna be

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.650 
and my good stuff and notch ins gonna be
one<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.970> how<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> run<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.630> Fisher<00:02:19.050> f70
