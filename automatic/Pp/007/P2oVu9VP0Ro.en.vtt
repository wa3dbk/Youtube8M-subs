well it's actually really good quality
gonna<00:03:14.220> make<00:03:14.459> sure<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.790> was<00:03:14.880> not<00:03:14.970> very<00:03:15.180> good

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
gonna make sure that was not very good

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.870 
gonna make sure that was not very good
but<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:15.990> work<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.320> later<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:17.730> now

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
but I can work on that later so for now

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.420 
but I can work on that later so for now
that's<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.440> good<00:03:19.709> enough<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.130> then

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's that that's good enough so then

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.650 
that's that that's good enough so then
after<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.760> what<00:03:21.000> you're<00:03:21.090> gonna<00:03:21.330> do<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.510> find

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
after that what you're gonna do is find

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.330 
after that what you're gonna do is find
the<00:03:21.870> gameplay<00:03:22.260> footage<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.890> recorded

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the gameplay footage that you recorded

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.940 
the gameplay footage that you recorded
at<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.760> same<00:03:23.940> time<00:03:24.150> simultaneously<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:25.110> am

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
at the same time simultaneously I am

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.500 
at the same time simultaneously I am
didn't<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:26.580> any<00:03:26.790> gameplay<00:03:27.000> footage<00:03:27.300> at<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
didn't do any gameplay footage at the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.460 
didn't do any gameplay footage at the
same<00:03:27.630> time<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.050> gonna<00:03:28.140> go<00:03:28.290> ahead<00:03:28.350> and

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
same time so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.380 
same time so I'm just gonna go ahead and
drag<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.860> drop<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.160> random<00:03:29.580> ARMA<00:03:29.880> 2<00:03:30.030> footage

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
drag and drop this random ARMA 2 footage

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.040 
drag and drop this random ARMA 2 footage
into<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.700> folder<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.060> what<00:03:33.390> you'll<00:03:33.540> notice<00:03:33.660> is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
into the folder so what you'll notice is

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.360 
into the folder so what you'll notice is
that<00:03:34.110> as<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.739> play<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:36.630> won't<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.900> able<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
that as you play it you won't be able to

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.190 
that as you play it you won't be able to
draw<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.760> footage<00:03:39.090> that's<00:03:39.480> underneath<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.080> it

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
draw the footage that's underneath of it

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.930 
draw the footage that's underneath of it
but<00:03:40.440> you'll<00:03:40.560> be<00:03:40.620> able<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.830> hear<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.130> because

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
but you'll be able to hear it because

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.890 
but you'll be able to hear it because
you<00:03:42.060> probably<00:03:42.239> might<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.570> heard<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.780> there

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
you probably might have heard it there

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.270 
you probably might have heard it there
my<00:03:43.019> system<00:03:43.440> audio<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.739> really<00:03:43.920> low<00:03:44.040> but

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
my system audio is really low but

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.530 
my system audio is really low but
whatever<00:03:44.519> you'll<00:03:44.730> be<00:03:44.820> able<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.000> hear<00:03:45.150> both<00:03:45.390> of

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
whatever you'll be able to hear both of

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.610 
whatever you'll be able to hear both of
them<00:03:45.660> at<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> same<00:03:45.810> time<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.230> you'll<00:03:46.380> still

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
them at the same time but you'll still

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.800 
them at the same time but you'll still
right<00:03:46.830> now<00:03:46.950> only<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.370> able<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.610> see<00:03:48.060> in<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
right now only be able to see in the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.720 
right now only be able to see in the
preview<00:03:49.170> you'll<00:03:49.980> only<00:03:50.220> be<00:03:50.370> able<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.519> see<00:03:50.640> your

preview you'll only be able to see your

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.370 
preview you'll only be able to see your
webcam<00:03:51.060> footage<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.510> fix<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.750> what<00:03:52.290> we're

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
webcam footage so to fix that what we're

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.979 
webcam footage so to fix that what we're
gonna<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.769> go<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.310> event<00:03:54.120> pan<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.720> crop

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
gonna do is go to the event pan and crop

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.350 
gonna do is go to the event pan and crop
menu<00:03:55.320> or<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.800> equivalent<00:03:56.070> of<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.820> any

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
menu or the equivalent of this in any

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.870 
menu or the equivalent of this in any
other<00:03:57.570> editing<00:03:57.959> program<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.350> you're<00:03:58.470> using

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
other editing program that you're using

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.180 
other editing program that you're using
go<00:03:59.880> ahead<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.300> drop<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.810> zoom<00:04:01.019> down<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.560> 0<00:04:01.830> so

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
go ahead and drop the zoom down to 0 so

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.800 
go ahead and drop the zoom down to 0 so
that<00:04:02.220> we<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.550> see<00:04:02.760> everything<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.570> here

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that we can see everything going on here

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.810 
that we can see everything going on here
and<00:04:04.739> make<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.100> little<00:04:05.220> bigger<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.610> it's

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
and make this a little bigger so it's

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.330 
and make this a little bigger so it's
easier<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.150> work<00:04:06.300> with<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.660> but<00:04:07.290> first<00:04:08.100> step

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
easier to work with it but first step

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.920 
easier to work with it but first step
what<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.850> got<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.440> expand<00:04:10.820> this<00:04:11.930> here

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
what you got to do is expand this here

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.539 
what you got to do is expand this here
which<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.470> effectively<00:04:14.010> making<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.430> web

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
which this is effectively making the web

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.330 
which this is effectively making the web
cam<00:04:14.730> footage<00:04:14.910> smaller<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.570> smaller<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.380> so

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
cam footage smaller and smaller and so

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.759 
cam footage smaller and smaller and so
you<00:04:17.489> expand<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.229> size<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.470> you

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
you expand that to the size that you

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.400 
you expand that to the size that you
want<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.310> be<00:04:20.459> at<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:21.690> if<00:04:21.900> we<00:04:21.989> make<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.229> that

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
want it to be at so if we make it that

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.659 
want it to be at so if we make it that
large<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:22.919> look<00:04:23.039> over<00:04:23.190> here<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.520> now

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
large and we look over here it's now

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.970 
large and we look over here it's now
made<00:04:23.910> my<00:04:24.000> web<00:04:24.180> cam<00:04:24.390> footage<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:24.840> small<00:04:25.169> so

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
made my web cam footage that small so

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.770 
made my web cam footage that small so
probably<00:04:26.760> want<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.910> go<00:04:27.030> ahead<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.450> make<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.600> a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
probably want to go ahead and make it a

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.750 
probably want to go ahead and make it a
little<00:04:28.230> bit<00:04:28.470> bigger<00:04:28.710> which<00:04:29.220> effectively

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
little bit bigger which effectively

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.990 
little bit bigger which effectively
makes<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.450> pretty<00:04:31.020> small<00:04:31.410> oops<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.550> did<00:04:32.850> not

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
makes that pretty small oops I did not

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.390 
makes that pretty small oops I did not
mean<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.240> do<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:34.040> want<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.100> go<00:04:35.160> ahead<00:04:35.250> and

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
mean to do that I want to go ahead and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.760 
mean to do that I want to go ahead and
how<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.330> do<00:04:36.420> this<00:04:36.540> how<00:04:37.080> do<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.260> grab<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.620> I

I<00:05:05.100> want<00:05:05.400> this<00:05:05.490> one<00:05:05.670> though<00:05:06.050> there<00:05:07.050> we<00:05:07.170> go<00:05:07.260> got

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
I want this one though there we go got

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.390 
I want this one though there we go got
it<00:05:07.650> figured<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.130> out

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
it figured it out

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.030 
it figured it out
nope<00:05:08.610> I'll<00:05:08.880> do<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.000> on<00:05:09.210> me<00:05:09.300> there<00:05:09.960> we<00:05:10.110> go<00:05:10.230> okay

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
nope I'll do that on me there we go okay

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.380 
nope I'll do that on me there we go okay
so<00:05:11.100> I<00:05:11.190> probably<00:05:11.400> ought<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.640> make<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:12.060> little

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
so I probably ought to make it a little

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.590 
so I probably ought to make it a little
bit<00:05:12.660> larger<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:14.460> let's<00:05:14.700> go<00:05:14.850> ahead<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.480> go

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
bit larger and let's go ahead it's go

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.850 
bit larger and let's go ahead it's go
ahead<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.810> stretch<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.200> video<00:05:16.470> preview

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
ahead and stretch that video preview

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.440 
ahead and stretch that video preview
back<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.250> full<00:05:17.460> size<00:05:17.670> so<00:05:17.880> we<00:05:17.970> can<00:05:18.000> see<00:05:18.270> what's

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
back to full size so we can see what's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.790 
back to full size so we can see what's
going<00:05:18.510> on<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.110> as<00:05:19.230> you<00:05:19.290> can<00:05:19.410> see<00:05:19.500> that

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
going on there and as you can see that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.070 
going on there and as you can see that
makes<00:05:20.070> my<00:05:20.370> webcam<00:05:20.760> footage<00:05:21.000> very<00:05:21.540> small<00:05:21.900> now

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
makes my webcam footage very small now

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.750 
makes my webcam footage very small now
in<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.320> center<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.620> my<00:05:22.710> screen<00:05:22.770> so<00:05:23.520> then<00:05:23.640> all<00:05:23.730> I

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
in the center of my screen so then all I

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.550 
in the center of my screen so then all I
do<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.270> put<00:05:24.630> it<00:05:24.750> in<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.960> right<00:05:25.110> corner<00:05:25.440> or<00:05:25.470> the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
do to put it in the right corner or the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.070 
do to put it in the right corner or the
left<00:05:25.770> corner<00:05:26.010> is<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.280> drag<00:05:26.880> this<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.780> line<00:05:28.050> it

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
left corner is I drag this and I line it

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.810 
left corner is I drag this and I line it
up<00:05:28.350> with<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.830> corner<00:05:29.160> there<00:05:29.490> so<00:05:29.670> that's

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
up with the corner there so that's

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.190 
up with the corner there so that's
effectively<00:05:29.940> gonna<00:05:30.420> put<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.870> bottom

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
effectively gonna put it in the bottom

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.020 
effectively gonna put it in the bottom
left<00:05:31.410> corner<00:05:31.500> which<00:05:31.860> really<00:05:32.190> in<00:05:32.820> my<00:05:32.970> opinion

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
left corner which really in my opinion

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.550 
left corner which really in my opinion
isn't<00:05:33.390> where<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.630> want<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.990> but<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:34.380> looks

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
isn't where you want it but that looks

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.410 
isn't where you want it but that looks
good<00:05:34.770> enough<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.010> me<00:05:35.280> for<00:05:35.490> now<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.060> we'll<00:05:36.270> leave

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
good enough to me for now so we'll leave

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.510 
good enough to me for now so we'll leave
it<00:05:36.480> down<00:05:36.750> there<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:37.350> we'll<00:05:38.010> close<00:05:38.190> this<00:05:38.370> out

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
it down there and we'll close this out

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160 
it down there and we'll close this out
and<00:05:38.790> that's<00:05:39.090> pretty<00:05:39.300> much<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:39.720> honestly

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
and that's pretty much it honestly

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.240 
and that's pretty much it honestly
because<00:05:40.320> now<00:05:40.470> you've<00:05:40.650> got<00:05:40.680> your<00:05:40.920> webcam

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
keep in mind that if you actually do

your webcam footage will be a lot longer

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.090 
your webcam footage will be a lot longer
than<00:05:48.510> your<00:05:48.780> gameplay<00:05:49.050> footage<00:05:49.290> and<00:05:49.590> what's

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
is gonna start recording and then before

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.770 
is gonna start recording and then before
the<00:05:54.900> gameplay<00:05:55.350> starts<00:05:55.800> filming<00:05:56.190> uh<00:05:56.780> you're

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
the gameplay starts filming uh you're

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.180 
the gameplay starts filming uh you're
gonna<00:05:57.870> have<00:05:57.960> some<00:05:58.290> space<00:05:58.620> where<00:05:58.650> it's<00:05:59.130> just

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
gonna have some space where it's just

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.650 
gonna have some space where it's just
like<00:05:59.280> you<00:05:59.460> talking<00:05:59.730> to<00:06:00.090> no<00:06:00.240> one<00:06:00.270> because

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
like you talking to no one because

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.240 
like you talking to no one because
there's<00:06:00.840> no<00:06:00.990> gameplay<00:06:01.500> there<00:06:01.770> so<00:06:02.160> you're

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
there's no gameplay there so you're

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.590 
there's no gameplay there so you're
gonna<00:06:02.310> have<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.610> line<00:06:02.850> it<00:06:02.880> up<00:06:03.120> with<00:06:03.330> when<00:06:03.480> you

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
gonna have to line it up with when you

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.690 
gonna have to line it up with when you
start<00:06:03.840> recording<00:06:03.990> so<00:06:04.920> let's<00:06:05.130> pretend<00:06:05.310> that<00:06:05.610> I

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
start recording so let's pretend that I

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.040 
start recording so let's pretend that I
started<00:06:06.090> recording<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.540> gameplay<00:06:06.810> footage

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
started recording the gameplay footage

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.630 
started recording the gameplay footage
right<00:06:07.260> here<00:06:07.650> you're<00:06:08.220> gonna<00:06:08.310> want<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.490> line

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
right here you're gonna want to line

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.170 
right here you're gonna want to line
that<00:06:08.820> up<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:10.220> then<00:06:11.220> start<00:06:11.520> recording<00:06:11.580> again

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
that up and then start recording again

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.800 
that up and then start recording again
so<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:12.840> it<00:06:12.980> syncs<00:06:13.980> your<00:06:14.090> mic<00:06:15.090> with<00:06:15.420> the<00:06:15.630> game

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
so that it syncs your mic with the game

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.140 
so that it syncs your mic with the game
here<00:06:16.130> and<00:06:17.130> that's<00:06:17.310> pretty<00:06:17.460> much<00:06:17.640> all<00:06:17.790> you<00:06:17.850> have

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
here and that's pretty much all you have

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.350 
here and that's pretty much all you have
to<00:06:18.270> do<00:06:18.390> at<00:06:18.540> that<00:06:18.570> point<00:06:18.750> um<00:06:19.940> then<00:06:20.940> you<00:06:21.060> can<00:06:21.210> just

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
to do at that point um then you can just

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.660 
to do at that point um then you can just
you<00:06:21.450> know<00:06:21.480> edit<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:21.990> video<00:06:22.230> with<00:06:22.440> any

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
you know edit the video with any

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.340 
you know edit the video with any
settings<00:06:23.670> you<00:06:23.820> want<00:06:24.000> to<00:06:24.120> do<00:06:24.270> make<00:06:24.660> it<00:06:24.840> HD

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
settings you want to do make it HD

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.910 
settings you want to do make it HD
whatever<00:06:26.340> click<00:06:26.970> okay<00:06:27.270> render<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:27.990> like<00:06:28.590> like

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
whatever click okay render it like like

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.080 
whatever click okay render it like like
so<00:06:29.160> I'm<00:06:29.340> not<00:06:29.430> really<00:06:29.550> gonna<00:06:29.700> go<00:06:29.880> into<00:06:30.060> that

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
so I'm not really gonna go into that

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.280 
so I'm not really gonna go into that
kind<00:06:30.390> of<00:06:30.420> stuff<00:06:30.600> because<00:06:30.690> you<00:06:30.900> guys<00:06:31.050> can

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
kind of stuff because you guys can

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.600 
kind of stuff because you guys can
figure<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.590> out<00:06:31.650> your<00:06:31.920> big<00:06:32.040> boys<00:06:32.250> and<00:06:32.370> girls

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
figure that out your big boys and girls

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.670 
figure that out your big boys and girls
but<00:06:33.510> I<00:06:33.540> guess<00:06:33.840> that's<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.110> end<00:06:34.200> of<00:06:34.350> the<00:06:34.440> video

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
but I guess that's the end of the video

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.290 
but I guess that's the end of the video
now<00:06:34.980> although<00:06:35.460> there<00:06:35.700> is<00:06:35.850> something<00:06:36.120> I<00:06:36.150> want

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
now although there is something I want

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.940 
now although there is something I want
to<00:06:36.360> talk<00:06:36.480> about<00:06:36.600> first<00:06:36.930> just<00:06:37.260> to<00:06:37.440> give<00:06:37.890> you

about<00:06:39.570> this

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
about this

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.620 
about this
to<00:06:40.110> make<00:06:40.259> it<00:06:40.380> a<00:06:40.410> little<00:06:40.500> easier<00:06:40.650> on<00:06:40.919> you<00:06:41.630> one

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
to make it a little easier on you one

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.540 
to make it a little easier on you one
thing<00:06:42.780> I<00:06:42.840> recommend<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.350> do<00:06:43.530> is<00:06:43.830> I<00:06:43.860> recommend

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
thing I recommend you do is I recommend

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.580 
thing I recommend you do is I recommend
that<00:06:44.729> when<00:06:45.000> you<00:06:45.300> are<00:06:45.600> recording<00:06:45.810> the<00:06:46.199> gameplay

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
that when you are recording the gameplay

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.320 
that when you are recording the gameplay
with<00:06:46.860> something<00:06:47.220> like<00:06:47.370> fraps<00:06:47.699> I'll<00:06:48.120> go<00:06:48.240> ahead

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
with something like fraps I'll go ahead

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.460 
with something like fraps I'll go ahead
and<00:06:48.509> show<00:06:48.630> you<00:06:48.690> this<00:06:48.900> really<00:06:49.080> quick<00:06:49.199> because

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
and show you this really quick because

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.620 
and show you this really quick because
it'll<00:06:49.860> make<00:06:49.919> it<00:06:50.009> easier<00:06:50.220> I<00:06:50.729> recommend<00:06:51.570> that

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
it'll make it easier I recommend that

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.930 
it'll make it easier I recommend that
you<00:06:51.690> don't<00:06:52.020> record<00:06:52.650> your<00:06:53.039> microphone<00:06:53.580> here

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
you don't record your microphone here

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.969 
you don't record your microphone here
with<00:06:54.360> fraps<00:06:54.690> because<00:06:55.139> then<00:06:55.380> your<00:06:55.590> webcam

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
with fraps because then your webcam

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.379 
with fraps because then your webcam
would<00:06:56.130> be<00:06:56.220> picking<00:06:56.430> up<00:06:56.580> your<00:06:56.610> microphone<00:06:57.150> at

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
would be picking up your microphone at

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.029 
would be picking up your microphone at
the<00:06:57.419> same<00:06:57.720> time<00:06:57.930> fraps<00:06:58.289> is<00:06:58.500> and<00:06:58.740> so<00:06:58.919> there

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 
the same time fraps is and so there

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.159 
the same time fraps is and so there
would<00:06:59.130> be<00:06:59.160> a<00:06:59.280> small<00:06:59.430> echo<00:06:59.820> effect<00:07:00.120> so<00:07:00.780> I

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
would be a small echo effect so I

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.890 
would be a small echo effect so I
recommend<00:07:01.770> that<00:07:01.889> you<00:07:02.009> only<00:07:02.190> record<00:07:02.639> the

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
recommend that you only record the

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.590 
recommend that you only record the
gameplay<00:07:03.900> audio<00:07:04.560> with<00:07:05.009> fraps<00:07:05.340> or<00:07:05.789> your<00:07:06.240> system

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
gameplay audio with fraps or your system

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.570 
gameplay audio with fraps or your system
audio<00:07:06.750> with<00:07:07.110> fraps<00:07:07.380> and<00:07:07.680> that<00:07:08.340> with<00:07:08.430> your

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
audio with fraps and that with your

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.340 
audio with fraps and that with your
webcam<00:07:08.759> you<00:07:09.210> only<00:07:09.479> record<00:07:09.810> your<00:07:09.960> mic<00:07:10.139> audio

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
webcam you only record your mic audio

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.290 
webcam you only record your mic audio
and<00:07:10.830> you<00:07:11.190> don't<00:07:11.400> record<00:07:11.669> your<00:07:11.789> system<00:07:12.030> audio

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
and you don't record your system audio

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.810 
and you don't record your system audio
because<00:07:12.570> that<00:07:12.750> will<00:07:12.930> prevent<00:07:13.400> the<00:07:14.400> sound<00:07:14.669> for

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
because that will prevent the sound for

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.159 
because that will prevent the sound for
being<00:07:15.000> recorded<00:07:15.270> with<00:07:15.449> two<00:07:15.599> programs<00:07:15.990> and

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169 
being recorded with two programs and

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.860 
being recorded with two programs and
having<00:07:16.289> a<00:07:16.440> small<00:07:16.650> echo<00:07:16.919> effect<00:07:17.690> other<00:07:18.690> than

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
having a small echo effect other than

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.060 
having a small echo effect other than
that<00:07:18.990> that's<00:07:19.050> pretty<00:07:19.139> much<00:07:19.320> it<00:07:19.530> guys<00:07:19.560> if<00:07:19.979> this
