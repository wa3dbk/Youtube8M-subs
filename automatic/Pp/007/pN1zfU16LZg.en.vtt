but there were some pills by his bed
which<00:01:00.840> makes<00:01:01.050> me<00:01:01.140> believe<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.949> type<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
don't know guys I don't know but I think

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.179 
don't know guys I don't know but I think
that<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.140> these<00:01:07.320> hints<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.740> adding<00:01:08.100> up

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that that all these hints are adding up

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
that that all these hints are adding up
to<00:01:08.340> something<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.820> hope<00:01:09.570> they're<00:01:09.750> adding<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to something I hope they're adding up to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
to something I hope they're adding up to
something<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.040> also<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
something and I also do think that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.719

kind of strange for a kid unless he's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630 
kind of strange for a kid unless he's
actually<00:01:31.290> having<00:01:31.799> hallucinations<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
actually having hallucinations so I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
actually having hallucinations so I

believe that this kid is actually like

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
believe that this kid is actually like
he<00:01:35.009> has<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.430> site<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> use<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.000> type<00:01:36.119> of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
he has some site to use some type of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.910 
he has some site to use some type of
disorder<00:01:36.570> guys<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.560> does

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
disorder guys and that he actually does

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.530 
disorder guys and that he actually does
become<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.340> marionette<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.060> end<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
become the marionette at the very end of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.060 
become the marionette at the very end of
five<00:01:39.869> nights<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.350> Freddy's<00:01:40.590> 4<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.860> only<00:01:40.950> see

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
five nights at Freddy's 4 I can only see

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
five nights at Freddy's 4 I can only see
him<00:01:41.159> crying<00:01:41.460> he<00:01:41.610> wears<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> same<00:01:41.970> type<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270

him crying he wears the same type of
clothes<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> believe<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.649> his<00:01:43.770> soul

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
clothes but I believe that his soul

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
clothes but I believe that his soul
became<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.180> puppet<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> marionette

and that he's trying to haunt back his
brother<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.180> maybe<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.659> people<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
brother and maybe some other people that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
brother and maybe some other people that
are<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.860> fragile<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.670> those<00:01:50.850> suits
