relieve myself of some excess stock of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
relieve myself of some excess stock of
emulsion<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.420> four<00:00:30.779> samples<00:00:31.289> for

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
emulsion that I have four samples for

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
emulsion that I have four samples for
testing<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.700> haven't<00:00:33.030> even<00:00:33.149> gotten<00:00:33.450> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
testing and I haven't even gotten to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
testing and I haven't even gotten to
test<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.380> emulsion<00:00:34.739> quite<00:00:35.190> yet<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

it's from a main brand manufacturer and
I<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> high-quality<00:00:40.430> emulsion<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
I know it's a high-quality emulsion and

I'm looking forward to working with it
in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> future<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> couple<00:00:45.149> types<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
in the future I have a couple types and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.950 
in the future I have a couple types and
they<00:00:46.410> are<00:00:46.530> photopolymer<00:00:47.340> emulsions

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
they are photopolymer emulsions

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.810 
they are photopolymer emulsions

McDiarmid<00:02:01.229> autotype<00:02:02.750> emulsions<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.929> have<00:02:04.050> two

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
McDiarmid autotype emulsions we have two

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
McDiarmid autotype emulsions we have two
types<00:02:04.470> here<00:02:04.739> they're<00:02:04.920> photo<00:02:05.220> polymers<00:02:05.789> but

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
types here they're photo polymers but

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119 
types here they're photo polymers but
there's<00:02:06.209> two<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.629> have<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.349> auto<00:02:07.560> soul<00:02:07.890> knife

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
there's two we have the auto soul knife

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.080 
there's two we have the auto soul knife
9000<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.099> auto<00:02:11.640> Saul

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
9000 and then we have the auto Saul

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.150 
9000 and then we have the auto Saul
Neptune<00:02:13.099> okay<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.830> giveaway<00:02:16.830> is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
Neptune okay so now this giveaway is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280 
Neptune okay so now this giveaway is
limited<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> continental<00:02:18.840> United<00:02:19.260> States

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
limited to the continental United States

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.710 
limited to the continental United States
because<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.160> emulsion<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.599> make

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
because it's emulsion so I have to make

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.229 
because it's emulsion so I have to make
it<00:02:21.930> easy<00:02:22.200> for<00:02:22.560> myself<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.099> ship<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
it easy for myself to ship it so that it

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.240 
it easy for myself to ship it so that it
doesn't<00:02:24.420> create<00:02:24.989> too<00:02:25.260> many<00:02:25.410> problems<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.129> me

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
doesn't create too many problems for me

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.449 
doesn't create too many problems for me
or<00:02:26.370> cost<00:02:26.640> me<00:02:26.879> too<00:02:27.060> much<00:02:27.090> okay<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.110> don't<00:02:29.040> fret

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
or cost me too much okay but don't fret

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.150 
or cost me too much okay but don't fret

autotype<00:03:10.320> emulsion<00:03:10.890> I've<00:03:11.040> had<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.610> a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
autotype emulsion I've had it for a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.430 
autotype emulsion I've had it for a
little<00:03:11.790> while<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.600> stuff's<00:03:12.870> good<00:03:13.110> for<00:03:13.350> about

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
little while this stuff's good for about

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.350 
little while this stuff's good for about
a<00:03:13.560> year<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> photopolymer<00:03:15.120> maybe

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
a year because it's a photopolymer maybe

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.180 
a year because it's a photopolymer maybe
even<00:03:15.600> more<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.830> stored

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
even more because if it's stored

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610 
even more because if it's stored
properly<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:18.570> can<00:03:18.720> last<00:03:18.930> quite<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> long<00:03:19.440> time

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
properly it can last quite a long time

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.210 
properly it can last quite a long time
so<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.550> want<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.120> give<00:03:21.240> these<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:23.100> know

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
so I want to give these out and you know

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.700 
so I want to give these out and you know
you'll<00:03:23.400> want<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.670> use<00:03:23.730> them<00:03:24.200> probably<00:03:25.200> you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
know before at the end of the year

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.880

free it's a whole gallon maybe you can
use<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:36.090> excess<00:03:36.600> emulsion<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.800> fine<00:03:38.370> tune

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
use the excess emulsion to fine tune

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.940 
use the excess emulsion to fine tune
your<00:03:38.670> screen<00:03:39.180> making<00:03:39.380> methods<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.620> get<00:03:40.770> your

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
your screen making methods and get your

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.710 
your screen making methods and get your
exposure<00:03:41.310> times<00:03:41.640> down<00:03:41.910> because<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.510> some

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
exposure times down because it's some

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.680 
exposure times down because it's some
free<00:03:43.020> extra<00:03:43.890> emulsion<00:03:44.400> alright<00:03:45.210> so<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.660> a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
free extra emulsion alright so it is a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.080
