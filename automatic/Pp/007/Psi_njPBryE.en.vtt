it's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.829> too<00:00:43.950> dark<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> left<00:00:44.670> side<00:00:44.910> if

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
it's a bit too dark on the left side if

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's a bit too dark on the left side if
we<00:00:45.750> open<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> aperture<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.160> looks<00:00:47.399> fine

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
we open up the aperture that looks fine

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
we open up the aperture that looks fine
but<00:00:47.730> now<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> too<00:00:48.660> bright<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.890> take

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
but now this is too bright I can take

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
but now this is too bright I can take
those<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.460> shots<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> throw<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.360> into

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
those two shots and throw them into

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.930 
those two shots and throw them into
Photoshop<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> nice<00:00:53.370> result<00:00:53.789> we're

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Photoshop and get this nice result we're

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
Photoshop and get this nice result we're
both<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> those<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.570> well<00:00:54.690> exposed<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.949> my

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
both of those are well exposed I want my

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.410 
both of those are well exposed I want my
camera<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.940> able<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
camera to be able to do that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
camera to be able to do that
automatically<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.559> after<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.920> take<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
automatically right after I take the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.819 
automatically right after I take the
shot<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> main<00:01:00.270> large<00:01:00.750> board<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
shot but the main large board here is a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.969 
shot but the main large board here is a
development<00:01:02.670> board<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.960> CPU<00:01:04.530> were<00:01:04.650> using

development board for the CPU were using
which<00:01:05.159> sometimes<00:01:05.400> you'd<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.299> able<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
which sometimes you'd like to be able to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
which sometimes you'd like to be able to
adjust<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> focus<00:01:07.409> after<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> take<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
adjust the focus after you take the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
adjust the focus after you take the
picture<00:01:09.180> rather<00:01:09.720> than<00:01:09.990> having<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.560> picture<00:01:10.979> in

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
picture rather than having a picture in

picture rather than having a picture in
which<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.700> which<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.299> thing<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.540> in

which in which just one thing is in

so<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> place<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> microlens<00:01:16.439> array<00:01:16.470> into

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so if you place a microlens array into

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.780 
so if you place a microlens array into
the<00:01:17.340> camera<00:01:17.610> we've<00:01:18.420> shown<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.380> can

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
the camera we've shown that you can

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
the camera we've shown that you can
refocus<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.060> change<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> focus<00:01:21.900> after<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
refocus it change the focus after you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
refocus it change the focus after you
take<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> picture<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:24.030> this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
take the picture do we have also this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.830 
photography the question is what do
people<00:01:37.619> work<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.040> next<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> last<00:01:39.450> ten

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
people work on next so for the last ten

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.569 
people work on next so for the last ten
years<00:01:39.869> there's<00:01:40.470> been<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> megapixel<00:01:41.009> war<00:01:41.430> as

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
years there's been a megapixel war as

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.520 
years there's been a megapixel war as
everyone<00:01:42.000> knows<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.810> finally<00:01:43.259> winding

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
everyone knows that's finally winding

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
everyone knows that's finally winding
down<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.340> Asian<00:01:44.670> camera<00:01:45.030> manufacturers<00:01:45.600> can

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
down the Asian camera manufacturers can

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.179 
down the Asian camera manufacturers can
no<00:01:45.840> longer<00:01:46.049> compete<00:01:46.470> based<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> number<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
no longer compete based on the number of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.710 
no longer compete based on the number of
megapixels<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.240> they're<00:01:48.390> beginning<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
megapixels so they're beginning to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
megapixels so they're beginning to
compete<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> feature<00:01:50.040> we'd<00:01:50.759> like

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
compete on one of the feature we'd like

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
compete on one of the feature we'd like
them<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.299> offer<00:01:51.990> lots<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.649> lots<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.950> features

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
them to offer lots and lots of features

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
them to offer lots and lots of features
that<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.700> research<00:01:53.970> community<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.540> currently

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that the research community is currently

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.359 
that the research community is currently
working<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> offer<00:01:55.770> those<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.219> at

we<00:02:04.240> would<00:02:04.420> like<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.600> make<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:05.649> programmable

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
we would like to make this programmable

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.719 
we would like to make this programmable
enough<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.810> student<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.129> course<00:02:09.369> or

another researcher at another university
