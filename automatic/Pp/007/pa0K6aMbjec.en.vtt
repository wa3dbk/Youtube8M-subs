00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
lot of pictures where this grenade at
the<00:02:18.780> very<00:02:18.930> bottom<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.130> very<00:02:20.340> center

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the very bottom is in the very center

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.450 
the very bottom is in the very center
and<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:21.780> some<00:02:21.930> reason<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.320> mine<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.560> can't<00:02:23.040> seem

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
and for some reason on mine I can't seem

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.760 
and for some reason on mine I can't seem
to<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.050> otherwise<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.320> strings<00:02:25.590> will

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
to get it otherwise the strings will

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.040 
to get it otherwise the strings will
look<00:02:25.920> loose<00:02:26.160> or<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:27.330> know<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> bottom

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
look loose or you know or the bottom

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.590 
look loose or you know or the bottom
grenade<00:02:28.320> will<00:02:28.470> fall<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.600> that's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
grenade will fall out so that's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.390 
grenade will fall out so that's
basically<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.410> best<00:02:31.590> position<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.070> could<00:02:32.220> get

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
basically the best position I could get

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.100 
basically the best position I could get
it<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:34.670> guess<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> trick<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.300> today<00:02:36.930> was

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it in I guess the trick here today was

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.750 
it in I guess the trick here today was
just<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.530> manage<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.950> cut<00:02:38.130> along<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
just kind of manage to cut along with it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.160 
just kind of manage to cut along with it
don't<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.210> afraid<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.510> pull<00:02:39.690> out<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.960> coat<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.110 
don't be afraid to pull out the coat a
little<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:41.370> long<00:02:41.460> as<00:02:41.670> you're<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:41.850> like

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
little bit as long as you're not like

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.090 
little bit as long as you're not like
tugging<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> really<00:02:43.080> hard<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.800> mean

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
tugging at it really hard it I mean

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.030 
tugging at it really hard it I mean
nothing<00:02:44.430> will<00:02:44.580> break<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:45.030> anything<00:02:45.210> but<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:46.040> was

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
nothing will break or anything but I was

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.560 
nothing will break or anything but I was
able<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.850> then<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> snuck<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
able to do that and then I snuck in a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.260 
able to do that and then I snuck in a
few<00:02:48.630> Joker<00:02:49.170> cards<00:02:49.530> into<00:02:50.070> his<00:02:50.370> gray<00:02:51.030> jacket

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
few Joker cards into his gray jacket

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:59.250 
few Joker cards into his gray jacket
there<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.050> can<00:02:52.200> see

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.339 

I<00:02:59.670> try<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.510> hot<00:03:02.140> toys

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
I try to get it like the hot toys

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.740 
I try to get it like the hot toys
pictures<00:03:02.860> when<00:03:03.819> they<00:03:03.909> first<00:03:04.120> released<00:03:04.510> them

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
pictures when they first released them

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.949 
pictures when they first released them
you<00:03:05.019> know<00:03:05.140> with<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.409> hand<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:06.099> high<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
you know with the hand really high and I

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.740 
you know with the hand really high and I
think<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.290> looks<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.620> lot<00:03:09.069> better<00:03:09.370> than<00:03:09.750> it

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
think this looks a lot better than it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.819 
think this looks a lot better than it
