pretty much the pinnacle of level design

you'll purchase items and level up and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.010 
you'll purchase items and level up and
where<00:02:02.939> you'll<00:02:03.060> teleport<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.600> different<00:02:03.840> areas

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020

but as i said earlier making your way
through<00:02:06.210> each<00:02:06.509> area<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> challenge<00:02:07.439> in

through each area is a challenge in

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.380 
through each area is a challenge in
itself<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:08.190> are<00:02:08.280> pretty<00:02:08.489> much<00:02:08.610> mazes<00:02:09.209> with

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
that are way too hard for you to kill

that are way too hard for you to kill
blood-borne<00:02:15.020> really<00:02:15.560> doesn't<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.010> hold

blood-borne really doesn't like to hold
your<00:02:16.280> hand<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.810> gives<00:02:17.930> afraid<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.260> cooties

your hand and it gives afraid of cooties
however<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.220> will<00:02:19.340> want<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.580> explore<00:02:19.880> every

however you will want to explore every
crevice<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.870> ensure<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.320> find<00:02:21.500> all<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
important for example blood vials are

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.070 
important for example blood vials are
used<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.940> restore<00:02:26.180> your<00:02:26.300> health<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.870> once

again<00:02:27.170> I'm<00:02:27.410> wondering<00:02:27.740> why<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.100> earth<00:02:28.280> you

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
again I'm wondering why on earth you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.830 
again I'm wondering why on earth you
would<00:02:28.700> want<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> jam<00:02:29.210> one<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.450> these<00:02:29.540> into<00:02:29.750> your

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
would want to jam one of these into your

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.570 
would want to jam one of these into your
leg<00:02:30.080> but<00:02:30.410> I'm<00:02:30.590> probably<00:02:31.010> thinking<00:02:31.490> too<00:02:31.550> much

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
leg but I'm probably thinking too much

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.920 
leg but I'm probably thinking too much
on<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.940> you'll<00:02:32.120> need<00:02:32.300> bullets<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.720> use<00:02:32.840> your

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
on it you'll need bullets to use your

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.330 
on it you'll need bullets to use your
gun<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.500> lot<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.710> other<00:02:33.860> items<00:02:34.190> can<00:02:34.310> be

gun and a lot of other items can be

more blood echoes a lot of these items
are<00:02:37.700> pretty<00:02:37.910> much<00:02:38.030> vital<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.480> your<00:02:38.570> success
