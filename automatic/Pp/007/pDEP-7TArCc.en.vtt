00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
of this thing seems like a little bit

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.490 
of this thing seems like a little bit
different<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.690> has<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.380> see

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
know kind of like the flimsy plastic I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.750 
know kind of like the flimsy plastic I
do<00:03:05.239> like<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.989> know<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.140> saw<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.610> pictures<00:03:07.610> out

do like you know I saw the pictures out
there<00:03:07.790> comparing<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.510> with<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.660> band-aid<00:03:09.049> and

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
there comparing it with a band-aid and

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.920 
there comparing it with a band-aid and
it<00:03:09.440> very<00:03:09.739> much<00:03:10.040> looks<00:03:10.310> like<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:11.660> kind<00:03:11.870> of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
it very much looks like that it kind of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.930 
it very much looks like that it kind of
feels<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.380> way<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.160> little<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:14.079> too<00:03:15.940> so

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
feels that way and a little bit too so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.640 
feels that way and a little bit too so
on<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.209> back<00:03:17.420> then<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.930> still<00:03:18.170> got<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.410> SIM

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
on the back then you still got the SIM

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.699 
on the back then you still got the SIM
card<00:03:18.920> slot<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:20.060> nothing<00:03:20.989> you'll<00:03:21.139> notice<00:03:21.500> very

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
card slot and nothing you'll notice very

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.599 
card slot and nothing you'll notice very
very<00:03:21.920> similar<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.230> Galaxy<00:03:24.430> active<00:03:25.430> that's

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
very similar to the Galaxy active that's

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.960 
very similar to the Galaxy active that's
for<00:03:25.790> active<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.389> isn't<00:03:26.720> waterproof<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:28.069> think

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
for active this isn't waterproof I think

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.500 
for active this isn't waterproof I think
it's<00:03:29.090> up<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.299> like<00:03:29.389> a<00:03:29.450> meter<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.359> that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
it's up to like a meter and with that

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.300 
it's up to like a meter and with that
being<00:03:32.660> said<00:03:32.780> at<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.260> bottom<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.920> got<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> have

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
being said at the bottom you got to have

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.710 
being said at the bottom you got to have
this<00:03:34.609> dilash<00:03:35.239> covered<00:03:35.780> up<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:38.510> know<00:03:38.660> to

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
this dilash covered up you know to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.539 
this dilash covered up you know to
enable<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.290> otherwise<00:03:39.680> you'll<00:03:40.220> ruin<00:03:40.459> your

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
enable that otherwise you'll ruin your

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.039 
enable that otherwise you'll ruin your
phone<00:03:40.819> but<00:03:40.940> if<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.389> latch<00:03:41.630> over<00:03:41.989> of

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
phone but if you have this latch over of

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.090 
phone but if you have this latch over of
course<00:03:42.079> I'm<00:03:42.319> you<00:03:42.470> know<00:03:42.590> I'm<00:03:42.680> going<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:42.889> test

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
course I'm you know I'm going to test

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.580 
course I'm you know I'm going to test
that<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.750> then<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:44.989> kind<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.230> cool<00:03:45.440> because

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
that and then it's kind of cool because

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.199 
that and then it's kind of cool because
at<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.889> top<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.340> don't<00:03:46.489> have<00:03:46.579> to<00:03:46.700> worry<00:03:46.910> about

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
at the top you don't have to worry about

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.740 
at the top you don't have to worry about
covering<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.750> either<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:49.239> there<00:03:50.239> we<00:03:50.389> go<00:03:50.600> with

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
covering that either so there we go with

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.349 
covering that either so there we go with
the<00:03:50.900> there's<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.380> form<00:03:51.620> box<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.430> what<00:03:53.239> we

the there's the form box and what we

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.539 
the there's the form box and what we

even get into anymore we're just gonna
go<00:03:55.849> ahead<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:57.200> compare<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:57.799> some<00:03:57.980> other

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
go ahead and compare it to some other

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.589 
go ahead and compare it to some other
devices<00:03:58.579> real<00:03:59.030> quick

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.449 
but you do see it's a little taller
overall<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.569> little<00:04:11.569> bit<00:04:11.690> taller<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.380> do<00:04:13.099> like

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
overall a little bit taller I do like

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.879 
overall a little bit taller I do like
the<00:04:13.639> sides<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.299> reminds<00:04:14.720> me<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> note<00:04:15.319> 3

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
the sides of it reminds me of the note 3

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.120 
the sides of it reminds me of the note 3
a<00:04:16.190> lot<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.720> back<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.229> no<00:04:18.380> question<00:04:18.829> which<00:04:18.950> one

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
a lot the back is no question which one

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.559 
a lot the back is no question which one
feels<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.489> lot<00:04:19.609> better<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:20.569 
feels a lot better the

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.010 
feels a lot better the
just<00:04:21.139> feels<00:04:21.620> much<00:04:21.859> better<00:04:22.099> on<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.370> s5<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
just feels much better on the s5 and

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.480 
just feels much better on the s5 and
that's<00:04:24.319> pretty<00:04:24.560> much<00:04:24.710> wraps<00:04:24.979> up<00:04:25.129> everything

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
that's pretty much wraps up everything

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.369 
that's pretty much wraps up everything
else<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.789> pretty<00:04:26.000> much<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.360> same<00:04:26.539> spots<00:04:27.020> as

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:27.379 
else is pretty much in the same spots as

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.050 
else is pretty much in the same spots as
far<00:04:27.439> as<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.009> volume<00:04:28.939> rocker<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:31.060> headphone

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
far as the volume rocker the headphone

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.040 
far as the volume rocker the headphone
jack<00:04:32.090> it's<00:04:32.479> kind<00:04:32.629> of<00:04:32.689> moved<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> other

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
jack it's kind of moved to the other

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.959 
jack it's kind of moved to the other
side<00:04:33.289> this<00:04:34.099> one<00:04:34.310> also<00:04:34.460> does<00:04:34.759> have<00:04:34.909> a

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
side this one also does have a

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.390 
side this one also does have a
fingerprint<00:04:35.449> reader<00:04:35.659> and<00:04:36.139> then<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:37.009> course

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
fingerprint reader and then of course

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.119 
fingerprint reader and then of course
the<00:04:37.520> bottom<00:04:37.819> has<00:04:37.969> to<00:04:38.000> cover<00:04:38.300> for<00:04:38.689> the<00:04:38.840> USB<00:04:39.740> part

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
the bottom has to cover for the USB part

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.770 
the bottom has to cover for the USB part
so<00:04:40.460> that's<00:04:40.610> comparing<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.569> s4<00:04:43.719> here<00:04:44.719> it

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
so that's comparing it to the s4 here it

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.860 
so that's comparing it to the s4 here it
is<00:04:44.870> against<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.259> Nexus<00:04:45.889> 5<00:04:46.479> which<00:04:47.479> is<00:04:47.539> very

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
is against the Nexus 5 which is very

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.529 
is against the Nexus 5 which is very
similar<00:04:48.460> in<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.520> lot<00:04:49.729> of<00:04:49.759> ways<00:04:50.000> just<00:04:50.330> do<00:04:50.419> the

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
similar in a lot of ways just do the

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.570 
similar in a lot of ways just do the
fact<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:51.020> has<00:04:51.110> two<00:04:51.259> 5-inch<00:04:52.060> display

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
fact that it has two 5-inch display

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.339 
fact that it has two 5-inch display
say<00:04:55.580> almost<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.180> very<00:04:56.479> very<00:04:56.659> similar<00:04:57.020> form

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
say almost a very very similar form

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.879 
say almost a very very similar form
factor<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:57.860> it's<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.069> little<00:04:58.370> bit<00:04:58.669> taller

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
factor and it's a little bit taller

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.430 
factor and it's a little bit taller
feels<00:05:00.889> about<00:05:01.129> the<00:05:01.280> same<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.729> hand<00:05:02.440> thickness

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
feels about the same in hand thickness

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.189 
feels about the same in hand thickness
is<00:05:03.590> right<00:05:03.800> about<00:05:04.009> the<00:05:04.190> same<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:05.930> kind<00:05:06.139> of

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
is right about the same so it kind of

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.540 
is right about the same so it kind of
really<00:05:06.379> comes<00:05:06.590> down<00:05:06.650> here<00:05:06.919> obviously<00:05:07.370> but<00:05:07.490> the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
really comes down here obviously but the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.879 
really comes down here obviously but the
Nexus<00:05:07.789> 5<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.240> have<00:05:08.389> stock<00:05:08.690> Android<00:05:09.259> or<00:05:09.500> Chino

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
Nexus 5 you have stock Android or Chino

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.589 
Nexus 5 you have stock Android or Chino
has<00:05:10.039> no<00:05:10.219> skins<00:05:10.550> running<00:05:10.789> over<00:05:10.940> top<00:05:11.150> of<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.419> and

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
has no skins running over top of it and

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.339 
has no skins running over top of it and
with<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:12.349> Samsung<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:12.919> do<00:05:13.009> have<00:05:13.159> TouchWiz

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
with the Samsung you do have TouchWiz

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.930 
with the Samsung you do have TouchWiz
another<00:05:15.349> thing<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.740> notice<00:05:16.069> about<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.550> Nexus

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
another thing to notice about the Nexus

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.700 
another thing to notice about the Nexus
5<00:05:17.210> that<00:05:17.539> it<00:05:17.719> doesn't<00:05:18.020> have<00:05:18.139> a<00:05:18.169> lot<00:05:18.409> of<00:05:18.439> it<00:05:18.680> you

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
5 that it doesn't have a lot of it you

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.290 
5 that it doesn't have a lot of it you
know<00:05:18.889> extra<00:05:19.310> features<00:05:19.669> in<00:05:19.819> there<00:05:20.000> that<00:05:20.210> you

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
know extra features in there that you

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.779 
know extra features in there that you
probably<00:05:20.900> find<00:05:21.080> on<00:05:21.289> the<00:05:21.349> Samsung<00:05:21.800> device<00:05:22.069> but

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
probably find on the Samsung device but

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.939 
probably find on the Samsung device but
then<00:05:23.270> again<00:05:23.389> you<00:05:23.599> may<00:05:23.719> not<00:05:23.870> use<00:05:24.110> them<00:05:24.259> and<00:05:24.529> I've

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
then again you may not use them and I've

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.890 
then again you may not use them and I've
typically<00:05:25.550> found<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:26.000> Nexus<00:05:26.300> devices<00:05:26.569> run

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
typically found that Nexus devices run

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.140 
typically found that Nexus devices run
so<00:05:27.080> much<00:05:27.289> faster

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
so much faster

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.640 
so much faster
you<00:05:29.150> know<00:05:29.270> then<00:05:29.449> Samsung<00:05:29.930> devices<00:05:30.229> or<00:05:30.500> any

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
you know then Samsung devices or any

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.469 
you know then Samsung devices or any
other<00:05:30.830> device<00:05:31.099> out<00:05:31.340> there<00:05:31.550> you<00:05:32.000> know<00:05:32.120> for<00:05:32.330> that

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
other device out there you know for that

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.820 
other device out there you know for that
matter<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.990> we're<00:05:33.379> gonna<00:05:33.469> see<00:05:33.710> if<00:05:33.800> that

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
matter and we're gonna see if that

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.430 
matter and we're gonna see if that
remains<00:05:34.250> true<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:34.699> that's<00:05:34.879> fine<00:05:35.289> another<00:05:36.289> one

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
remains true but that's fine another one

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.860 
remains true but that's fine another one
of<00:05:36.500> my<00:05:36.589> favorites<00:05:37.069> here<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.879> note<00:05:38.180> 3<00:05:38.599> as

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
of my favorites here the the note 3 as

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.339 
of my favorites here the the note 3 as
you<00:05:39.169> can<00:05:39.289> see<00:05:39.409> is<00:05:39.529> not<00:05:40.150> too<00:05:41.150> far<00:05:41.599> I<00:05:41.990> mean<00:05:42.169> of

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
you can see is not too far I mean of

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.619 
you can see is not too far I mean of
course<00:05:42.409> the<00:05:42.680> note<00:05:42.860> 3<00:05:43.099> is<00:05:43.129> gonna<00:05:43.370> be<00:05:43.520> bigger<00:05:43.819> but

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
course the note 3 is gonna be bigger but

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.240 
course the note 3 is gonna be bigger but
it's<00:05:44.810> not<00:05:45.050> drastic<00:05:46.360> and<00:05:47.360> it's<00:05:48.289> also<00:05:48.620> very

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
it's not drastic and it's also very

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.209 
it's not drastic and it's also very
similar<00:05:49.819> and<00:05:50.710> you<00:05:51.710> know<00:05:51.800> kind<00:05:52.009> of<00:05:52.099> how<00:05:52.159> the

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
similar and you know kind of how the

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.129 
similar and you know kind of how the
build<00:05:52.520> is<00:05:52.699> know<00:05:52.909> none<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.389> Fox<00:05:53.629> leather<00:05:53.990> on

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
build is know none of the Fox leather on

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.689 
build is know none of the Fox leather on
the<00:05:54.259> back<00:05:54.469> that<00:05:54.710> they<00:05:54.860> you<00:05:55.159> know<00:05:55.190> had<00:05:55.490> it<00:05:55.610> with

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
the back that they you know had it with

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.890 
the back that they you know had it with
the<00:05:55.759> note<00:05:55.909> 3<00:05:56.210> but<00:05:56.440> it's<00:05:57.440> definitely<00:05:58.900> similar

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
the note 3 but it's definitely similar

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.409 
the note 3 but it's definitely similar
in<00:06:00.020> a<00:06:00.080> lot<00:06:00.259> of<00:06:00.289> ways<00:06:00.529> but<00:06:00.949> you<00:06:01.250> know<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:02.000> note<00:06:02.150> 3

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
in a lot of ways but you know the note 3

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.820 
in a lot of ways but you know the note 3
is<00:06:02.449> definitely<00:06:02.900> wider<00:06:03.080> it's<00:06:03.469> definitely

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
is definitely wider it's definitely

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.070 
is definitely wider it's definitely
taller<00:06:04.039> and<00:06:04.460> you<00:06:04.699> know<00:06:04.879> a<00:06:05.210> little<00:06:05.839> bit<00:06:05.930> more

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
taller and you know a little bit more

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.600 
taller and you know a little bit more
awkward<00:06:06.259> to<00:06:06.589> use<00:06:06.770> depending<00:06:07.219> on<00:06:07.370> who<00:06:07.490> you<00:06:07.580> are

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
awkward to use depending on who you are

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.209 
awkward to use depending on who you are
but<00:06:08.509> that's<00:06:09.199> the<00:06:09.289> comparison<00:06:09.620> between<00:06:09.889> both

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219 
but that's the comparison between both

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.610 
but that's the comparison between both
clothes<00:06:10.690> of<00:06:11.690> course<00:06:11.750> I<00:06:11.990> had<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.199> compare<00:06:12.529> it

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
clothes of course I had to compare it

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.200 
clothes of course I had to compare it
against<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.979> monster<00:06:13.460> phablet<00:06:13.849> which<00:06:14.000> is<00:06:14.120> the

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
against a monster phablet which is the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.930 
against a monster phablet which is the
Nokia<00:06:14.419> Lumia<00:06:14.659> 1520<00:06:15.469> it's<00:06:15.949> a<00:06:16.069> 6-inch<00:06:16.729> display

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
Nokia Lumia 1520 it's a 6-inch display

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.469 
Nokia Lumia 1520 it's a 6-inch display
compared<00:06:17.599> to<00:06:17.690> a<00:06:17.750> 5.1<00:06:18.349> on<00:06:18.589> this<00:06:18.770> side<00:06:19.060> of<00:06:20.060> course

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
compared to a 5.1 on this side of course

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.839 
compared to a 5.1 on this side of course
it's<00:06:20.690> gonna<00:06:20.779> be<00:06:20.870> thinner<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:22.550> know<00:06:22.669> it's

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
it's gonna be thinner you know it's

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.129 
it's gonna be thinner you know it's
gonna<00:06:22.940> be<00:06:23.120> shorter<00:06:23.539> and<00:06:23.659> all<00:06:23.750> that<00:06:23.930> good<00:06:24.080> stuff

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
gonna be shorter and all that good stuff

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.350 
gonna be shorter and all that good stuff
but<00:06:24.409> it<00:06:24.620> still<00:06:24.800> gives<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.099> a<00:06:25.129> good<00:06:25.250> idea<00:06:25.360> and

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
but it still gives you a good idea and

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.850 
but it still gives you a good idea and
if<00:06:26.449> you're<00:06:26.599> going<00:06:26.810> from<00:06:27.020> one<00:06:27.259> to<00:06:27.409> the<00:06:27.440> other<00:06:27.560> or

considering either one of these devices

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:31.010 
considering either one of these devices
what

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
what

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.610 
what
kind<00:06:31.169> of<00:06:31.259> size<00:06:31.470> difference<00:06:31.740> you're<00:06:32.069> gonna<00:06:32.160> see

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
kind of size difference you're gonna see

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.460 
kind of size difference you're gonna see
going<00:06:34.620> down<00:06:34.740> we<00:06:35.039> got<00:06:35.160> it<00:06:35.250> against<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:36.080> HTC<00:06:37.080> One

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
going down we got it against the HTC One

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.980 
going down we got it against the HTC One
m8<00:06:38.190> this<00:06:38.400> is<00:06:38.460> the<00:06:38.610> latest<00:06:38.910> one<00:06:39.090> which<00:06:39.840> is

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
m8 this is the latest one which is

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.920 
m8 this is the latest one which is
probably<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.710> two<00:06:40.949> top<00:06:41.220> Android<00:06:41.669> phones<00:06:41.970> this

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
probably the two top Android phones this

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.909 
probably the two top Android phones this
year<00:06:43.289> so<00:06:44.250> far<00:06:44.580> so<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:44.909> say<00:06:45.150> and<00:06:45.650> they're<00:06:46.650> very

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
year so far so to say and they're very

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.219 
year so far so to say and they're very
similar<00:06:47.310> I<00:06:47.520> mean<00:06:47.550> they're<00:06:47.849> a<00:06:47.879> little<00:06:48.419> bit<00:06:48.690> it's

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
similar I mean they're a little bit it's

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.899 
similar I mean they're a little bit it's
a<00:06:49.319> little<00:06:49.560> bit<00:06:49.650> taller<00:06:49.889> on<00:06:50.129> the<00:06:50.250> m8<00:06:50.550> that's

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
a little bit taller on the m8 that's

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.850 
a little bit taller on the m8 that's
mainly<00:06:51.419> due<00:06:51.569> to<00:06:51.599> the<00:06:51.840> speaker<00:06:52.259> grilles<00:06:52.500> at<00:06:52.770> the

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
mainly due to the speaker grilles at the

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.159 
mainly due to the speaker grilles at the
top<00:06:53.039> and<00:06:53.220> bottom<00:06:53.310> with<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.639> boom<00:06:53.819> sound<00:06:54.169> very

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
top and bottom with the boom sound very

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.670 
top and bottom with the boom sound very
similar<00:06:55.440> specs<00:06:55.830> with<00:06:56.069> both<00:06:56.250> of<00:06:56.400> these<00:06:56.460> devices

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
similar specs with both of these devices

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.110 
similar specs with both of these devices
they<00:06:58.680> kind<00:06:58.919> of<00:06:58.979> feel<00:06:59.159> the<00:06:59.310> same<00:06:59.520> of<00:06:59.729> course<00:06:59.940> the

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
they kind of feel the same of course the

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.700 
they kind of feel the same of course the
HTC<00:07:00.659> one's<00:07:00.870> gonna<00:07:00.990> have<00:07:01.139> that<00:07:01.289> in<00:07:01.500> a<00:07:01.590> better

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
HTC one's gonna have that in a better

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.680 
HTC one's gonna have that in a better
build<00:07:02.039> quality<00:07:02.129> but<00:07:02.699> the<00:07:02.819> aluminum<00:07:03.210> if<00:07:03.539> you

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
build quality but the aluminum if you

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.320 
build quality but the aluminum if you
prefer<00:07:04.470> that<00:07:04.770> but<00:07:05.550> that's<00:07:05.789> what<00:07:05.940> they<00:07:06.090> look

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
prefer that but that's what they look

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.270 
prefer that but that's what they look
like<00:07:06.360> a<00:07:06.780> head-to-head<00:07:07.110> five<00:07:07.560> minutes<00:07:07.889> display

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
like a head-to-head five minutes display

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.469 
like a head-to-head five minutes display
here<00:07:08.729> and<00:07:08.909> you<00:07:09.449> have<00:07:09.630> the<00:07:09.840> 5.1<00:07:10.380> on<00:07:10.650> the<00:07:10.740> side

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
here and you have the 5.1 on the side

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.520 
here and you have the 5.1 on the side
and<00:07:12.479> last<00:07:12.690> but<00:07:12.840> not<00:07:12.900> least<00:07:13.110> we're<00:07:13.199> gonna<00:07:13.289> doing

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
and last but not least we're gonna doing

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.339 
and last but not least we're gonna doing
this<00:07:13.620> to<00:07:13.740> iPhone<00:07:14.130> 5s<00:07:14.729> so<00:07:15.259> obviously<00:07:16.259> the

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:16.349 
this to iPhone 5s so obviously the

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.110 
this to iPhone 5s so obviously the
iPhone<00:07:16.680> came<00:07:16.860> out<00:07:16.949> last<00:07:17.159> September<00:07:17.310> it's

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
iPhone came out last September it's

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.580 
iPhone came out last September it's
gonna<00:07:18.240> be<00:07:18.419> much<00:07:18.569> smaller<00:07:18.930> it's<00:07:19.169> a<00:07:19.229> 4-inch

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
gonna be much smaller it's a 4-inch

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.330 
gonna be much smaller it's a 4-inch
display<00:07:19.740> versus<00:07:20.520> a<00:07:20.550> 5.1<00:07:21.120> in<00:07:21.780> every<00:07:22.620> respect<00:07:22.889> it

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 
display versus a 5.1 in every respect it

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.029 
display versus a 5.1 in every respect it
is<00:07:23.819> a<00:07:23.880> much<00:07:24.210> smaller<00:07:24.539> device<00:07:24.870> so<00:07:25.349> if<00:07:25.710> you're

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 
is a much smaller device so if you're

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.709 
is a much smaller device so if you're
really<00:07:26.219> in<00:07:26.400> the<00:07:26.550> smaller<00:07:27.030> devices<00:07:27.539> you'll

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
really in the smaller devices you'll

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.990 
really in the smaller devices you'll
you'll<00:07:27.960> love<00:07:28.199> the<00:07:28.380> iPhone<00:07:28.830> if<00:07:29.729> you<00:07:29.789> want<00:07:29.969> a

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
you'll love the iPhone if you want a

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.209 
you'll love the iPhone if you want a
bigger<00:07:30.180> screen<00:07:30.479> on<00:07:31.169> iPhones<00:07:31.680> definitely

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:32.219 
bigger screen on iPhones definitely

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.670 
bigger screen on iPhones definitely
starting<00:07:32.550> to<00:07:32.580> lack<00:07:32.789> at<00:07:32.969> that<00:07:33.090> point<00:07:33.360> so<00:07:33.680> that's

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
starting to lack at that point so that's

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.379 
starting to lack at that point so that's
gonna<00:07:34.949> pretty<00:07:35.130> much<00:07:35.340> wrap<00:07:35.580> it<00:07:35.759> up<00:07:35.909> folks
