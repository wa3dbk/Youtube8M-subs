00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.820
 new topic of violence in the music business the 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.380
 The cappuccinos already have it on the wall 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.470
 experienced own body 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.680
 they were beaten because they beat 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.320
 to sing 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.740
 But you are not the first victims of 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.610
 to attack such cowards 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 so they were at an appearance 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.520
 Called now there is something on the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.940
 snout 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.790
 he hits high 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.770
 Two men left for an appearance 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 this band started on the singer 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.720
 This happened after an occurrence 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 the travemÃ¼nder week 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.040
 the two men and schlager hotter 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.520
 first hit the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.820
 band members as the frontman 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.670
 Michel intervened, it caught him 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 man beat and kicked him until 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.280
 he lay on the ground 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.579
 a nose fracture bruises and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 bruises were the result of such 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.410
 But events are not uncommon in the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.759
 schlager in 2010 became the singer 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.270
 ruddy known by his hit off in the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.929
 attacked south 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.670
 he too was beaten so hard 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.590
 so he bruises and some 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 suffered from bruises 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.560
 also ibrahim tatlises a well-known 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.590
 Turkish hit star was scared to death 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.159
 an unknown shot this time even out 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.579
 a car on the artist 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.770
 a bullet hit his head and he was lying 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.350
 thus in the coma 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.360
 But there are also artists 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.880
 themselves with each other such cases 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.120
 For example, there is the singer Frank 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 lars actually frank harald stelzer and 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.040
 former boxer of his colleagues 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.100
 visited and then brutally collapses 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.380
 when I spoke to the network at that time 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.789
 he became very angry and wanted me 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.719
 Sue 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.829
 he had tried it but the 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:17.310
 Prosecutor's Office saw it differently and 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.379
 smashed his ad off one 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.170
 decisive role played thereby 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.870
 certainly the fact that I am the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.359
 Police give me six present statements 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.250
 could submit 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.980
 among them were two 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.889
 people he hits with targeted 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.340
 brutally beaten to the ground 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:41.129
 Furthermore, there were threats 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.859
 also addressed to me 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.440
 he did not have them and even before women 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.020
 shut up 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.510
 his coworker made Michael 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.620
 then a post on his 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.410
 web page on with the following quote it is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.470
 again at the time another 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.620
 Asshole of the month to insert her 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.600
 the winner this month is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.090
 oliver stones 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.460
 The man calls himself an artist and sets 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.240
 to regulate all in the 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.300
 society is normal the way 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.120
 I usually pay attention to people 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.110
 your career but if someone works 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.850
 not only selfish but already 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.630
 self-centered is me too 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.510
 Hutschnur True to the motto if I am 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.390
 I can not convince 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.420
 At least he causes confusion 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.060
 his poor life and tries himself 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.480
 at the expense of others the necessary lobby too 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.459
 provide 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.239
 artistically and purely musically 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.550
 he does not get much in the row 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.550
 actually a pity because there were times 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.980
 where a certain potential is latent 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.870
 was present 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.519
 this potential then had to be due 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.120
 any bad 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.090
 Characteristics soft 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.330
 He also has a forum and leads it like 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.159
 it belongs to a king 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.409
 whoever does not agree with him will 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.850
 deleted because there are no two 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.950
 opinions 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.190
 striking, however, is the oliver 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.200
 Stone always manages to get through it 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.700
 negative headlines in the foreground 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.340
 deliver 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.930
 the have assholes blut 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 internalized and there he is master in it 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.340
 congratulations oliver stein and 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.670
 also you have good chances to asshole 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.100

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.390
 all the best in your little world and 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.050
 a good flight to other spheres 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.710
 quote end back to frank lamers 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.770
 There was an incident in the way 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.640
 the singer joel good together with 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.920
 the singer Peter Sebastian worked in 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.230
 a hotel came to the incident 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.960
 between the two 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.620
 Peter requested 6 from the singer joel 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.520
 He felt pressured and ran away 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.670
 when Frank Lars heard about it he wrote 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.770
 publicly that peter from him what on 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.260
 get maul 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.140
 Peter is and remains an ice cold one 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.220
 typ and invited frank to a radio show 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.190
 1 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.790
 they turned it into a show and 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:35.540
 Peter vehemently denied this matter 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.930
 frank very small believed him and everything 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.930
 was good
