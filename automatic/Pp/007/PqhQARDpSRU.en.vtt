00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 every day it's the same ritual this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.960
 apprentice puts on his new outfit 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.500
 pastry 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.420
 let's go to the workshops 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.549
 production since the month of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.410
 September mathilde bachand work three 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.210
 four weeks in apprenticeship 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 in this reputed catering company 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 then the recipe here we are going to have three 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.490
 liters of milk is then for the sequel 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.130
 we will have 7,150 g of the equivalent in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.340
 sugar is a little bit of flank powder 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 what is a pastry cream? 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 but at age 24 mathilde does not always have 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 been a professional budding of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.230
 desserts his course is rather 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 atypical 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.469
 i did five years at sciences in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.690
 paris first I specialized in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.280
 European affairs 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 then after graduation I became 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.350
 press officer for the media 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.070
 and then after a year and a 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.260
 it is to return an intellectual who 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.629
 finally prefers manual work and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.519
 who realizes a teenager dream in 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.500
 through the training center of 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.960
 apprentices in this society 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 this type of reconversion is becoming 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.360
 more common every year we have people 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.399
 very who come to make a trade of 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.750
 mouth actually this is the boss that we 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.820
 does a lot of literary studies or 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.909
 scientists and I think for matt 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.770
 hill is a passion because by a 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.850
 fashion phenomenon fist I spent 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.040
 many day strokes in front of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.480
 the computer in my previous 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.780
 finally 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.400
 and it's true it's nice enough 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.170
 to use her hands at the exit she 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.940
 should find a job more 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 easily but for the young woman 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.540
 the essential is the fulfillment that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.210
 it matters to him this new work 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.500
 the feeling of doing something that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.530
 make sense not something 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.810
 manuals artistic 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.050
 that was what I did not want 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.120
 globally for the future alone here 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.280
 the final exam being but capc am 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.050
 necessary in pastry but mathilde 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.970
 hope to continue learning again 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.800
 some time to perfect and 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.600
 open why not in a few years 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.600
 his own tea room
