00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.580
 Y 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.710
 hello welcome angelines if you want 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.100
 know how to make this Christmas design 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.740
 keep looking 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.190
 you will need a green glaze other 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.529
 gold and silver a top coat with effect 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.040
 special shine a sponge 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.910
 makeup scissors and a piece of cardboard 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.910
 or something similar 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.660
 we start by applying a green enamel and 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.860
 that the design is inspired by the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 decoration of a Christmas tree 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.770
 in my case I will give two layers since the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.830
 first does not cover very well 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 As you can see there is a metallic green but 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.820
 serves any other 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.979
 We will do the finances with a 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.680
 Makeup sponge what will give them 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.360
 spongy and irregular appearance for 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.430
 we will need that the edge that 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.729
 let's use be sharp and not 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.920
 rounded in addition the whole sponge 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.420
 it would be very big and difficult to manage is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.369
 why I cut a piece 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.310
 small making sure the edges 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.530
 they are making a corner we put some 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 gold enamel drops of silver on 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.119
 a cardboard or something similar for example 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.119
 worth the cover of a cookie box 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.439
 we wet the corner of the sponge in the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.020
 enamel and we throw the excess hitting 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.090
 softly on the cardboard and the same 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.130
 we draw a line on the nail 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.159
 giving little taps of form 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.680
 diagonal I'm going to make two of the girls 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.840
 in gold and one in silver though 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.399
 you can make them all the same color or 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.399
 alternate those of different form 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.379
 as I told you I'm going to repeat the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.599
 operation with the silver obviously if 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.519
 your nails are smaller you can do 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.519
 the same design but with less lines 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.340
 we apply the top coat with effect 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.120
 special because the brightness mimics the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 tree balls 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.690
 and our Christmas nails are ready 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.690
 until next and happy Christmas
