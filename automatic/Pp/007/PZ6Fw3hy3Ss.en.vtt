hey there Ryan with you again for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.220 
hey there Ryan with you again for
another<00:00:13.790> video<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.300> today<00:00:14.389> we're<00:00:14.990> going<00:00:15.080> to

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
another video and today we're going to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.660 
another video and today we're going to
talk<00:00:15.380> about<00:00:15.500> something<00:00:15.770> a<00:00:15.980> little<00:00:16.340> out<00:00:16.430> of<00:00:16.460> the

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
talk about something a little out of the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.030 
talk about something a little out of the
ordinary<00:00:16.700> something<00:00:17.480> called<00:00:17.689> bokeh<00:00:18.349> but

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
ordinary something called bokeh but

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.470 
ordinary something called bokeh but
before<00:00:19.340> we<00:00:19.460> get<00:00:19.580> too<00:00:19.790> into<00:00:20.060> it<00:00:20.210> let<00:00:20.360> me<00:00:20.390> show

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
before we get too into it let me show

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.179 
before we get too into it let me show
you<00:00:20.660> an<00:00:20.810> example<00:00:20.900> do<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:21.890> see<00:00:22.010> all<00:00:22.099> those

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
you an example do you see all those

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.140 
you an example do you see all those
little<00:00:22.369> fuzzy<00:00:22.700> dots<00:00:22.880> in<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.119> background

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
little fuzzy dots in the background

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.589 
little fuzzy dots in the background
that's<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.230> good<00:00:24.380> representation<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:25.189> bokeh<00:00:25.759> so

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's a good representation of bokeh so

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.749 
that's a good representation of bokeh so
what<00:00:26.779> is<00:00:26.930> bokeh<00:00:27.380> exactly<00:00:27.980> well<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
what is bokeh exactly well it's the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.519 
what is bokeh exactly well it's the
blurry<00:00:29.000> or<00:00:29.270> fuzzy<00:00:29.570> parts<00:00:29.960> of<00:00:30.050> an<00:00:30.140> image<00:00:30.349> or

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
blurry or fuzzy parts of an image or

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
more specifically the aesthetic quality

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.350 
more specifically the aesthetic quality
of<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:33.380> fuzziness<00:00:33.940> bokeh<00:00:34.940> can<00:00:35.090> manifest

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
of that fuzziness bokeh can manifest

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.150 
of that fuzziness bokeh can manifest
itself<00:00:35.630> in<00:00:36.020> many<00:00:36.230> different<00:00:36.380> ways<00:00:36.680> being

itself in many different ways being
either<00:00:37.309> good<00:00:37.640> or<00:00:37.670> bad<00:00:37.850> soft<00:00:38.720> or<00:00:38.989> hard

example<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:43.040> just<00:00:43.070> showed<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:43.400> the<00:00:43.730> bokeh<00:00:44.030> was

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
example we just showed you the bokeh was

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.790 
example we just showed you the bokeh was
most<00:00:44.510> apparent<00:00:44.780> because<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.290> subject<00:00:45.680> was

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
most apparent because the subject was

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.830 
most apparent because the subject was
photographed<00:00:46.250> in<00:00:46.430> front<00:00:46.490> of<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.970> strong<00:00:47.300> point

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
photographed in front of a strong point

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.300 
photographed in front of a strong point
light<00:00:48.080> source<00:00:48.380> which<00:00:48.680> was<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.890> string<00:00:49.190> of

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
light source which was a string of

light source which was a string of
lights<00:00:49.490> on<00:00:49.700> a<00:00:49.760> tree<00:00:50.060> so<00:00:50.990> how<00:00:51.110> do<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:51.290> make<00:00:51.440> your

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
lights on a tree so how do you make your

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.350 
lights on a tree so how do you make your
camera<00:00:52.070> produce<00:00:52.400> bokeh<00:00:52.760> well

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
camera produce bokeh well

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.150 
camera produce bokeh well
bokeh<00:00:53.900> comes<00:00:54.110> out<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.380> play<00:00:54.410> when<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.980> depth

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
bokeh comes out to play when the depth

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.070 
bokeh comes out to play when the depth
of<00:00:55.310> field<00:00:55.520> is<00:00:55.670> quite<00:00:55.850> limited<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.870> first

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
of field is quite limited and the first

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.540 
of field is quite limited and the first
thing<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.320> need<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.650> camera<00:00:57.920> where<00:00:58.310> you<00:00:58.400> can

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
thing you need is a camera where you can

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.430 
thing you need is a camera where you can
manually<00:00:58.880> set<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.210> aperture<00:00:59.720> and<00:00:59.870> you'll

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
manually set the aperture and you'll

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.990 
manually set the aperture and you'll
want<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.680> set<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.100> large<00:01:01.370> aperture<00:01:01.670> like

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
want to set it to a large aperture like

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.800 
want to set it to a large aperture like

like F 1.8 the more limited the depth of
field<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.020> greater<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.439> effect<00:01:09.579> once

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
you get into smaller apertures though
