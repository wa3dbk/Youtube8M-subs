an<00:00:55.289> ice<00:00:55.469> cream<00:00:55.800> cone<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:57.149> broke<00:00:58.079> off<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
an ice cream cone I just broke off the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
an ice cream cone I just broke off the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sides of the ice cream cone so it would

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.110 
sides of the ice cream cone so it would
fit<00:01:00.989> nicely<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> side<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> cake<00:01:02.850> so
