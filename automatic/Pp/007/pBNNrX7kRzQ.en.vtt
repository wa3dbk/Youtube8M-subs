okay<00:00:00.359> all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.870> today<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.380> are<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.530> to

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
okay all right today we are going to

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.830 
okay all right today we are going to
evaluate<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.310> previous<00:00:02.790> gravity<00:00:03.449> MF

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
evaluate the previous gravity MF

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.460 
evaluate the previous gravity MF
multi-fuel<00:00:05.330> system<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.540> see<00:00:06.720> how<00:00:06.899> easy<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.350> is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
multi-fuel system and see how easy it is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.299 
multi-fuel system and see how easy it is
to<00:00:07.740> operate<00:00:07.890> I'm<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.240> be<00:00:09.389> pumping<00:00:09.840> here

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
to operate I'm going to be pumping here

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.930 
to operate I'm going to be pumping here
about<00:00:11.309> 15<00:00:11.820> times<00:00:14.089> 10<00:00:15.089> 11<00:00:15.780> 12<00:00:16.109> 13<00:00:16.320> 14<00:00:16.680> 15

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
about 15 times 10 11 12 13 14 15

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.230 
about 15 times 10 11 12 13 14 15
okay<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.810> I'm<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.439> let<00:00:19.590> some<00:00:20.220> gas<00:00:20.490> into

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
okay now I'm going to let some gas into

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
okay now I'm going to let some gas into
the<00:00:22.609> chamber<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:25.740> prime<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:27.740> which<00:00:28.740> I'm

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the chamber here to prime it which I'm

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
the chamber here to prime it which I'm
not<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.910> close<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
not going to close it now I'm going to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.350 
not going to close it now I'm going to
let<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.420> fuel<00:00:33.420> burn<00:00:34.280> until<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.230> stove<00:00:37.530> gets

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
let the fuel burn until the stove gets

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
let the fuel burn until the stove gets
primed<00:00:39.379> heating<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:42.020> element<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
primed heating the element here that you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.710 
primed heating the element here that you
see

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.530 

as<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:48.500> see<00:00:48.740> we<00:00:48.920> tried<00:00:49.550> even<00:00:49.790> some<00:00:50.240> windy

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
as you can see we tried even some windy

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.860 
as you can see we tried even some windy
conditions<00:00:51.520> which<00:00:52.520> going<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.880> be<00:00:53.330> interesting

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
conditions which going to be interesting

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.860 
conditions which going to be interesting
to<00:00:53.900> see<00:00:54.310> how<00:00:55.310> it<00:00:55.520> works<00:00:58.240> we<00:00:59.240> are<00:00:59.270> going<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.720> be

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
to see how it works we are going to be

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.310 
to see how it works we are going to be
waiting<00:01:00.200> for<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> flame<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.800> get<00:01:01.870> low

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:16.840 

indicating

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.770 

indicating<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:20.360> system<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.510> ready

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
indicating then that the system is ready

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.110 
indicating then that the system is ready
to<00:01:22.970> get<00:01:23.970> more<00:01:24.750> fuel<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.260> is<00:01:25.440> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> be

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
to get more fuel that is going to be

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.700 
to get more fuel that is going to be
transferred<00:01:27.120> into<00:01:27.300> gas<00:01:27.660> as<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.590> be

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
transferred into gas as I'm going to be

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.970 
transferred into gas as I'm going to be
switching<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.850> again

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.670 

as<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.790> see<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.180> frame<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.870> going<00:01:41.170> lower<00:01:41.410> and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
as you see the frame is going lower and

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.480 
as you see the frame is going lower and
now<00:01:41.920> I'm<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.520> let<00:01:42.820> more<00:01:43.090> gas<00:01:43.300> in

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.679 

okay<00:01:50.229> claim<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.380> going<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.770> get<00:01:52.420> smaller<00:01:53.420> and

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
okay claim is going to get smaller and

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.080 
okay claim is going to get smaller and
smaller<00:01:54.159> going<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.250> get<00:01:55.430> another<00:01:55.759> five<00:01:56.180> pumps

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
smaller going to get another five pumps

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.870 
smaller going to get another five pumps
here<00:01:59.090> we<00:01:59.210> go

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
here we go

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.290 
here we go
the<00:02:01.150> stove<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.570> ready<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.020> use<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.890> blue

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
the stove is ready to use the blue

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the stove is ready to use the blue
orange<00:02:04.300> frame<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.750> gone<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.870> stove<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
orange frame is gone and the stove is

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.650 
orange frame is gone and the stove is
ready<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.920> used<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.729> system<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.270> all

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
ready to be used and the system is all
