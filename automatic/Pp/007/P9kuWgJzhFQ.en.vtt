00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the alien ESCA type cases I guess you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.539 
the alien ESCA type cases I guess you
would<00:02:23.680> say<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.440> moving<00:02:26.709> around<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.280> side

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
would say but moving around to the side

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.530 
would say but moving around to the side
as<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:29.260> said<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.099> side<00:02:30.400> panel<00:02:31.000> has<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
as we said the one side panel has a

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.600 
as we said the one side panel has a
vented<00:02:31.989> area<00:02:32.379> for<00:02:32.590> what<00:02:32.739> appears<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.280> two

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
vented area for what appears to be two

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.550 
vented area for what appears to be two
hundred<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.090> twenty<00:02:34.390> millimeter<00:02:34.810> fans<00:02:35.170> I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
hundred and twenty millimeter fans I

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.589 
hundred and twenty millimeter fans I
would<00:02:36.280> say<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.730> course<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.180> has<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.330> two

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
would say and of course it has a two

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.720 
would say and of course it has a two
thumb<00:02:37.870> screws<00:02:37.900> at<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.349> back<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.579> go

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
thumb screws at the back so we can go

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.460 
thumb screws at the back so we can go
ahead<00:02:40.000> take<00:02:40.209> those<00:02:40.480> off<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.720> pop<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.319> out<00:02:41.410> and

ahead take those off and pop it out and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.250 
ahead take those off and pop it out and
get<00:02:41.680> all<00:02:41.829> our<00:02:42.040> stuff<00:02:42.069> in<00:02:42.549> there<00:02:43.019> moving<00:02:44.019> around

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
get all our stuff in there moving around

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.059 
get all our stuff in there moving around
to<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.799> back<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.819> we<00:02:45.940> can<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.209> course<00:02:46.450> see

to the back and we can of course see

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.160 
to the back and we can of course see
there's<00:02:48.069> two<00:02:48.340> holes<00:02:48.640> here<00:02:48.819> for<00:02:49.420> water<00:02:49.660> cooling

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
there's two holes here for water cooling

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.890 
when you figure out which way to push
and<00:02:57.910> then<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.239> push<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.480> through<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
and then you just push it through and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500 
and then you just push it through and
every<00:02:59.019> probably<00:02:59.319> snap<00:02:59.560> pop<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.430> out<00:03:00.510> there

will help them gain a few extra points
for<00:03:18.069> me<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:18.519> recently<00:03:18.940> i've<00:03:19.120> seen<00:03:19.329> some

power supply up at the top and that just

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.089 
power supply up at the top and that just
doesn't<00:03:25.720> work<00:03:25.870> for<00:03:26.019> me<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.349> don't<00:03:26.620> want<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:26.980> up

too<00:03:41.049> fancy<00:03:41.290> here<00:03:41.709> but<00:03:41.889> if<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.099> will<00:03:42.310> notice<00:03:42.609> it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
too fancy here but if you will notice it

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.690 
too fancy here but if you will notice it
is<00:03:43.060> kind<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.630> bulged<00:03:44.260> out<00:03:44.440> hopefully<00:03:45.280> this

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
is kind of bulged out hopefully this

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.849 
is kind of bulged out hopefully this
will<00:03:45.849> allow<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> bit<00:03:46.720> more<00:03:46.930> room<00:03:47.200> for<00:03:47.470> cable

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
will allow for a bit more room for cable

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.490 
will allow for a bit more room for cable
management<00:03:47.889> it'll<00:03:48.579> make<00:03:48.730> things<00:03:49.000> easier<00:03:49.569> even

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
management it'll make things easier even

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.080 
management it'll make things easier even
if<00:03:50.590> we<00:03:50.709> hopeful<00:03:51.220> probably<00:03:51.609> won't<00:03:51.760> be<00:03:51.880> able<00:03:51.970> to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
if we hopeful probably won't be able to

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.879 
if we hopeful probably won't be able to
route<00:03:52.299> them<00:03:52.540> exactly<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.200> way<00:03:53.319> we<00:03:53.349> want<00:03:53.739> at

route them exactly the way we want at

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.920 
route them exactly the way we want at
least<00:03:53.919> there<00:03:54.280> should<00:03:54.310> be<00:03:54.730> enough<00:03:55.150> room<00:03:55.569> to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
least there should be enough room to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.539 
least there should be enough room to
hide<00:03:56.139> them<00:03:56.349> behind<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.829> motherboard<00:03:57.310> tray

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
hide them behind the motherboard tray

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.819 
hide them behind the motherboard tray
which<00:03:58.359> in<00:03:58.540> some<00:03:58.750> cases<00:03:58.810> I've<00:03:59.379> run<00:03:59.590> into<00:03:59.739> a

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
which in some cases I've run into a

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.539 
which in some cases I've run into a
problem<00:04:00.069> with<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.500> before<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:02.859> get<00:04:03.099> into

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
problem with that and before we get into

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.430 
problem with that and before we get into
it<00:04:03.790> let's<00:04:04.239> just<00:04:04.299> take<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.599> quick<00:04:04.959> look<00:04:05.139> at<00:04:05.319> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
it let's just take a quick look at the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.059 
it let's just take a quick look at the
top<00:04:05.769> here<00:04:06.959> now<00:04:07.959> as<00:04:08.109> we<00:04:08.379> can<00:04:08.560> see<00:04:08.739> we<00:04:08.769> have<00:04:09.040> our

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
top here now as we can see we have our

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.490 
top here now as we can see we have our
power<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.879> reset<00:04:10.480> buttons<00:04:10.540> there<00:04:11.169> and

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
power and reset buttons there and

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.409 
power and reset buttons there and
there's<00:04:12.069> almost<00:04:12.280> kind<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:13.000> looking<00:04:13.209> at<00:04:13.389> it

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
there's almost kind of looking at it

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.939 
there's almost kind of looking at it
like<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.290> almost<00:04:14.530> looks<00:04:14.769> like<00:04:14.859> a

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
like this it almost looks like a

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.099 
like this it almost looks like a
transformer<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.970> me<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.359> don't<00:04:16.840> know<00:04:16.930> if<00:04:17.019> you

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
transformer to me I don't know if you

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.719 
transformer to me I don't know if you
can<00:04:17.229> see<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.530> but<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.680> kind<00:04:18.039> of<00:04:18.130> have<00:04:18.310> like<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
can see it but you kind of have like the

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.930 
can see it but you kind of have like the
eyes<00:04:18.910> there<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:19.979> I'm<00:04:20.979> sure<00:04:21.250> some<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.729> will

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
eyes there and I'm sure some of you will

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.930 
eyes there and I'm sure some of you will
see<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.740> there's<00:04:23.740> also<00:04:23.890> a<00:04:24.070> little<00:04:24.430> extra<00:04:24.789> bit

see it there's also a little extra bit

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.710 
see it there's also a little extra bit
of<00:04:25.000> vented<00:04:25.450> air

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
of vented air

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.320 
of vented air
here<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.230> plastic<00:04:26.860> which<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:27.790> kind<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.150> odd

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
here in the plastic which is kind of odd

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.000 
here in the plastic which is kind of odd
to<00:04:28.750> me<00:04:28.780> cuz<00:04:29.050> they<00:04:29.110> haven't<00:04:29.410> done<00:04:29.440> on<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.860> other

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
to me cuz they haven't done on the other

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.140 
to me cuz they haven't done on the other
side<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:31.300> again<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.470> budget<00:04:33.070> case<00:04:33.340> any<00:04:33.700> extra

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
side but again a budget case any extra

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.650 
side but again a budget case any extra
chance<00:04:34.420> for<00:04:34.660> airflow<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.350> always<00:04:35.770> good<00:04:36.070> oh<00:04:36.660> so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
chance for airflow is always good oh so

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.030 
chance for airflow is always good oh so
yeah<00:04:37.810> what<00:04:38.050> we're<00:04:38.170> going<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.350> do<00:04:38.500> now<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:38.920> I'm
