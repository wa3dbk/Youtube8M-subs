00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
pan on down and so I'm doing a quick

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.540 
pan on down and so I'm doing a quick
gesture<00:00:34.210> and<00:00:34.629> what<00:00:35.470> am<00:00:35.589> I<00:00:35.739> thinking<00:00:35.769> about<00:00:36.339> now

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
gesture and what am I thinking about now

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.069 
gesture and what am I thinking about now
when<00:00:36.790> I'm<00:00:36.909> doing<00:00:37.059> this<00:00:37.329> I'm<00:00:37.510> thinking<00:00:37.870> about

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
when I'm doing this I'm thinking about

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.290 
when I'm doing this I'm thinking about
the<00:00:38.260> peanut<00:00:38.559> shape<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.309> I'm<00:00:39.489> not<00:00:39.730> drawing<00:00:40.059> each

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
the peanut shape so I'm not drawing each

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.060 
the peanut shape so I'm not drawing each
individual<00:00:40.930> toe<00:00:41.170> first<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.710> would<00:00:41.800> be<00:00:41.920> like

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
individual toe first that would be like

drawing<00:00:44.229> the<00:00:44.440> overall<00:00:44.920> shape<00:00:44.949> of<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.760> bottom

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089

of<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.329> foot<00:00:46.540> inside<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.290> a<00:00:47.379> gesture<00:00:47.800> alright

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
of the foot inside of a gesture alright

so now what I'm going to do is get in a

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.680 
so now what I'm going to do is get in a
little<00:00:50.980> bit<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> lower<00:00:51.850> leg<00:00:53.519> and<00:00:54.519> as<00:00:55.059> I'm

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
little bit of the lower leg and as I'm

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.919 
little bit of the lower leg and as I'm
doing<00:00:55.899> this<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.469> my<00:00:56.859> mind<00:00:57.190> I<00:00:57.519> am<00:00:58.059> so<00:00:58.480> thinking

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.139 
doing this in my mind I am so thinking
about<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.530> angles<00:00:59.949> right<00:01:00.160> now<00:01:00.370> but<00:01:00.879> i'm<00:01:01.000> not

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
about the angles right now but i'm not

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.450 
about the angles right now but i'm not
drawing<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.780> angles<00:01:02.140> i<00:01:02.230> could<00:01:02.530> but<00:01:03.160> i<00:01:03.219> don't

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
drawing the angles i could but i don't

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.889 
drawing the angles i could but i don't
want<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.820> i<00:01:03.850> want<00:01:03.999> to<00:01:04.269> just<00:01:04.390> draw<00:01:04.570> in<00:01:04.660> my<00:01:04.780> own

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
want to i want to just draw in my own

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.139 
want to i want to just draw in my own
style<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.440> now<00:01:05.590> i'm<00:01:06.100> going<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.369> come<00:01:06.789> on<00:01:06.970> in

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
style so now i'm going to come on in

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.279 
style so now i'm going to come on in
here<00:01:07.300> i'm<00:01:07.420> looking<00:01:07.690> at<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.869> negative<00:01:08.170> space

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
here i'm looking at the negative space

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.380 
here i'm looking at the negative space
and<00:01:08.800> you<00:01:09.490> know<00:01:09.580> i<00:01:09.610> could<00:01:09.940> pull<00:01:10.179> a<00:01:10.210> line

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
and you know i could pull a line

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.090 
and you know i could pull a line
straight<00:01:10.690> across<00:01:10.929> from<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.380> ankle

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.730 

everything's<00:01:15.100> just<00:01:15.420> subtly<00:01:16.420> it's<00:01:16.899> such<00:01:17.380> not<00:01:17.710> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
everything's just subtly it's such not a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.520 
everything's just subtly it's such not a
straight<00:01:18.280> line<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.929> then<00:01:19.929> we've<00:01:20.110> got<00:01:20.140> this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
straight line and then we've got this

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.480 
straight line and then we've got this
one<00:01:23.280> metatarsal<00:01:24.280> /<00:01:24.750> phalanx<00:01:25.750> that<00:01:26.189> bows<00:01:27.189> out

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
one metatarsal / phalanx that bows out

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.399 
one metatarsal / phalanx that bows out
over<00:01:27.880> there<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.210> as<00:01:28.479> I'm<00:01:28.659> now<00:01:28.869> i'm<00:01:29.020> working<00:01:29.350> on

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
over there so as I'm now i'm working on

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.940 
over there so as I'm now i'm working on
each<00:01:29.619> individual<00:01:30.189> toe<00:01:30.460> but<00:01:30.700> before<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.030> do<00:01:31.119> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
each individual toe but before I do that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.940 
each individual toe but before I do that
I'm<00:01:32.950> going<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.189> do<00:01:33.310> my<00:01:33.340> best<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.969> get<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.560> where

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
I'm going to do my best to get the where

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.950 
I'm going to do my best to get the where
the<00:01:36.070> bottom<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.759> foot<00:01:37.030> actually<00:01:37.600> meets

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the bottom of the foot actually meets

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.260 
the bottom of the foot actually meets
the<00:01:38.259> toes<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.890> then<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:39.820> thing<00:01:39.969> is<00:01:40.090> going<00:01:40.180> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
the toes and then this thing is going to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.780 
the toes and then this thing is going to
wrap<00:01:40.570> around<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.290> that's<00:01:41.860> kind<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.250> bulging

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
wrap around and that's kind of bulging

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.109 
wrap around and that's kind of bulging
out<00:01:43.020> we've<00:01:44.020> got<00:01:44.229> tons<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.920> folds<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.520> skin<00:01:45.700> over

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
out we've got tons of folds of skin over

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
out we've got tons of folds of skin over
here<00:01:46.299> that<00:01:46.450> are<00:01:46.539> wrapping<00:01:46.990> around<00:01:47.049> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.170 

gravity<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.219> going<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.399> pull<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.909> down

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
gravity is going to pull that down

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.510 
gravity is going to pull that down
slightly<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.350> I'm<00:01:53.409> really<00:01:53.619> use<00:01:53.860> an<00:01:54.009> organic

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
slightly so I'm really use an organic

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.950 
slightly so I'm really use an organic
line<00:01:54.759> so<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.689> my<00:01:55.869> heel<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.750> sometimes<00:01:58.750> if

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
line so this is my heel and sometimes if

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.170 
line so this is my heel and sometimes if
you<00:01:59.350> know<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.590> malls<00:01:59.799> walking<00:02:00.219> in<00:02:00.310> class<00:02:00.549> this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
you know the malls walking in class this

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.679 
you know the malls walking in class this
heel<00:02:01.570> pad<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:02.109> going<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.409> be<00:02:02.590> really<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.689> little

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
heel pad is going to be really a little

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.389 
heel pad is going to be really a little
bit<00:02:04.869> darker<00:02:05.049> than<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.500> middle<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:06.070> arch<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
different than the planes right now from

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.390 
different than the planes right now from
this<00:02:36.400> point<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.880> view<00:02:36.910> with<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> foot<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.400> be

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
this point of view with a foot so be

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.710 
this point of view with a foot so be
careful<00:02:39.820> when<00:02:39.940> you're<00:02:40.030> drawing<00:02:40.240> these<00:02:40.450> toes
