00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 minecraft video and today i want to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 imagine the snapshot 12 40h 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 I can already say this in advance 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.240
 snapshot is not that amazing either 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.240
 Great 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.150
 The first innovation is that the texture 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.430
 the witch was changed for example 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.349
 So at least the hat is now sitting 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.570
 So a bit weird as you see 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.920
 and yes, a little bit changed 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.600
 besides, I do not know if it is now 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.370
 already in the last snapshot or before that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.440
 the witch rob was now something now 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.239
 not moment I'll show it up 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.150
 every drop also drops from time to time 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.860
 whatever if it happens 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.600
 who can drink with others now 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.000
 I throw in the ruin , for example 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.210
 is ranked by the get and see here 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.220
 you for example last and spider id 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.260
 has me then synonymous glas bottles brand 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.260
 dropped then has me once again a 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.520
 stick dropped and can definitely 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.060
 yes, you drink with others 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 monastery and even the troupe so everything 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.090
 I do not think that things are so good now 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.979
 you can change maybe that's it 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.310
 is that now unconscious or something 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.200
 here in the tickets for example it very much 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 good if there is a certain thing 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.310
 and not something excessive turn but 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.700
 Well 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.580
 maybe it is only temporary and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.410
 yes that too much a case 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.690
 you can snapshot since the penultimate snapshot 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.450
 I think even now new flat world 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.430
 create and spawn in this now 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.250
 example like that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.490
 dungeons or jamin shed depending on 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.830
 if you have such a sand flat world 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.480
 has been cacti or something here 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.880
 temple 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.350
 but there is something else and that 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.410
 if you are such a normal flat world 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.050
 has tons or yes generate on this 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.720
 flat world even on trees and yes that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.300
 I think that's pretty good 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.979
 Furthermore, you can open buttons 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.450
 switch and wrong only with one 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.450
 right-click 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.120
 it applies now to all here and with 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.150
 a left click would do that then 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.590
 break down and that does not work 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.709
 So you can only with one 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.620
 right click also was the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.540
 pick blog function which one under 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.030
 set options and controls here 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 It is then stop button 3 which is 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.930
 with me now on the mausrad 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.320
 yes the dysfunction is also wrong now 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.750
 items and the spread or 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.780
 spread of the fire was also 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 was changed again there are unfortunately 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.010
 another thing about the snapshot and about that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.170
 Unfortunately I can not say anything exactly 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.840
 can only explain you the function and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.350
 although if you press the hotkeys 1 to 9 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.890
 meanwhile mouse or so here this 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.970
 crosshair hovers over an item 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.510
 because on the side so in 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.330
 quotes floats yes and if 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.030
 you stop the hotkeys 19 presses 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.740
 this page was right in your slot but 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.360
 how exactly that worked now 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.480
 I said that unfortunately I do not know 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.920
 that the only thing else is there 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.520
 Of course bugfix is like in everyone 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.680
 snapshot reflex just so sorry yes else 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.250
 bugfixes team everyone like everyone else 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.110
 snapshot yes that was s then installation 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.730
 I'll show you this right now 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.620
 net is actually okay but 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.540
 there are also things you do not now 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.030
 absolutely needs such as the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.610
 big block function for items or that 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.700
 with the hot keys i find now 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.500
 actually not really useful 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.030
 I know regulation would result in what by 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.100
 window i do not know exactly how it is 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.690
 is not so bad now 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.030
 is now beside functions the important ones 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.070
 I have explained and then say things 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.080
