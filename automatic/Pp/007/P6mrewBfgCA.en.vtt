00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.469
 Goo 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.469
 The essential filter for ornamental fish breeding has the following role 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.560
 At first we remove big garbage which we can see 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:28.840
 Physical filtration 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:33.010
 And from the leftovers of bait and the excrement of ornamental fish, etc. 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.350
 Decomposition of harmful ammonia etc. generated 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:44.490
 Biological filtration to be harmless 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:50.550
 Furthermore, adsorption filtration which removes impurities in the water tank using firewood etc 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:54.920
 Can be ornamental fish live comfortably by combining these three 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.920
 A beautiful aquarium is completed 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:05.080
 At first filter medium which is set to filter of water crop removes big garbage 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:12.040
 Perform physical filtration 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:17.620
 And it decomposes the ammonia and nitrous acid harmful to ornamental fish and it becomes harmless immediately 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 The unique design allows for a large amount of filtration bacteria to propagate well 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.240
 Realize biofiltration 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:34.240
 Submersible pump type that can be freely laid out with excellent filtration capacity for filters made of water 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.280
 With New Space Power Fit 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.320
 Airlift type that efficiently supplies oxygen with fine bubbles 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.390
 There is a water production eight 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.630
 Water production eight is indeed more than sm 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.510
 45 to 60 cm for aquarium 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.200
 Mizusaku New Flower Deluxe 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.200
 There is also a watercraft jumbo that can be used for ponds etc. 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:11.069
 You can listen to the size of the aquarium and the aquarium fish to be cheeked 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:17.340
 Also separate from the abrasives of both series 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:22.370
 Cartridges can be bed-set for the purpose of water quality such as activated carbon etc. 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.370
 It is also possible to change according to the breeding environment 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.939
 For a while after setting the filter 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 There are few filtration bacteria in tank 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:36.610
 Leftovers of bait and hun can not be decomposed 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:44.730
 Cause of cloudiness 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.730
 Ammonia etc. may generate a lot and damage the ornamental fish. 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:54.860
 In the early teak period, decrease the number of teak ornamental fish 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.790
 Let's try to reduce the amount of food 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.060
 If you start to worry about the dirt on the filter again 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.680
 Immersed in water to remove the filter material 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:12.209
 Let's wash away attached waste products 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.209
 Please replace it with a new one if the fibers on the surface are fluffed
