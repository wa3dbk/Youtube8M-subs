00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.630

 do not leave it anything because the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.850

 sealed already saw it change the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.660
 good color then let's pass it 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.160
 it's that easy 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.490
 to this norm 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.290
 we pay it here 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.269
 and we're going 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.019
 to mix of course so that our 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:51.900
 product fits us perfectly well 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.290
 we are going to mix the jar of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.290
 isi 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.310
 with a little bit of vinegar 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.370
 a splash also apple cider vinegar 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.650
 of the isi because it really is apple 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.140
 it's not concentrated like all the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.500
 competition that is very important 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.330
 notice what they buy is it ' that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.560
 is for sale in all supermarkets 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.560
 from the country 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.120
 we cast the minister here 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.540
 to mix a little 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.049
 very good now let's put 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.319
 when I speak 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.270
 the rest 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.330
 a crack 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.000
 that easy and you saw how fast good 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.430
 It will be delicious 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.969
 you are going to realize 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.750
 and here it goes to the oven we cover it and 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.390
 we put to bake that's all after 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.940
 a 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.500
 now more or less because the spine is sewn 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.860
 very fast and we are going to insert 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.630
 a knife if you see that it is hard 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.630
 how right now is that they are raw 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.079
 but if the loin is inserted very well it is already 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.079
 Cooked 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.020
