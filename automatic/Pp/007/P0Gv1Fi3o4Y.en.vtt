00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.770
 completely best viewers of fish I build 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.139
 here again with new video with lower 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.639
 call of duty ghosts game play 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.250
 I play a blitz on my map here 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.140
 corner and I get a streak where 15 Jun 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.240
 it mainly concerns and this video 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.170
 is the way my 15 artificial cane 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.240
 will be ended 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.830
 but that is really not about anything 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.080
 I just let that and that 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.120
 whole killcam because all you explain how 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.059
 I die that's really abnormal I think 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.320
 you played with the a12 with silencer yourself 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.180
 and extent merckx 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.130
 one of the best combinations in the game 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.670
 really a super good weapon if you remember that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.650
 didn't know 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.260
 definitely try it out it's just really one 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.149
 super thin i am here with the purge radio 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.079
 on quick dry sticks fully loaded and 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.390
 center line 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.600
 and I promise as a specialist burks 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.760
 smart vent wire tap and detail and if 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.070
 specialist bonuses luck tic write you 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.320
 focus of crashes and blows soul 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.820
 I really want to get rid of all those Turkish people 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.300
 have the beginning but it is possible 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.100
 not 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 focus is really just one 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.410
 audience from the start 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.360
 use 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.890
 only i absolutely don't know what i am leaving 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.229
 would like to do I think another one 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.670
 center line or reload the only center line 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.530
 I also really really mind 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.049
 handy because then you just kill or 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.679
 point less need to be your first putter 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.469
 to paint 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.209
 and it saw that all your axis can be counted as 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.069
 once or at least two year system 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.420
 counted as one time, and I get on for 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.929
 much like Christians in call of duty 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.929
 ghosts 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.189
 so i'm still in doubt about that 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.049
 do where I don't know 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.939
 focus is just a very useful tool 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.950
 makes sure you don't give the you 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.200
 get kick if you are hit by 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.209
 one and who in their site because of that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.880
 do you still press and often die and you have 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:43.880
 actually i always have when i view 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.520
 click that my that my site above 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.249
 the adam ' only flies if i have another 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.229
 enemy duke i go there his site 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.909
 right on my head making me fast 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.649
 die so I think that's a bit like that 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.990
 looked annoying from the view in call or 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.329
 Duty but yes I would really agree 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.829
 those focuses turn into pollination works 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.739
 have to process only i have to be there 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.419
 just think about what purge i am 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.659
 then to change how I am doing 

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.219
 to do 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.860
 I still don't know what I am talking about 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.170
 preferably use in terms of specialist and lock 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.440
 think was brush artworks and all the dg 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.500
 I also think that is a very caulfield 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.840
 posts the not really a certain set comes 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.610
 which is simply the best thing to do with 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 the beginning i think in this game just 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.420
 really multiple things are how you can 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.640
 and how to get the press in which case 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.260
 just the common paint is so only yes 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.240
 maybe that is respect again 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.520
 nice so it's not the same every time 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.860
 is that you play with the same Turkish 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.930
 then just what variation is and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.220
 it is still good to use 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.230
 that determined 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.210
 that only a certain combination 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.420
 at least the that's where it is in this 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.500
 video is already you 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.390
 I want to thank you for looking 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.340
