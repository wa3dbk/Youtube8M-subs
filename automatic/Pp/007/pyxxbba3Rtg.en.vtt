the ability to stop slow or reverse time

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.050 
the ability to stop slow or reverse time
is<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.140> sensational<00:02:27.730> suppose<00:02:28.730> you're<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
is just sensational suppose you're in a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.720 
is just sensational suppose you're in a
gunfight<00:02:29.270> 5<00:02:29.959> vs<00:02:30.590> yourself<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:31.640> you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
gunfight 5 vs yourself and you know you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.449 
gunfight 5 vs yourself and you know you
cannot<00:02:32.060> win<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.720> simply<00:02:33.350> stop<00:02:33.650> time<00:02:33.920> or<00:02:34.160> slow

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
cannot win just simply stop time or slow

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.790 
cannot win just simply stop time or slow
it<00:02:34.489> down<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.030> must<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.480> shoot<00:02:35.989> them<00:02:36.140> but

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
it down if you must and shoot them but

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the downside of this is that it only

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.630 
the downside of this is that it only
lasts<00:02:39.260> for<00:02:39.290> no<00:02:39.500> longer<00:02:39.680> than<00:02:39.800> five<00:02:40.100> seconds
