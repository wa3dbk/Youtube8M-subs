00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.210
 the people here are again opinions 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.240
 get tutorial for another year 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 the late 3 this time is about the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.690
 boston tea party or on sequence 6 and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.240
 because I believe the emission and there 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.730
 you have to start with all four boxes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.380
 throw into the water and then there are 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.180
 another two different task 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.970
 On the one hand , some have to deal with assassinations 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.429
 a musket through and feel 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.920
 at the same time then afterwards come back 

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.449
 throw in the water and both are there 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.129
 relatively the tips and I want 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:44.179
 you showed here so the first part 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.179
 to do the lyrics and with 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 as soon as we have done that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.879
 We often produce other things 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.300
 can still complete and there in each 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.300
 languages 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.450
 plan and what if you can contact her 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.479
 in the end at the controls 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.560
 establishment of such and then with still 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.560
 once from purchase 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.350
 that's actually going to have to be private 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.750
 with one coming closer and ours 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.530
 Left click and then has the noon 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.439
 completed 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.310
 so now we go out on this page 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.799
 tried to throw into the water there 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.049
 deport 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.490
 So as I said here expresses the one 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.100
 Checkout means it could wait until the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.170
 has uncovered churches and 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.970
 then press in the appropriate 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.009
 direction where the water is again 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.929
 it is relative to the contrasts 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.459
 just like moving into the water one 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.190
 regard to twitter not on the 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.970
 others are waiting 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.970
 relatively good 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:17.420
 counter right and there you see again 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 the game does not make a hit 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.989
 important as you have just seen 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.840
 However, it is basically with me 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.390
 tf2 of 305 one of my heroes about the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 has lost relatively cool life and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.420
 really do not want the state at 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.989
 the amazons also not 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.989
 completed 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.209
 so I am here and do just that 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.209
 same with the next 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.680
 I immediately cut out 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.600
 for a speaker and there would have the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.190
 last water wine and so have the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.630
 mission also the tekken end effect 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.050
 We managed and learn it here 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.050
 provide 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.040
 but to see and you do not have to 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.030
 let it discourage if the game 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.380
 have to bake and sometimes the single child 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.840
 if your lighting plant is not 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.780
 missing what ever happens to me but 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:46.350
 the methodical two times contact is 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.350
 one that runs relatively reliably 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.319
 others are 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
 90 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.700
 People 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.949
 and we did it 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:22.130
 it is folk and yes that was fast yes 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.840
 and humans are exactly like that 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.919
 finished and complete with 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.520
 have in twitter my channels 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.050
 will be even more are full throttle 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.210
 I liked fancy events 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.210
 want to have a nice day doing it now
