and tap that on my eyeball I mean I used
a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:55.979> oh<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> black<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> gray<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a lot oh I use the black and the gray I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
a lot oh I use the black and the gray I
mean<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.439> used<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.159> lot<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> these<00:01:59.670> eyeshadows

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
mean I used a lot of these eyeshadows

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
mean I used a lot of these eyeshadows
and<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:01.290> blend<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.579> well<00:02:03.560> if<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and they blend really really well if I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
and they blend really really well if I
had<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.130> compare<00:02:05.159> them<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> any<00:02:06.090> eyeshadow

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
had to compare them to any eyeshadow

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.830 
had to compare them to any eyeshadow
formula<00:02:07.530> they're<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:08.069> reminiscent<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:09.119> max

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
formula they're very reminiscent of max

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140

formula<00:02:10.590> some<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> little<00:02:11.849> less

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
