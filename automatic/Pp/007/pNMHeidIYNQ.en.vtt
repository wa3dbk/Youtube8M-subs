hey guys Tom Nelson weld craft here the
guys<00:00:15.320> in<00:00:15.469> the<00:00:15.530> factory<00:00:15.950> asked<00:00:16.129> me<00:00:16.219> to<00:00:16.309> come<00:00:16.430> up

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
guys in the factory asked me to come up

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.240 
guys in the factory asked me to come up
with<00:00:16.610> ten<00:00:16.910> things<00:00:17.210> that<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:17.990> love<00:00:18.410> about<00:00:18.740> this

with ten things that I love about this

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.670 
with ten things that I love about this
haul<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.730> I'm<00:00:19.790> not<00:00:20.240> sure<00:00:20.509> I<00:00:20.689> can<00:00:20.810> keep<00:00:21.110> it<00:00:21.290> to

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
haul and I'm not sure I can keep it to

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.890 
haul and I'm not sure I can keep it to
10<00:00:21.950> but<00:00:22.550> we'll<00:00:22.939> give<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.210> shot<00:00:23.240> follow<00:00:23.750> me

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
10 but we'll give it a shot follow me

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
10 but we'll give it a shot follow me
around<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.230> boat<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.680> you'll<00:00:24.950> see<00:00:25.099> what<00:00:25.250> I<00:00:25.279> mean

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
around a boat and you'll see what I mean

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.609 
around a boat and you'll see what I mean
the<00:00:27.920> source<00:00:28.279> of<00:00:28.609> weld<00:00:29.090> crafts<00:00:29.570> smooth<00:00:30.289> ride

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
the source of weld crafts smooth ride

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.369 
the source of weld crafts smooth ride
and<00:00:30.890> great<00:00:31.250> handling<00:00:31.849> is<00:00:32.000> its<00:00:32.419> reverse<00:00:32.809> shine

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
and great handling is its reverse shine

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.140 
and great handling is its reverse shine
so<00:00:33.949> we're<00:00:34.070> talking<00:00:34.370> about<00:00:34.460> this<00:00:34.670> surface

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
so we're talking about this surface

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.030 
so we're talking about this surface
right<00:00:35.360> here<00:00:35.660> what<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:36.260> does<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.739> gives<00:00:36.769> the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
right here what this does it gives the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.840 
right here what this does it gives the
boat<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.400> tremendous<00:00:38.269> amount<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.780> lift<00:00:39.850> as

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
boat a tremendous amount of lift as

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.240 
boat a tremendous amount of lift as
you're<00:00:41.150> making<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> turn<00:00:42.080> that<00:00:42.769> you're<00:00:43.129> going

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
you're making a turn that you're going

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.250 
you're making a turn that you're going
to<00:00:43.309> get<00:00:43.460> lift<00:00:43.699> on<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:43.970> side<00:00:44.239> that's<00:00:44.870> that's

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
to get lift on the side that's that's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.930 
to get lift on the side that's that's
descending<00:00:45.979> into<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.190> water<00:00:46.460> column<00:00:46.729> you're

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
descending into the water column you're

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.280 
descending into the water column you're
here<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.150> get<00:00:47.239> section<00:00:47.720> on<00:00:47.839> the<00:00:47.900> side<00:00:48.080> that's

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
here to get section on the side that's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.630 
here to get section on the side that's
going<00:00:48.440> up<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:48.739> can<00:00:48.830> get<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:48.949> very<00:00:49.220> stable

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
going up so you can get a very stable

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.910 
going up so you can get a very stable
ride<00:00:50.030> but<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.900> best<00:00:51.140> part<00:00:51.409> about<00:00:51.470> reverse

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
ride but the best part about reverse

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.369 
ride but the best part about reverse
chine<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.549> when<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.119> go<00:00:53.330> hit<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.600> wave<00:00:53.900> that

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
chine is when you go hit a wave that

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.399 
chine is when you go hit a wave that
lifts<00:00:54.769> it<00:00:55.040> gets<00:00:55.369> created<00:00:55.970> stops<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.930> boat<00:00:57.110> for

lifts it gets created stops the boat for

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.350 
lifts it gets created stops the boat for
pounding<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.250> anytime<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:58.760> can<00:00:58.850> reduce<00:00:59.119> that

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
pounding and anytime you can reduce that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.789 
pounding and anytime you can reduce that
it's<00:00:59.510> going<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.690> keep<00:00:59.839> you<00:01:00.019> fresher<00:01:00.379> all<00:01:00.650> day
