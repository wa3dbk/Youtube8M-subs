00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.170
 good afternoon dear submarines in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.099
 this video we will review as 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.420
 Would pro technical characteristics 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.990
 underwater guns melt muddyak 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.830
 and Zelensky's underwater gun here 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 the main purpose of this video is to highlight what 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 guns float muddyak on their 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 characteristics close to the gun 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 Zelensky system but has a price 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.880
 significantly lower than the gun system 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 Zelensky means so at prices 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.100
 Christmas average is worth 4 thousand 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.969
 hryvnia well masters of his performance 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.290
 we are waiting for a high-quality reliable gun 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.829
 lagoon muddyak 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.050
 has a price somewhere 2002 UAH 200 in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 currency dependence 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 many take the link because of the average 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.539
 handle location or because 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 arrangement mitts 2 3 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.090
 the same thing we have in this already Glinka 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.270
 made of corrosion resistant titanium 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 material already muddy 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.580
 from stainless too basket resistant 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.520
 material that is inferior to titanium only 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.850
 the only thing is that it is heavier than titanium 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 although here those to receivers 6 and handbrake 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 feel like heavy on 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.670
 Zelensky's weight next 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.430
 advantage is active not reset 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 Here in this section is implemented exactly 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.350
 does the active line reset that is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.960
 these criteria guns again match 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.829
 the only thing is the plan is inferior 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.369
 cuttings 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.329
 so that Zelenka has a little bit more 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.090
 piston stroke 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.329
 respectively, the efficiency of the gun will be more 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.659
 here but is it worth overpaying conditionally for 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:59.030
 10-15 percent power per shotgun amount 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:03.030
 twice you decide each his own 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.880
 guns descent in Zelenka should 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.930
 be softer than in the creek and mutnyak afloat but 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.920
 when i was charging 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.950
 and shot out the contentment of the gun I especially 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.250
 softness in the difference between these 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.810
 I did not notice the time especially when I was 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.519
 five millimeter glove all good 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.519
