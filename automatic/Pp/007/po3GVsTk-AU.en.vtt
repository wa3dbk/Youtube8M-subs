00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello on this day I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.379
 make doorknobs in a way 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.480
 very easy low cost for you to change 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.530
 a radical way the appearance of 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.530
 your furniture 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 we are going to need white clay 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.910
 approximately half a kilo goes to one 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.330
 with 40 spatulas to model brushes 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.330
 acrylic paint nuts and bolts 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.359
 we are going to try that the cones are what 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.760
 most similar possible between them by 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.390
 that we are going to think about them and they have to be 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.659
 250 grams of weight we model them between 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.280
 hands or on top of a surface and 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.399
 and when we think it has achieved 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.519
 the perfect way what we do is that 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.210
 we introduce a pressure screw and 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:08.110
 then we cover it so that the part 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.140
 wider screw on the head of the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.600
 screw is completely covered and as 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.539
 you see what we are going to need is a 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.899
 little bit of water to skim the 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.759
 surface and thus removing the cracks 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.830
 that we have been able to train that they have not 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.470
 made that a figure is completely 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.300
 perfect and also the part by which 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.300
 we have introduced the screw 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.980
 once made the perfect way has 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.410
 past the water introduced the screw 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.110
 we have to let it dry 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.140
 approximately 24 hours and once 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.940
 dried we look at the designs we want 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.940
 do it at the time of painting 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.490
 it is advisable to paint a background and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.829
 from that background that we have painted 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.960
 you can start doing the design that 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.239
 we have chosen or that we go 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.629
 inventing along the way how was a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.120
 acrylic paint at 10 minutes a 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.730
 thing if it is already completely dry I 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.370
 I took a piece of porexpan and I am 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.739
 putting there for good as support to 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.470
 the time to dry the shapes at the time of 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.540
 paint it comes great and 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.579
 it's just that painting 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.739
 I'm going to teach this model that is the 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.989
 of painting you can also do it 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.299
 covering it with crochet making it a 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.400
 founds like the white you taught before 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.049
 here what I am using is a 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.269
 glue droplet that I put in the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.209
 center because I'm going to apply a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.480
 little bit of glitter for that the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.209
 Glitter plastic pieces of paper 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.879
 made on top of the glue with a clamp 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.680
 and when about 5 minutes have passed 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.379
 What I do is clean it with a brush 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.150
 to remove the excess of these dots 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.310
 that we have left 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 once it has dried what I do is 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.790
 make her the flowers of the daisy 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 flower the base color and then I will go 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.120
 superimposing other touches of color 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.360
 with white for example what I 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.069
 you will see what it is that you applied to give it a 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.590
 little as of texture I apply the 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.349
 brushstrokes and then I'm passing the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.650
 fingertip I pass the yolk once a 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:34.870
 a gentle touch and clean the finger and so 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.870
 I will go making the flower 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.440
 i 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.910
 and that's how our few have been 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.980
 for the doors just now just 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.130
 we have to put at our door 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.310
 wardrobe or whatever and gives a touch 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.410
 very colorful it changes it totally and the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.140
 truth is that it comes out with about 40 cents 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.240
 about doing a little bit of this 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.950
 I hope you liked this day and 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.950
 see you in another video bye bye
