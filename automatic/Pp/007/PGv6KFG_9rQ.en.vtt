 to get 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 it's pretty simple, just red with 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.739
 white stripes but it is between it 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 normal length and headed in this as 18 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.989
 euros 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.590

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.039
 work 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.289
 it's just the massiere but the substance 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.750
 is so nice and soft 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.189
 just really soft fabric and this shirt 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.010
 like 22 euros and I prefer to eat 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:17.210

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.210
 bought two necklace first this one 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:27.430
 he is not gold in distress it is 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.960
 it says on marley and this means 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.400

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 this one is gold 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.440
 one chain of 6 euros and the other was 8 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.380
 but can certainly choose which one 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.369
 but I think always 8 euros and that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.630
 with crack that because yes mistakes the form but 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.310
