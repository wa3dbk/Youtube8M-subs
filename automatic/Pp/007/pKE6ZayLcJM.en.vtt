of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.630> blender<00:01:54.930> attachments<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
of the blender attachments so this is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
of the blender attachments so this is

this comes with all of the models so

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.700 
this comes with all of the models so
this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.180> base<00:02:00.410> attachment<00:02:01.410> this<00:02:01.530> does

blending crushes ice so that other
attachment<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.150> called<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> grinding

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
attachment is called the grinding

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.300 
attachment is called the grinding
attachment<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.890> grind<00:02:08.100> coffee

attachment I think and grind coffee

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.000 
attachment I think and grind coffee
beans<00:02:08.460> with<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.840> grind<00:02:10.050> spices<00:02:10.380> with

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010

beans with it you can grind spices with
it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.160 
it
but<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.210> use<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:12.870> is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
but the thing that I use it for is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.670 
but the thing that I use it for is
actually<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.220> grinding<00:02:15.150> flax<00:02:15.450> seeds<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.350> flax

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
actually for grinding flax seeds so flax

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.800 
actually for grinding flax seeds so flax
seeds<00:02:16.950> that's<00:02:17.460> it's<00:02:17.730> fantastic<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.570> you

eat flax seeds they're also called Ian
seeds<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.280> well<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> thing<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.260> flax

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
seeds as well and the thing with flax

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550 
seeds as well and the thing with flax
seeds<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.540> actually<00:02:31.080> can't<00:02:31.320> digest

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
seeds is that you actually can't digest

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.190 
seeds is that you actually can't digest
them<00:02:31.980> whole<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.550> they're<00:02:33.330> quite<00:02:33.540> big<00:02:33.900> little

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
them whole so they're quite big little

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200 
them whole so they're quite big little
seeds<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.950> sprinkle<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.580> cereal

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
seeds so if you sprinkle that on cereal

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.450 
seeds so if you sprinkle that on cereal
or<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.840> kind<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.230> eat<00:02:37.500> some<00:02:37.800> they

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
or if you just kind of eat some they

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.460 
or if you just kind of eat some they
actually<00:02:38.850> don't<00:02:39.540> digest<00:02:39.750> when<00:02:40.200> they're<00:02:40.320> like

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
actually don't digest when they're like

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.820 
actually don't digest when they're like
this<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.820> also<00:02:42.060> already<00:02:42.750> buy<00:02:43.080> flax<00:02:43.530> seeds

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
this you can also already buy flax seeds

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.340 
this you can also already buy flax seeds
pre-ground<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:45.510> happens<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.050> they<00:02:46.200> actually

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
pre-ground what happens is they actually

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.560 
pre-ground what happens is they actually
oxidize<00:02:47.010> very<00:02:47.190> quickly<00:02:47.700> after<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.240> grind

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
oxidize very quickly after you grind

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.420 
oxidize very quickly after you grind
them<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> stuff<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.040> buy<00:02:50.220> that's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
them so the stuff that you buy that's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.490 
them so the stuff that you buy that's
already<00:02:50.850> ground<00:02:51.270> has<00:02:51.690> probably<00:02:52.020> most<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.320> most

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
already ground has probably most of most

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.890 
already ground has probably most of most
of<00:02:52.620> its<00:02:52.770> nutrients<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.750> can

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
of its nutrients so it is you can

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.080 
of its nutrients so it is you can
actually<00:02:55.110> grind<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.190> your<00:02:56.220> flax<00:02:56.550> seeds<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
actually grind up your flax seeds to a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.300 
actually grind up your flax seeds to a
powder<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.780> include<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.040> daily

kale<00:03:48.370> off<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.420> stem<00:03:49.810> because<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:50.980> isn't<00:03:51.280> one

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370

with<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:58.140> wouldn't<00:03:59.140> stick<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.709> whole<00:03:59.860> stem<00:04:00.129> in

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
with I wouldn't stick the whole stem in

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.530 
with I wouldn't stick the whole stem in
there<00:04:00.400> because<00:04:00.640> it'll<00:04:00.970> probably<00:04:01.000> be<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.390> little

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
there because it'll probably be a little

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.190 
there because it'll probably be a little
bit<00:04:02.370> chewy<00:04:03.370> at<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.849> end<00:04:04.000> or<00:04:04.209> it's<00:04:04.360> gonna<00:04:04.480> still

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
bit chewy at the end or it's gonna still

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.770 
bit chewy at the end or it's gonna still
not<00:04:05.349> be<00:04:05.530> blended<00:04:06.010> down<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.090> would<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.510> pull

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
not be blended down so I would just pull

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.229 
not be blended down so I would just pull
it<00:04:07.840> off<00:04:08.160> because<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.370> don't<00:04:09.549> have<00:04:09.670> much<00:04:09.910> kale

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239
