 Surfer 13 m sure you 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.819
 you have seen everywhere is the brand 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.830
 of shampoo that I have used in 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.140
 last four years in particular this the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.569
 moisturizing is the shampoo that does not 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.069
 took off in years is the only 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.469
 conditioner that you give me tangles my hair 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.909
 really and now the good news is 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.989
 I 'm going to start working with 3m 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.299
 I am very happy because they will arrive 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.639
 very cool things from the hand of 3m and 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.609
 you will see and today I will show you how to get 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:28.310
 those waves your spheres at home though 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:30.980
 have the fine, straight hair that is like that 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.629
 more boring and without living in Hawaii or in 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.629
 california so let's go there 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's worth it right now I just washed 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.900
 hair with waves shampoo 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.629
 imperfect that is a shampoo that does not 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.939
 has silicones and what I have now is 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.549
 wet hair I dried it a bit with 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.250
 the dryer but not quite and I'm going to 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.210
 Apply the surfer waves spray little 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.690
 little by strands 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.100
 so then apply it well on everything 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.370
 by the tips you have to apply it from 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.900
 the root and this spray what it does is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.810
 provide texture the hair but also 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.360
 give it a lot of volume and make the wave 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.640
 welcome is the body as we end 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.950
 to leave the beach and if you have hair 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.570
 wavy or a little more mouldable what 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.490
 can do is throw them after the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.290
 try the surfer waves you get it out 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.600
 directly with a diffuser tonces in 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.750
 this better I already have the product thrown 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.950
 what I'm going to do is divide it into two and 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.989
 I'm going to twist it on itself 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.060
 and now these two strands that I have 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.870
 twisted I'm going to roll them up like this 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.300
 themselves and I subject it with a 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.709
 hairpin well so you see how it looks I'm going to 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.709
 continue with the rest of the hair 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.319
 you see that I am doing 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.920
 enough bows because I have my hair 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.569
 especially fine but most 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.849
 queries you will not have this problem 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.280
 simply to make three bows one 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.019
 here and another here and another click buns 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.299
 normal and dry them with the dryer 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.860
 you can get this effect but I do not 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.110
 I'm doing a little more work 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.800
 so that the waves remain longer 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.600
 checked 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.850
 and in this case I'm going to dry it with the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.410
 dryer because I have to finish 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.870
 record the video and to accelerate it a 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.110
 little but you can also let it dry 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.090
 then all day or if you want to go to 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.890
 sleep with this as long as you 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.220
 Place in a way that is comfortable for 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.220
 sleep 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.120
 the last step is to take some of the 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.200
 lacquer for surpassed waves so that you 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.660
 stay perfect and endure 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.430
 and well that's how the effect of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.470
 the surf huts I think is 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.360
 rather more as if I had thus the 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.920
 Natural hair that does not when I do it 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.390
 with the tongs that is also a 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.030
 effect that I like that is more polished 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.520
 but I do not know this for the summer I think 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.080
 as more natural and more fun to 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.110
 carry and above all is the fact of who 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.980
 It does not take heat and we can do it every 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.050
 day if we want and I leave you in the 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.050
 last images of what I recorded in the 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.540
 beach underwater my attempt at surfing 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.460
 because the truth is that in Barcelone 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.320
 There are waves but I really wanted to take 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.330
 a surfboard in this video because 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.070
 I think I wanted perfect and about 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.010
 I want to thank Juan Carlos 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.720
 that is my surfer friend who has done 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.580
 possible also this video and that has 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.380
 helped to record it I leave you with these 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.480
 images I hope you liked the 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.480
 tutorial and see you in the next video 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.670
 ah
