00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
in the part of the part with a textured

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.020 
in the part of the part with a textured
tiny<00:02:28.350> now<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> option<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.850> going

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
tiny now you do have the option of going

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
tiny now you do have the option of going
further<00:02:30.299> down<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.380> should<00:02:31.590> go<00:02:31.680> further

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
further down but it should go further

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.640 
further down but it should go further
down<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.609> has<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.150> material<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> back<00:02:33.989> so

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
down it has like material at the back so

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.130 
down it has like material at the back so
it<00:02:34.769> isn't<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.280> lace<00:02:35.549> however<00:02:36.239> if<00:02:36.359> you<00:02:36.540> want

it isn't just lace however if you want
to<00:02:37.200> extend<00:02:37.620> part<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.850> just

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
to extend part you can do that and just

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.880 
to extend part you can do that and just
add<00:02:39.209> concealer<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.079> will<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.380> longer<00:02:40.739> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
add concealer and it will be longer and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
add concealer and it will be longer and
what<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.150> full<00:02:42.420> lace<00:02:42.600> wig<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:43.079> a
