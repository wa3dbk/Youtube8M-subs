me with this question when you are
coding<00:00:13.349> lesions<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.309> they<00:00:14.549> give<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
coding lesions and they give you the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.570 
coding lesions and they give you the
diameter<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> code<00:00:16.500> based<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> first

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
diameter do you code based on the first

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.010 
diameter do you code based on the first
square<00:00:17.820> centimeter<00:00:18.300> or<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.779> multiply

oh<00:02:29.069> sorry<00:02:29.370> about<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.580> line<00:02:29.940> there<00:02:31.010> here's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
oh sorry about that line there here's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.330 
oh sorry about that line there here's
another<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.580> very<00:02:32.910> color<00:02:33.540> coded<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.340> just

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
another one very color coded I just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.270 
another one very color coded I just
repeated<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.730> question<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.250> off

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
repeated the question here so right off

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.210 
repeated the question here so right off
the<00:02:38.430> bat<00:02:38.580> by<00:02:39.150> looking<00:02:39.599> for<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> same<00:02:40.140> code<00:02:40.830> in

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
the bat by looking for the same code in

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.970 
the bat by looking for the same code in
the<00:02:42.120> different<00:02:42.480> answers<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.989> see<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.470> one<00:02:43.650> six

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the different answers I see one one six

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.780 
the different answers I see one one six
oh<00:02:44.129> six<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.879> answer<00:02:45.629> C<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.019> D<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.579> the<00:02:47.579> other

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
oh six in answer C and D and the other

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.420 
oh six in answer C and D and the other
codes<00:02:48.209> are<00:02:48.569> one<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
codes are one of a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.000 
codes are one of a
for<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.879> question<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:50.629> my<00:02:51.140> spidey-sense<00:02:51.530> says

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
for the question so my spidey-sense says

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610 
for the question so my spidey-sense says
it's<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.790> be<00:02:52.879> answer<00:02:53.239> C<00:02:53.599> or<00:02:53.840> D<00:02:53.900> without

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
it's going to be answer C or D without

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.740 
it's going to be answer C or D without
even<00:02:55.250> reading<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.610> question<00:02:56.000> which<00:02:56.720> probably

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
even reading the question which probably

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.539 
even reading the question which probably
a<00:02:57.110> lot<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.379> you<00:02:57.470> guys<00:02:57.620> were<00:02:57.860> picking<00:02:58.280> up<00:02:58.370> from

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
a lot of you guys were picking up from

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.330 
a lot of you guys were picking up from
the<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.760> previous<00:02:59.239> tip<00:02:59.720> here<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.799> just<00:03:01.220> to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
the the previous tip here and just to

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.190 
the the previous tip here and just to
confirm<00:03:01.849> I'm<00:03:02.329> gonna<00:03:02.840> look<00:03:03.049> at<00:03:03.260> 1:1<00:03:03.650> 606<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.790> I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
confirm I'm gonna look at 1:1 606 and I

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.809 
confirm I'm gonna look at 1:1 606 and I
copied<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.349> pasted<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.769> here<00:03:06.799> excision<00:03:07.670> of

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
copied and pasted it here excision of

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.990 
copied and pasted it here excision of
malignant<00:03:08.359> lesion<00:03:08.920> including<00:03:09.920> margins<00:03:10.459> trunk

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
malignant lesion including margins trunk

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.770 
malignant lesion including margins trunk
arms<00:03:11.329> or<00:03:11.780> legs<00:03:12.019> excise<00:03:12.709> diameter<00:03:13.370> over<00:03:13.780> 4.0

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
arms or legs excise diameter over 4.0

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.539 
arms or legs excise diameter over 4.0
centimeters<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.900> we<00:03:18.379> can<00:03:18.590> see<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.010> malignant

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
centimeters so we can see that malignant

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.830 
centimeters so we can see that malignant
matches<00:03:19.909> because<00:03:20.060> as<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.269> basal<00:03:20.659> cell

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
matches because as a basal cell

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.729 
matches because as a basal cell
carcinoma<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.340> was<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.359> legs

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
carcinoma and that it was of the legs

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.490 
carcinoma and that it was of the legs
left<00:03:24.739> thigh<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.220> was<00:03:25.370> excised<00:03:25.790> okay

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
left thigh that was excised okay

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.580 
left thigh that was excised okay
so<00:03:28.280> we've<00:03:28.579> got<00:03:28.819> that<00:03:29.060> now<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.780> question<00:03:30.500> was

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so we've got that now the question was

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.309 
so we've got that now the question was
specific<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.459> how<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.030> handle<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.690> square

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
specific to how to handle the the square

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.470 
specific to how to handle the the square
centimeters<00:03:33.889> and<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.099> so<00:03:34.519> what<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.060> did<00:03:35.180> was

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
centimeters and that so what I did was

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.539 
centimeters and that so what I did was
with<00:03:36.019> grafting<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:37.010> normally<00:03:37.400> have<00:03:37.459> to

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
with grafting you normally have to

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.879 
with grafting you normally have to
identify<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.060> recipient<00:03:38.659> site<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.170> the

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
identify the recipient site and the

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.550 
identify the recipient site and the
donor<00:03:40.129> site<00:03:40.519> if<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.269> an<00:03:41.420> autograft<00:03:41.989> meaning

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
donor site if it's an autograft meaning

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.740 
donor site if it's an autograft meaning
coming<00:03:42.889> from<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.370> patient<00:03:43.629> versus<00:03:44.629> an

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
coming from the patient versus an

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.809 
coming from the patient versus an
allograft<00:03:45.260> which<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.159> coming<00:03:46.459> from<00:03:46.579> like<00:03:46.760> a

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
allograft which is coming from like a

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.259 
allograft which is coming from like a
cadaver<00:03:47.299> or<00:03:47.629> a<00:03:48.260> live<00:03:49.220> donor<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:49.700> normally

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
cadaver or a live donor but normally

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.569 
cadaver or a live donor but normally
live<00:03:50.540> people<00:03:50.720> don't<00:03:50.930> donate<00:03:51.200> their<00:03:51.319> skin<00:03:51.579> so

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
live people don't donate their skin so

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.030 
live people don't donate their skin so
in<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.909> case<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.449> it's<00:03:53.660> an<00:03:54.379> auto<00:03:54.680> graft

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
in this case it's it's an auto graft

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.430 
in this case it's it's an auto graft
because<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.730> said<00:03:56.000> patient<00:03:56.989> had<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.169> lesion

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
because it said patient had the lesion

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.680 
because it said patient had the lesion
on<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.560> left<00:03:57.859> thigh<00:03:58.129> and<00:03:58.669> then<00:03:59.329> they

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
on the left thigh and then they

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.110 
on the left thigh and then they
harvested<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.590> graft<00:04:00.859> from<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.370> left<00:04:01.669> lower

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
harvested a graft from the left lower

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.839 
harvested a graft from the left lower
leg<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> left<00:04:03.889> lower<00:04:04.099> leg<00:04:04.310> was<00:04:04.519> helping

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
leg so the left lower leg was helping

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.890 
leg so the left lower leg was helping
out<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.090> left<00:04:05.329> thigh<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.419> left<00:04:08.659> thigh

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
out the left thigh so the left thigh

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.869 
out the left thigh so the left thigh
said<00:04:09.319> 4.3<00:04:10.310> times<00:04:10.790> -<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.690> multiply<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.280> okay<00:04:13.280> so

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
said 4.3 times - you multiply it okay so

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.789 
said 4.3 times - you multiply it okay so
that<00:04:14.060> becomes<00:04:14.359> an<00:04:14.510> eight<00:04:14.750> point<00:04:15.109> six<00:04:15.349> square

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
that becomes an eight point six square

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.560 
that becomes an eight point six square
centimeter<00:04:17.169> defect<00:04:18.169> area<00:04:18.650> okay<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:20.239> donor

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
centimeter defect area okay the donor

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.779 
centimeter defect area okay the donor
site<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.139> graph<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.650> left<00:04:21.829> lower<00:04:22.070> leg<00:04:22.340> was

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
site the graph the left lower leg was

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.850 
site the graph the left lower leg was
five<00:04:23.090> by<00:04:23.360> five<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.020> it's<00:04:24.139> twenty-five<00:04:24.650> square

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
five by five so it's twenty-five square

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.719 
five by five so it's twenty-five square
centimeters<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.919> case<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.430> talking

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
centimeters so in this case it's talking

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.700 
centimeters so in this case it's talking
about<00:04:31.570> excision<00:04:32.570> a<00:04:32.630> malignant<00:04:33.110> okay<00:04:33.440> over

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
about excision a malignant okay over

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.890 
about excision a malignant okay over
four<00:04:33.919> square<00:04:34.400> centimeters<00:04:34.880> then<00:04:35.389> we<00:04:35.539> have<00:04:35.750> to

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
four square centimeters then we have to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.430 
four square centimeters then we have to
do<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.169> math<00:04:36.490> for<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.610> one<00:04:37.789> five<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.659> two<00:04:38.900> o<00:04:38.930> +

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
do the math for the one five to two o +

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.939 
do the math for the one five to two o +
1<00:04:39.590> 5<00:04:39.800> -<00:04:40.070> 2<00:04:40.280> 1<00:04:40.490> -<00:04:40.789> 200<00:04:41.539> is<00:04:41.780> 20<00:04:41.810> square<00:04:42.199> centimeters

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
1 5 - 2 1 - 200 is 20 square centimeters

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.149 
1 5 - 2 1 - 200 is 20 square centimeters
or<00:04:43.159> less<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.849> then<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.020> add-on<00:04:45.500> code<00:04:45.889> is

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
or less and then the add-on code is

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.790 
or less and then the add-on code is
additional<00:04:47.090> 20<00:04:47.510> square<00:04:47.930> centimeters<00:04:48.560> and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
additional 20 square centimeters and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.370 
additional 20 square centimeters and
this<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.460> key<00:04:49.760> phrase<00:04:50.090> guys<00:04:50.449> or<00:04:50.750> part

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
this is a key phrase guys or part

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.570 
this is a key phrase guys or part
thereof<00:04:52.449> so<00:04:53.449> we<00:04:53.570> had<00:04:53.720> 25<00:04:54.500> square<00:04:54.979> centimeters

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
thereof so we had 25 square centimeters

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.760 
thereof so we had 25 square centimeters
so<00:04:55.849> we<00:04:56.000> need<00:04:56.240> 1<00:04:56.900> 5<00:04:57.139> 2<00:04:57.440> 200<00:04:57.940> for<00:04:58.940> 20<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.510> and

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
so we need 1 5 2 200 for 20 of it and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.140 
so we need 1 5 2 200 for 20 of it and
then<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.889> add-on<00:05:01.279> code<00:05:01.550> for<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.240> 5

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
then the add-on code for the 5

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.260 
then the add-on code for the 5
because<00:05:03.990> five<00:05:04.260> is<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.530> part<00:05:04.860> thereof<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.430> 20

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
because five is a part thereof of 20

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.560 
because five is a part thereof of 20
okay<00:05:07.260> so<00:05:07.979> hopefully<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.520> makes<00:05:08.550> sense<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.360> if

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
okay so hopefully that makes sense so if

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.830 
okay so hopefully that makes sense so if
you<00:05:09.780> voted<00:05:10.050> for<00:05:10.229> C<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.340> were<00:05:11.490> correct<00:05:11.940> okay

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
you voted for C you were correct okay

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.370 
you voted for C you were correct okay

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
and also if you happen to look up one

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.860 
and also if you happen to look up one
five<00:05:16.620> one<00:05:16.650> five<00:05:17.070> Oh<00:05:17.130> first<00:05:17.630> instead<00:05:18.630> of<00:05:18.690> the

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
five one five Oh first instead of the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.469 
five one five Oh first instead of the

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
150 to 200 you could have thrown that

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.270 
150 to 200 you could have thrown that
out<00:05:21.690> because<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.350> one<00:05:22.560> said<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.919> tissue

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
out because that one said a tissue
