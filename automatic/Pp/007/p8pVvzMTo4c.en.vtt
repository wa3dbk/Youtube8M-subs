00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.720
 with the objective of improving the performance and taking care of his father-in-law, we will show how 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.729
 proceed to measure the skid index of the tractor 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.009
 if the procedure were it will bring savings in soil preparation 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.009
 and increase the productivity of your crop 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.210
 it is good to remember the tire must skate slowly to lessen the effort of the axle 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.309
 make operation softer to prevent premature wear 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.900
 besides the cold front is to follow 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.370
 in fact the defined positions visited excessive skating in this case 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.860
 if you miss the less-fancied situation 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.350
 marcus clearly defined 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.780
 show that there are no matches incidentally action is that you decrease the total weight 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 support 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 that mark 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.160
 shows that traction and the skating index are correct 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.140
 in the center there are signs of skating 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.220
 our external forces the brands are suffering and happy in the manual of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.159
 operation and maintenance who accompanies the tractor you found the indexes 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.000
 according to the type of soil 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.750
 jabor 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.549
 nothing make a mark on the right-side one of the rear tires 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.290
 If the factor is drawn, make sure the transaction is coupled with 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.380
 the implement raised and in the area to be worked position the tractor and marquez 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.760
 not only move a tractor until the tire is complete and have the turns 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.500
 yea 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 3 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 fable trader neymar attacker not on the ground 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.580
 now the same route an element later proceed in the same way 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.659
 I'm counting the number of laps until I get the penalty mark 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.470
 if on the last lap the tire did not complete every spin I've been on 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.639
 course in the form of being bad 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:23.979
 our example the first generated 11 turns but 60% of the other turn what 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.979
 corresponds to the far comma six laps 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.039
 with these results in hand began to get full of nails 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.299
 the number of three points with the first suspense corresponds to 100% 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.720
 on Sunday October 11 six laps with the time worked 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.419
 or 1-1 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.930
 the three points with the implement suspended 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.509
 is equal to a comma six points 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.219
 this corresponds to 6% 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.599
 then the term 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.229
 same as listening to it six times without interest 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.219
 divided by 10 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.489
 so we see that there is equal to 16% 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.039
 this way considers the percentage of skating 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.819
 I am an example 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.869
 the percentage found was 12 6% 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.919
 vint cerf considered excessive for this type of task 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.019
 would be below 13% 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.309
 in this situation 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.959
 we suggest that the Lula government took place within the
