00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.620
 house that is your house today we are going to do 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.339
 these flowers and what beauty are 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.950
 incredible I hope you like them and not 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.550
 stop subscribing here here we have 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.760
 the mold download it in my blog there what 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.730
 you can find crepe paper that is this 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 paper that is like as very noisy and that 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.930
 It is still stretch out a little longer 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.480
 we use the colors that you want 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.980
 liquid silicone glue and let's go 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.780
 bags that we are going to decorate 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.289
 the first thing you're going to do 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 is to fold your paper so you can 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.929
 cut many little flowers from a pole 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.970
 then here we are going to fold it three 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.780
 times 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.660
 this in order to get you out 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.110
 well enough in a single pass of 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.110
 cut 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 now we are going to cut it with a lot 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 careful you know 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.159
 Scissors other than scissors 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:15.770
 the seam here I already had them cut 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.259
 and nothing else, I'm going to show you how 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.140
 let's join because that's the part 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.479
 Well that is more 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.180
 It's not complicated but you have to have 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.400
 a little more attention then first 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.030
 let's put in let's open our 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.030
 glue 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.880
 and let's put the white first 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.159
 how a sandwich exactly is how it uses 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.700
 very much the joke is that you put it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.890
 out of phase 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.080
 outdated means that they are not in 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.290
 slaps but they are like this 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.350
 and now let's put the other white and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.350
 finally we are going to put your center 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.670

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.009
