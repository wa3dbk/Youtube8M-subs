00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.910
 of which several variants 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.670
 down the rest in a view window 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:34.399
 works and I'm talking like that now 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.340
 you can also look in from behind 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.260
 Here comes the back to the fore 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 imagine 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.600
 At the side are the main ones 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.689
 controls the clock looks like a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 chronograph but that's the usa 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.729
 These two pushers serve here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.130
 Setting the date and this pressure 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.880
 down there serves to adjust the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.900
 Months is very clear you can change the clock 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.670
 manfred algerien also raises by hand 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 according to you can set the clock 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:40.530
 by now here according to the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:45.200
 pointer moved and I'll put it now 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.880
 as a date around by corresponding here 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 continue to press now I see the same 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.259
 times with the month shortage 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.630
 you can see the little pointer here moves 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.700
 also if you like the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.009
 you have to adjust something during the weekday 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.000
 act differently 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:11.970
 you take the watch so that one page here 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 a sturgeon of the small one can and can 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.190
 then continue to press accordingly 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.680
 I just did that now and with it 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.800
 It then recorded the clock and can 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.090
 be worn accordingly 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.300
 you can see the Chinese used 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.050
 caliber has a respectable 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.310
 building height 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.390
 This makes the clock very massive and of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.340
 design here 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.400
 that's a matter of taste 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.400
 I like medi clock quite well 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.360

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.360
 trowels clock
