you want to set somewhere for them to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080 
you want to set somewhere for them to
actually<00:00:40.530> spawn<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> want<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually spawn you know you want them to
if<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> sort<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
if you want them to be on a sort of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
if you want them to be on a sort of
linear<00:00:44.760> storyline<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.870> going

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
linear storyline you know you're going

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
linear storyline you know you're going
to<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.140> them<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> start<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.190> away<00:00:47.430> from

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to want them to start you know away from

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
to want them to start you know away from
the<00:00:48.000> action<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.660> maybe<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> they

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the action you know maybe here and they

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.350 
the action you know maybe here and they
have<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> run<00:00:50.100> over<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.059> we're<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
have to run over there so we're going to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
have to run over there so we're going to
be<00:00:51.449> able<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> compensate<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
be able to compensate for that and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
be able to compensate for that and
pretty<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.460> said<00:00:53.910> where<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> spawn

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pretty much said where we want to spawn

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
pretty much said where we want to spawn
so<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> moment<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> couple<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
so at the moment to just got a couple of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.790 
so at the moment to just got a couple of
things<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:57.960> completely<00:00:58.559> irrelevant

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
things these are completely irrelevant

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490 
things these are completely irrelevant
and<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.390> need<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> worry<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.050> them

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and you do not need to worry about them

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
and you do not need to worry about them
so<00:01:02.250> first<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.210> let's<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
so first of all let's just go over to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.320 
so first of all let's just go over to
our<00:01:03.989> entity<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> grab<00:01:05.339> myself<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.790> spawn<00:01:06.060> point

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
our entity and grab myself a spawn point

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
our entity and grab myself a spawn point
you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.960> find<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.500> multi-brand<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.250> can

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you can find that in multi-brand you can

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.219 
you can find that in multi-brand you can
just<00:01:08.490> place<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.760> wherever<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

just grab that in and drag it straight

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.340 
just grab that in and drag it straight

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
okay there we go so this is our spawn

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.899 
okay there we go so this is our spawn

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
point this little guy running location

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
point this little guy running location
and<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.110> press<00:01:22.290> ctrl<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> now

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and if we just press ctrl to you now

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
and if we just press ctrl to you now
you'll<00:01:23.520> notice<00:01:23.900> nothing's<00:01:24.900> happened<00:01:25.350> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you'll notice nothing's happened I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
you'll notice nothing's happened I
didn't<00:01:25.830> actually<00:01:25.920> spawn<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.729> I'm<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
didn't actually spawn there I'm just

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.219 
didn't actually spawn there I'm just
going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
going to go over here just to get a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.039 
going to go over here just to get a
better<00:01:28.409> view<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.880> see

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
better view of that and as you can see

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
better view of that and as you can see
absolutely<00:01:31.049> nothing<00:01:31.470> happened<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
absolutely nothing happened and it's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.210 
absolutely nothing happened and it's
completely<00:01:33.180> pointless<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.040> need<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
completely pointless so what we need to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
completely pointless so what we need to
do<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.240> into<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> flow<00:01:36.869> graph<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
do is we just go into the flow graph and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.730 
do is we just go into the flow graph and
actually<00:01:38.280> set<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:38.909> some<00:01:39.270> commands<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.320> tell<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
actually set up some commands to tell it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.910 
actually set up some commands to tell it
how<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> work<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.630> first<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
how to work so first of all to get a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.590 
how to work so first of all to get a
flow<00:01:44.130> graph<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.360> need<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
flow graph as you know we need a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
flow graph as you know we need a
container<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.220> let's<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.549> quickly

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
container for that so let's just quickly

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
container for that so let's just quickly
select<00:01:48.439> this<00:01:49.640> spawn<00:01:50.640> point<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.780> bloody

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
select this spawn point I can bloody

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980 
select this spawn point I can bloody

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
create flow graph you can name it

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
create flow graph you can name it
whatever<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.240> want<00:02:18.390> i'm<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.260> name

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

this<00:02:19.500> spawn<00:02:20.370> point<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.940> time<00:02:21.150> being<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
this spawn point to the time being and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.830 
this spawn point to the time being and
we<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.800> flow<00:02:23.490> graph<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.510> i'm<00:02:24.570> going<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
we now have flow graph so i'm going to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
we now have flow graph so i'm going to
quickly<00:02:24.900> expand<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:25.890> bit<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
quickly expand this a little bit and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.830 
quickly expand this a little bit and
some<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.210> probably<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.750> be

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
some of you probably going to be

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900 
some of you probably going to be
wondering<00:02:28.380> what<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:28.980> earth<00:02:29.280> am<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.520> gonna<00:02:29.670> do

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
wondering what on earth am I gonna do

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.570 
wondering what on earth am I gonna do
here<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.380> very<00:02:31.560> similar<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.100> kismet

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
here so it's very similar to kismet

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.370 
here so it's very similar to kismet
actually<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.120> if<00:02:33.210> you've<00:02:33.300> got<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:34.260> an

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
actually so if you've got a and like an

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.650 
actually so if you've got a and like an
entity<00:02:34.770> or<00:02:35.040> an<00:02:35.130> actor<00:02:35.460> selected<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.390> add

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
entity or an actor selected you can add

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.210 
entity or an actor selected you can add
it<00:02:36.810> straight<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.440> let's<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:37.740> ahead<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:37.980> do

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
it straight in so let's go ahead and do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.010 
it straight in so let's go ahead and do
that<00:02:38.250> let's<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.210> add<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:39.900> select

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
that let's go to add and then select

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.940 
that let's go to add and then select
identity<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.490> have<00:02:41.610> our<00:02:42.030> spawn<00:02:42.510> point

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
identity and now we have our spawn point

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.260 
identity and now we have our spawn point
keep<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.220> mind<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.880> do<00:02:45.120> have

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
keep this in mind that if you do have

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.570 
keep this in mind that if you do have
numerous<00:02:45.570> spawn<00:02:45.840> points<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.590> you

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
numerous spawn points you can see you

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.380 
numerous spawn points you can see you
know<00:02:47.700> they're<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.210> different

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
know they're going to have different

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
know they're going to have different
values<00:02:48.750> well<00:02:49.590> well<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> days<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:51.120> yeah<00:02:51.410> so

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
values well well I days but yeah so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.560 
values well well I days but yeah so
we've<00:02:52.770> got<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> spawn<00:02:53.220> point<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:53.970> so

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
we've got a spawn point in here now so

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.910 
we've got a spawn point in here now so
how<00:02:54.720> are<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:54.870> going<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.110> know<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> do<00:02:55.740> with

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
how are we going to know what to do with

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.590 
how are we going to know what to do with
that<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.120> got<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.300> few<00:02:57.480> different

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
that you can see we got a few different

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.470 
that you can see we got a few different
things<00:02:57.840> disable<00:02:58.740> enable<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.490> spawn<00:02:59.880> what's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
things disable enable and spawn what's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.790 
things disable enable and spawn what's
you<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:00.900> want<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.140> use<00:03:01.260> right<00:03:01.590> now<00:03:01.620> is

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
you really want to use right now is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.199 
you really want to use right now is
spawn<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:02.580> we'll<00:03:02.700> be<00:03:02.820> telling<00:03:03.060> our

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
spawn because we'll be telling our

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.030 
spawn because we'll be telling our
plates<00:03:03.480> spawn<00:03:04.080> there<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.740> probably

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
plates spawn there is you probably

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.060 
plates spawn there is you probably
guessed<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:06.060> let's<00:03:06.270> just<00:03:06.390> go<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.110> add<00:03:07.709> a

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
guessed so let's just go in and add a

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.910 
guessed so let's just go in and add a
new<00:03:08.310> start<00:03:08.730> node<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.209> start<00:03:09.720> node<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.260> different

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
new start node a start node is different

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.530 
new start node a start node is different
you<00:03:11.010> know<00:03:11.130> play<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.490> spoon<00:03:11.760> or<00:03:11.880> level<00:03:12.209> loaded

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
you know play a spoon or level loaded

editor in game so let's just go ahead

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.070 
editor in game so let's just go ahead
and<00:03:19.530> drag<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.130> output<00:03:20.640> over<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.060> spawn<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.660> it

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
and drag the output over to spawn and it

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.350 
and drag the output over to spawn and it
should<00:03:22.320> work<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.730> don't<00:03:24.000> really<00:03:24.090> need<00:03:24.239> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
should work now you don't really need to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.910 
should work now you don't really need to
worry<00:03:24.390> about<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.870> gaming<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.350> editor<00:03:25.709> at<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
worry about in gaming in editor at the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.009 
worry about in gaming in editor at the
moment<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.880> completely<00:03:27.300> ignore<00:03:27.660> lankan

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
moment just completely ignore lankan

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.600 
moment just completely ignore lankan
drag<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.620> side<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.130> you're<00:03:29.519> gonna

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
drag this to the side and you're gonna

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.570 
drag this to the side and you're gonna
see<00:03:29.910> if<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.450> go<00:03:30.660> over<00:03:30.690> here<00:03:31.140> press<00:03:31.769> ctrl<00:03:32.160> G<00:03:32.400> it's

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
see if I go over here press ctrl G it's

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.690 
see if I go over here press ctrl G it's
actually<00:03:32.970> move<00:03:33.209> me<00:03:33.390> off<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.720> spawn<00:03:33.989> point

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
actually move me off to the spawn point

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.800 
actually move me off to the spawn point
sometimes<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.910> may<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.180> work<00:03:36.239> straight<00:03:36.780> away

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
sometimes it may not work straight away

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.979 
sometimes it may not work straight away
so<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.769> may<00:03:38.070> want<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.370> generate<00:03:38.670> or<00:03:39.090> you

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
so you may want to just generate or you

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.530 
so you may want to just generate or you
may<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.170> want<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.590> generate<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.220> aai<00:03:42.000> just

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
may just want to generate all aai just

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.540 
may just want to generate all aai just
to<00:03:42.600> make<00:03:42.750> sure<00:03:42.780> what's<00:03:43.080> working<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.739> it

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
to make sure what's working and it

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.210 
to make sure what's working and it
should<00:03:44.880> work<00:03:45.090> perfectly<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.470> one<00:03:46.680> that's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
should work perfectly so one that's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.680 
should work perfectly so one that's
pretty<00:03:47.370> much<00:03:47.550> all<00:03:47.790> i<00:03:47.850> really<00:03:48.060> wanted<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.450> cover

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
i try to experiment around a whole bunch

i try to experiment around a whole bunch
of<00:03:51.780> different<00:03:52.050> things<00:03:52.260> such<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.970> know

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
forcing a I to spawn spawn points you

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.130

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
know going into vehicles this loads and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.390 
know going into vehicles this loads and
loads<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.590> actually<00:04:01.769> do<00:04:02.040> with<00:04:02.160> spawn

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
loads you can actually do with spawn

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.280 
loads you can actually do with spawn
