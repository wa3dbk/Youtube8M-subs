00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.790
 They took your friends or friends when they 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.650

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.239
 open the channel notify them and then a 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.370
 we were subscribing and see my videos 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.230
 and the whole truth is that they liked it a lot 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.550
 the idea and they supported me a lot and in fact 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 my best friend always tells me to see 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.410
 all my videos without caring what 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.390
 it never loses the painted blue álex 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.490
 lemus wants to know how my taste started 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.740
 for reading, because I believe that my eyes 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.240
 I was about 8 years old he did not give me the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.580
 book of the little prince and he told me that you 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 like to start reading and there 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.119
 started everything 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.580
 Alejandra Molina asks what was the 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.710
 first video uploading to youtube so 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 all the times honestly and this 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.630
 I never told you 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.610
 first video that went in 2010 and it was 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.320
 a video as a name of how I had 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.000
 gone on the day I did it for the best 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.740
 friend who did a lot and how we 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.050
 we could have been seeing every day 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.420
 not very often what I started doing was 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.190
 like a diary in videos of how was my 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.740
 day and how the week went and the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.570
 sent as in writings and the whole thing 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.250
 seriously but this video I left in 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.260
 private because it was nothing else for him and 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.670
 just as it took a lot to climb 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.140
 after starting to send the videos 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.140
 otherwise I will not keep climbing 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.790

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.920

 I woke up the foot to visit the bunny 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.580
 to see how the bunny was or was 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.800
