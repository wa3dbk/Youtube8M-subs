coming alone so let's take a look to the
material<00:00:28.539> we<00:00:28.660> need<00:00:35.640> 9<00:00:36.640> measures<00:00:36.880> of<00:00:37.240> one

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
material we need 9 measures of one

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.110 
material we need 9 measures of one
millimeter<00:00:37.810> cotton<00:00:38.410> West<00:00:38.650> or<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:39.670> can<00:00:39.850> choose

millimeter cotton West or you can choose

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.420 
millimeter cotton West or you can choose
to<00:00:40.330> make<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.780> using<00:00:41.440> another<00:00:41.530> type<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.010> cord

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
to make it using another type of cord

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.960 
to make it using another type of cord
anyway<00:00:42.820> as<00:00:43.170> rated<00:00:44.170> cord<00:00:44.500> raised<00:00:44.980> cotton<00:00:45.460> or

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
anyway as rated cord raised cotton or

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.290 
anyway as rated cord raised cotton or
later<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:50.500> also<00:00:50.650> need<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:50.980> square<00:00:51.460> coming<00:00:51.970> in

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
later we also need a square coming in

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:07.260 
later we also need a square coming in

all<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.830> cords<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.370> order<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.820> get<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> little

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
all the cords in order to get a little

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:38.980 
all the cords in order to get a little
loop<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.870> will<00:01:26.409> be<00:01:26.590> used<00:01:26.860> as<00:01:27.070> closure<00:01:27.460> later

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990

the<00:02:32.250> resume<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.180> Loom<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.540> coated<00:02:33.989> by

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
the resume as the Loom is coated by

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.830 
the resume as the Loom is coated by
numbers<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.040> letters<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.849> will<00:02:36.269> tell<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
numbers and letters I will tell you the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.900 
numbers and letters I will tell you the
position<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.620> change<00:02:37.890> by<00:02:38.310> letters<00:02:38.700> or<00:02:38.880> numbers

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
position to change by letters or numbers

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.130 
position to change by letters or numbers
so<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.410> cord<00:02:40.739> at<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.099> top<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> number<00:02:42.329> 6<00:02:42.660> -

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
so the cord at the top on the number 6 -

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.819 
so the cord at the top on the number 6 -
the<00:02:43.170> uppercase<00:02:44.130> G<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.540> move<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.140> number<00:02:46.470> 5

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
the uppercase G then move the number 5

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.949 
the uppercase G then move the number 5
to<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> lowercase<00:02:47.730> G<00:02:49.609> now<00:02:50.609> move<00:02:51.120> closer<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
to the lowercase G now move closer the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.580 
to the lowercase G now move closer the
cords<00:02:52.410> at<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.769> top<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.549> means<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.480> number<00:02:54.840> 7

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
cords at the top it means to number 7

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.960 
cords at the top it means to number 7
and<00:02:55.769> 4<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.780> 6<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.530> 5<00:02:58.739> respectively<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
and 4 to 6 and 5 respectively at the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.940 
and 4 to 6 and 5 respectively at the
bottom<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.049> repeat<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.440> same<00:03:01.620> step

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
bottom we have to repeat the same step

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.530 
bottom we have to repeat the same step
so<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> number<00:03:03.060> 15<00:03:03.569> -<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.019> lowercase<00:03:04.650> D<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
so the number 15 - the lowercase D and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.710 
so the number 15 - the lowercase D and
the<00:03:06.540> court<00:03:06.840> number<00:03:07.350> 16<00:03:08.220> -<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.609> uppercase<00:03:09.359> D

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the court number 16 - the uppercase D

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.460 
the court number 16 - the uppercase D
then<00:03:10.620> join<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.400> two<00:03:11.430> remaining<00:03:12.030> course

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
then join the two remaining course

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.160 
then join the two remaining course
putting<00:03:13.470> them<00:03:13.739> in<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> number<00:03:14.280> 15<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.150> 16<00:03:15.660> now

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
putting them in the number 15 and 16 now

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.680 
putting them in the number 15 and 16 now
follow<00:03:16.709> repeating<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.700> same<00:03:17.970> technique<00:03:18.420> in

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
follow repeating the same technique in

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.949 
follow repeating the same technique in
both<00:03:19.049> sides<00:03:19.380> uppercase<00:03:20.220> e<00:03:20.489> -<00:03:21.209> 14<00:03:21.959> F<00:03:22.350> 2<00:03:23.010> 4<00:03:23.959> then

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
both sides uppercase e - 14 F 2 4 then
