 hello welcome to we are from and my name 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.049
 is carla and in this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.900
 make such a very general analysis of 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.609
 how can you break down the perspective 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.730
 of a bicycle and then take it to 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.980
 a drawing here we have on a bicycle 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.620
 in side view another in perspective and 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.600
 we are going to analyze this same to take 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.169
 those important elements we are going to 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.329
 start by taking reference points 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.320
 that are going to be the top of the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.559
 rim the bottom and this the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.170
 center of the rims almost always 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.760
 when you have such a complicated element 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.739
 to draw in perspective is good 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.749
 find these points that do not change to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.639
 throughout the perspective if you have them 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.440
 Well, it's great, not because you already have a 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.839
 reference with which you can make a 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.729
 square that is much simpler let's go 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.219
 to get another one over here where I folded the 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.510
 handle where it becomes good where 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.140
 makes a double in this phase in that 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.740
 sense 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.220
 good already in perspective if you notice what 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.440
 The only thing that was done was to unite the most 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.479
 top of the bike with the most point 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.430
 high forgive the highest point of the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.830
 front rim with the highest point of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.890
 the rear rim the same in the part 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.880
 from below in the central part and thus by 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.580
 last one was done, let's say, to the scoring 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.320
 following the references of the escape 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.540
 down all these points of agreement that 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.100
 they go to an imaginary point that is very 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.670
 far away that is the vanishing point of the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.009
 left ok after what what's going 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.020
 to do is close that then that let's say 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.210
 the wheels in squares here we see it 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.780
 in perspective it's pretty simple 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.220
 simply because you do as squares 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.580
 that include your tires then 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.990
 we make another one here and we make another one here 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.330
 in perspective there is something like what 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.729
 you see below if the opacity dropped a little 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.679
 it looks clearly like those lines that 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.780
 we have two pictures in 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.229
 perspective if it is so it is 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.409
 pretty simple 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.200
 now what follows is to fill or draw 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.170
 the ellipses when you are going to make a drawing 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.110
 you without loading a photo 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 first you have to look for the bone axis the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.190
 another vanishing point that goes to the side 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080
 right but in this case as we were 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.819
 working backwards I 'm trying to 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.590
 search for references from a 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.560
 photograph then the first thing that was done 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.569
 It was filled tires to like giving 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.620
 an ellipse to fit perfectly in 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.510
 these tires 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.989
 if you look at those ellipses they have four 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.090
 like little pits that I'm going to give you here 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.610
 exemplify in another ellipse here has 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.640
 one up on the left below and the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.240
 right and that's always in the part 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.510
 higher and more 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.690
 let's say across and at the top of the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.090
 ellipse not then if here look like 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.070
 we lean the ellipse for those points 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.410
 they turned to the left that's a 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.180
 point let's say it's the most important thing of 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.890
 the elites do not like you know they have 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.590
 those four points and those have to 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.280
 fit in certain perspective that is the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.320
 that we're going to see here, look at the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.680
 two points that are across the site 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.750
 together or the unes give you this other leak 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.900
 that goes to the right side and then 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.420
 you're two of the back tire and 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.370
 they give you another line that goes towards the same 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 vanishing point remember that these two 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.420
 lines can never be parallel because 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.340
 if they were parallel because it was not a 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.830
 real perspective as we see it 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.300
 you always have to go together, look 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.420
 as the distance between them 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.130
 here is different here and it is becoming 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.700
 smaller as you move towards the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.710
 right side of the screen then 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.930
 well that is the first the first axis that 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.970
 gives us the ellipse and the second is the one 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.730
 unites the part 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.770
 what is this point with this point and if you 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.990
 fixed is very important and this rule 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.020
 the relationship is always fulfilled 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.880
 between these two lines is 90 degrees 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.090
 ok then if for some reason your voice 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.109
 Eto'o does not respect those 90 degrees as 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.850
 Something's wrong 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.920
 that means that your ellipse is crooked 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.290
 and the highest point of the ellipse what 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.290
 you drew in two at another point that did not 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.780
 it must be here now as the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.580
 process is then invested in 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.050
 reality when you draw you're going to 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.780
 draw it like this first you're going to draw 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.940
 the line that goes to the vanishing point 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.120
 on the right that you are going to invent 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.520
 another you're going to decide where you're going next 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.620
 to draw the 90 degree line that is 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.629
 the other axis and since you have those two 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:55.389
 axes look like the axis line and the 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:58.569
 the say the line that forms the picture 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.350
 are the ones that tell you where they are 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.600
 people 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.060
 for the ellipse that you drew in this 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.400
 case how my lines are very thick and 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.970
 I did not make them so precise right in the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.890
 let's say millimetrically precise then 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.660
 does not match one hundred percent but if 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.680
 enough to give you an idea 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.550
 what I'm talking about 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.760
 if you notice this 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.100
 these ellipses fit in those boxes in 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.380
 perspective and respect those little points of 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.110
 the 90 degrees and the lg that I am 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.380
 commenting 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.950
 but there may be a margin of a turn 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.600
 means there is mild but that's why in the 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.940
 thickness of the lines and then that the photo 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.330
 not really, I'm not taking it 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.770
 as a reference to one hundred percent not 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.310
 then let's say if you already have up to here 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.230
 draw the tires almost already almost 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.780
 you did it and the only thing that you would miss 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.090
 it would be like continuing to map this drawing 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.220
 for example if you from the center have a 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.380
 vertical line and you do also here in 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.680
 the perspective because you realize that 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.380
 this axis of the bicycle let's say 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.690
 Where does the handlebar come from? 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.280
 inclination on that vertical line no 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.570
 you can do the handlebar here to this 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.610
 height because it would be 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.260
 disproportionate not then here 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.630
 you would also have to tilt and 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.030
 you have that axis later in the part of 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.010
 back you can start from the center of the 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.010
 later tire here I'm going to 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.250
 approach and you notice how there is here 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.540
 then a distance between the rim 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.370
 forgiveness between the seat and your line 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.200
 vertical that in this case something 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.490
 important to consider 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.620
 is that we are working in three 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.419
 dimensions no no 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.370
 you have to also consider that the 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.370
 seat seen from above because it has 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.680
 as a part if here output and then it's 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.350
 for here and then something like that not then 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.060
 this volume is going to hinder you say 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.130
 to see the line in the back 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.130
 actually here this I do not know is not 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.229
 I should see but still respecting 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.360
 that that distance and so on 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.639
 you have to find what are the 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.710
 key lines so you can do as 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.180
 a map of the bicycle in perspective and 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.160
 since you do not have a drawing 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.610
 very ugly of pure stripes but that what 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.080
 you can use to trace and from there you can 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.910
 draw on it a sketch of a 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.139
 bicycle and so you do not have to be 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.699
 repeating over and over again the 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.430
 perspective you can use that scheme 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:20.789
 always trace it and on that draw 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.789
 as different variations not then 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.930
 I hope that I have served you 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.000
 analyze the bicycle in this way 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.949
 It may look like a vehicle 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.870
 complicated to draw but I think that 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:33.060
 if it breaks it down if it is first like a 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.770
 general scheme of perspective and 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.240
 then you worry about filling it with 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.970
 your design, they greatly simplify the 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.100
 process then that's all I hope 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.180
 that serves them and we 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.180
 in the next tutorial
