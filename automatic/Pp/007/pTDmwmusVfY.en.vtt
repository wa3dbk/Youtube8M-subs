 With the wisdom dss that was advocated by a company called gbi audio system 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:09.250
 We have a say technology is to create a hate using the hdss 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.760
 It is a company independent of tbi audio system. What is hdss ? 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.620
 More 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:21.380
 If a special material called heel material is inside the housing 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:25.520
 Then keep the non-housing in the housing constant by putting on the defecation of the housing 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.210
 It is to assist the correct movement of the diaphragm

 Long time without tiring to sound in the sand to the mayor of the Big 3, rather than a natural part of comfortable 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.329

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.220
 It came out 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.220
 This is the true cherry blossom 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.810
 This is amazing 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.530

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.080
 a 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:19.939
 It is an earpiece that is famous in this industry 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:23.180
 It is such a feeling when it sees near and the model number is a model number of 500 of t 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.819
 Because it is a low rebound ear tip 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.469
 Crush and will collapse like this 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:35.639
 When I smash it in this state and push it into the hole of my ear 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:38.640
 It swells like this and has high sound insulation then 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:42.920
 It also leads to the prevention of sound leakage 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:47.630

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:24.120
 I Well then sleepy chip I'd made of Beuve 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:28.290
 Feeling there is a great sense of luxury 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:33.540
 I would like to introduce the specifications of this earphone here 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.900

 There are color variations of this earphone total 3 colors in 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:17.560

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:48.030
 It feels like this when you remove the earpiece 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.710
 The lr madness is written small in the part of the foster of the work of the housing 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.460
 It is a branch of the cable 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.460
 It is like this 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.750
 The plug is the plug as you see 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:05.880
 Depending on the possibly when the equipment so we become a plug of a child who is 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.990
 It may be that parts do not interfere and stab 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.580
