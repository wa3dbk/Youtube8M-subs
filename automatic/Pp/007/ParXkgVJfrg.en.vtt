00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.209 
in 6.5 horsepower time an old style
there's<00:00:34.070> a<00:00:34.239> muffler<00:00:35.770> air<00:00:36.770> filter<00:00:37.989> gasps<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.440> had

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
there's a muffler air filter gasps I had

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.310 
there's a muffler air filter gasps I had
a<00:00:40.250> big<00:00:40.550> put<00:00:40.910> up<00:00:41.059> a<00:00:41.949> big<00:00:42.949> return<00:00:43.129> spring<00:00:44.199> cuz<00:00:45.199> it

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
a big put up a big return spring cuz it

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.569 
a big put up a big return spring cuz it
just<00:00:45.469> would<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.649> returned<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:49.640> then<00:00:50.140> yeah

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
just would have returned and then yeah

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.459 
just would have returned and then yeah
so<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.000> return<00:00:53.300> spring<00:00:53.449> goes<00:00:53.780> from<00:00:54.019> here<00:00:55.239> now

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
so the return spring goes from here now

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.229 
so the return spring goes from here now
it's<00:00:57.469> hard<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.800> pull<00:00:58.039> forward<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.090> comes

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
it's hard to pull forward then it comes

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's hard to pull forward then it comes
back<00:00:59.359> fully<00:01:00.429> there<00:01:01.429> yeah<00:01:01.699> there's<00:01:02.120> my<00:01:02.269> thrall

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.700 

so<00:01:05.930> you're<00:01:06.140> estrella<00:01:07.600> um<00:01:08.600> even<00:01:09.049> when<00:01:09.200> it's<00:01:09.320> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
so you're estrella um even when it's the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.230 
so you're estrella um even when it's the
engines<00:01:09.830> warm<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:11.450> still<00:01:11.930> each<00:01:12.170> choke<00:01:16.240> it's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
engines warm it's still each choke it's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.480 
engines warm it's still each choke it's
kind<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.479> annoying<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.380> don't<00:01:18.829> care<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.920> a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
kind of annoying but I don't care and a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:48.310 
kind of annoying but I don't care and a
few<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.759> others<00:01:23.060> work

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.550 

that<00:01:48.890> was<00:01:49.040> only<00:01:49.400> on

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
that was only on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:11.880 

three-quarters<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> full<00:01:53.460> throttle

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:03:28.520 

akhil<00:02:12.640> vows<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.210> what's<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.170> trade-off

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.570 

so<00:03:29.530> um<00:03:30.240> there<00:03:31.240> is<00:03:31.330> no<00:03:31.480> governor<00:03:31.990> removed

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
so um there is no governor removed

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.980 
so um there is no governor removed
that's<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.670> little<00:03:33.880> too<00:03:33.970> risky<00:03:34.330> for<00:03:34.360> me<00:03:34.600> because

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
that's a little too risky for me because

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.740 
that's a little too risky for me because
I'm<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.110> beginner<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.680> terms<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:35.980> go<00:03:36.100> karting<00:03:36.750> so
