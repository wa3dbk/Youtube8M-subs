00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.549
 but here with júlia lopes to speak one 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.549
 little about fifa 15 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.660
 He tells people who have to 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.969
 Novelty pricing now has a lot 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.570
 news from this year's game that is fifa 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.270
 15 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.590
 so one of my favorites is all 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.200
 all the work we've done in 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.660
 visual and authenticity are now the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.149
 players will have facial expressions to 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 demonstrate all the emotion and intensity 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.320
 what is happening and we know 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.239
 that football is a sport that has everything 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.280
 this drama then for the first time we 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.020
 we went to the professional players of the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.420
 greatest athletes in the world and captured 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.760
 your tastes not only in the neutral pose but 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.680
 also with their grimaces when they 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.480
 goal when they are angry with 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.490
 partner of the opponent taking a 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.560
 when they are so frustrated 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.890
 lost a goal and more I do not think 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.990
 This is if this revolution of visual and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.110
 authenticity that is only possible in 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.120
 new xbox platforms manny playstation 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.860
 4 is that it is one of the great differentials 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.689
 of this game but there are many others that 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.970
 could quote and now technician daniel 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.610
 by solid location coordinator 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.890
 da ei is daniel we've had several 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.830
 changes in location versus management 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.350
 that changed in this fifa 15 something that I 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.720
 I think that's what most users asked for. 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.220
 what we did is more goal myth than 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.810
 thiago staff was very complaining that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.909
 after two or three matches the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.110
 repetitive scoring goal scoring for 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.370
 To solve this, we recorded without 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.320
 new variations 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.720
 We have both generics that can 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.430
 to enter with any type of goal is goal 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.619
 specific as a bike one goal 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.360
 goal of a goldfish coverage goal and 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.710
 also for some players it is clear that 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.990
 you can not record all but a few 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.150
 players the best of goal shouts 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.130
 for them and I also saw that 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.020
 You are told a lot about the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.700
 artificial intelligence of goalkeepers, right? 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.400
 account for us how it will be this 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.290
 in fact we rewrote the new 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.990
 intelligence system of our 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.369
 goalies from zero for this match is with 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.290
 work that took two years to be 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.580
 done like many of these 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.619
 great improvements 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.479
 We have to work two years in the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.310
 position and only in the time of 91 years the goalkeeper 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.170
 was one of them and I 'm sure 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 everybody get the control will feel 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.000
 a much more agile goalkeeper 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.470
 to react to the change of trajectory in the ball 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.299
 so if the ball took a detour in the middle 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.769
 of the way before the goalkeeper had already 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.760
 committed to jumping in a direction not 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.069
 could for example 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.200
 stretch your hand or use your feet and legs 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.390
 to make this defense and now the goalkeeper 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.489
 and also opens up new ways of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.620
 make goals because the goalkeeper's body 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.019
 goalkeeper is obeying the same laws 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.489
 physics of physical simulation so 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.689
 perfect then correct that we already 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.689
 has in all players 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.989
 and how is the player's drive 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.629
 now when it changes the trajectory as 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.670
 is that this influences the game is not 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.849
 staying here we also work a lot 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.500
 in this area of ​​agility and capacity of the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.939
 player to change direction we 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.719
 really felt that even the game of the year 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.430
 past 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.510
 many of these plays the player tries 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.189
 change direction very quickly 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.019
 end up not appearing very real 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.969
 It took me a long time to give 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.799
 which were not very very believable 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.180
 very similar to reality and people 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.920
 invested heavily in these animations 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.139
 player capable of taking shorter steps 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.599
 to be able to make the change of 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.730
 direction and this impacts on 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.680
 invade several cases eg 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.689
 We have not played games until last year. 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.879
 player also got tired more had 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.919
 plus the loss of resistance're 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.450
 making a very very long movement 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.639
 very strong to change direction and 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.859
 now more cut is possible 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.450
 that it maintains more of its energy and 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.049
 change direction the way the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.049
 player who is 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.110
 and for players the old versions 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.110
 have changes should also be a challenge 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.970
 too big because for Brazil maybe 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.970
 be the market where it is still very 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.130
 important the ps3 xbox 360 and wii comes a 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.870
 challenge of offering new things to 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.580
 these players also involve a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.170
 very large negotiation work that 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.090
 an additional effort has been made in Canada to 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.380
 programming but we are happy that the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.700
 people could include part of the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.680
 content that other languages 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.420
 located will go down only 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.060
 promise who we can include 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.640
 in the present generation also for those who 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.290
 plays ps3 xbox 360 you can rest easy 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.890
 that will have enough news in the audio 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.890
 located also 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.489
 And we know you had a problem with 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.259
 cbf is that players can expect from 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.659
 not 15 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.490
 It's actually to make it clear. 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.770
 our program is neither with the confederation 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.830
 Brazilian football team that happened was 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.099
 which is we is the right to use the image 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.539
 of players who work in Brazil is that 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.699
 we had this right until the year 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.379
 past and changes in the way 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.319
 these rights are marketed 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.400
 we do not feel more certain of 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.319
 that we have this right for this 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.029
 and electronic arts when you do not have 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.090
 certainties have the right to use image 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.469
 of any kind we do not use and 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.180
 we run behind to know what you need 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.009
 to do is how do we do to 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.620
 reverse this situation and we did not find 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.389
 in Brazil an entity that responds by 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.430
 that with whom we can negotiate 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.740
 also no case for example how 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.990
 much talked about on the internet that there 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.849
 want to pay for this right is not 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.199
 interested in investing in this 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.569
 want to pay and practically do not know to 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.759
 who pays because it is not like in the leagues of 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.870
 where there is an exposure to 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.189
 federation of the urban area of 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.360
 professionals with whom 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.909
 directly why the players 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.439
 Brazilians working in Europe are in the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.729
 fifa 15 the same as always 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.029
 There were more who work in Brazil. 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.029
 not 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.160
 the release date is confirmed and 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.510
 what platforms will you have 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.730
 perfectly good 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.190
 fifa 15 with all the functionalities 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.680
 that we are announcing here today in 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.230
 new organ and will only be 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.230
 available for playstation 4 xbox year 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.210
 ipc from October 9 in Brazil 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.970
 but we also have the xbox version 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.340
 360 and playstation 3 coming out on the same date 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.780
 In the country with lots of new things. 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.310
 that I presented here is going to be 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.350
 now everything is not used 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.700
 possible because the new generations and the 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.630
 new generation really has much more 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.890
 processing power 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.080
 but I'm sure it was difficult 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.260
 on whatever platform it is going 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:16.210
 give happy and will play the best and more 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.210
 realistic football market games
