you're having trouble finding the solid

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.269 
you're having trouble finding the solid
area<00:00:19.080> straight<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.859> use<00:00:19.980> your<00:00:20.130> gun

anywhere your bullets hit is usually
safe<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.500> walk<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.160> beginning<00:00:23.519> area

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
safe to walk on in this beginning area

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939 
safe to walk on in this beginning area
once<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> get<00:00:24.689> across<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.500> rocks<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
once you get across use these rocks to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.130 
once you get across use these rocks to
line<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.430> where<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.359> try<00:00:27.720> not<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.109> too

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
line up where to go try not to go too

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.259 
line up where to go try not to go too
far<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> left<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> will

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
far to the left or the right or you will

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.749 
far to the left or the right or you will
fall<00:00:30.599> off<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.529> hold<00:00:31.859> forward<00:00:32.130> until<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> hit

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
fall off but hold forward until you hit

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
fall off but hold forward until you hit
an<00:00:32.969> invisible<00:00:33.210> wall<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.680> gets<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
an invisible wall and then it gets a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
an invisible wall and then it gets a
little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.880> tricky<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.239> you're<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
little bit tricky here you're going to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110 
little bit tricky here you're going to
hold<00:00:37.380> forward<00:00:37.680> into<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> wall<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.760> jump

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
hold forward into the wall and then jump

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
hold forward into the wall and then jump
repeatedly<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> very

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
repeatedly you will need to very

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
repeatedly you will need to very
slightly<00:00:41.370> move<00:00:41.910> side<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> side<00:00:42.510> until<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
slightly move side to side until you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.310 
slightly move side to side until you
find<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> actual<00:00:43.829> area<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.539> once<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
find the actual area and then once you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990 
find the actual area and then once you
hit<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.770> area<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.460> jump<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
hit the right area you will jump and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
hit the right area you will jump and
then<00:00:48.180> land<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.780> mid<00:00:49.230> jump<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.250> will

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
then land in mid jump and then you will

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
then land in mid jump and then you will
be<00:00:50.610> able<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.910> keep<00:00:51.329> jumping<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> continue

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
be able to keep jumping to continue

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.200 
be able to keep jumping to continue
climbing<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:53.789> bit<00:00:53.879> tricky

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
climbing it can be a little bit tricky

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
climbing it can be a little bit tricky
finding<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.750> actual<00:00:54.899> area<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
finding the actual area to get this to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.830 
finding the actual area to get this to
work<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.850> you'll<00:00:57.030> need<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.329> mess<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
work so you'll need to mess with it a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
work so you'll need to mess with it a
little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.109> until<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> hang<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
little bit until you get the hang of it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.250 
little bit until you get the hang of it
and<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.000> once<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> figure<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.109> can

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and then once you figure it out you can

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.979 
and then once you figure it out you can
do<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.440> fairly<00:01:01.829> consistently<00:01:02.370> once<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.510> climb

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
do it fairly consistently once you climb

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
do it fairly consistently once you climb
all<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> full<00:01:06.210> jump

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
all the way up you will do a full jump

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
all the way up you will do a full jump
where<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> land<00:01:07.110> normally<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> are

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
where you land normally and then you are

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.800 
where you land normally and then you are
at<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> top<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> barrier<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.510> hold

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
at the top of the barrier you can hold

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.230 
at the top of the barrier you can hold
forward<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.380> move<00:01:11.070> around<00:01:11.220> freely<00:01:11.640> your

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
forward and move around freely your

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
going to turn to your right and run

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
going to turn to your right and run
towards<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.729> wall<00:01:15.030> once<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.840> near<00:01:16.200> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
towards this wall once you get near it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.830 
towards this wall once you get near it
turn<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.549> again<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> you're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
turn to your right again and you're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620

going to aim towards this rock if you're

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
going to aim towards this rock if you're
lined<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.110> correctly<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.950> will<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.369> able<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
lined up correctly you will be able to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
lined up correctly you will be able to
make<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.030> problem<00:01:24.420> by<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.570> sprinting<00:01:25.259> but

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
make it no problem by just sprinting but

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
if you're worried about you can jump at

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
if you're worried about you can jump at
the<00:01:27.090> end<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> once<00:01:27.930> you've<00:01:28.110> land<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:29.009> here
