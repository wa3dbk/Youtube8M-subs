00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.570
 the basic figure with which we 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.820
 we move are the sixteenths 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.770
 for those who do not manage resources 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.040
 musical that is a sixteenths is a 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.380
 subdivision of 4 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.840
 in a pulse on a beat then yes I 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.840
 I have a set time 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:27.500
 the semi- cut would be nothing is nothing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.500
 da da da da da da da da 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.010
 about that pulse then we go 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.190
 to work on some clues because 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.410
 The real secret is to line up with 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.739
 the rest of the band we are going to work 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 with a bass track and drums that is 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.390
 only on a seventh sun chord 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.150
 we are going to work all this first stretch 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:06.670
 over the seventh sun sol chord 9 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.670
 on fret 10 or it would be 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.680
 of 22 on the separate string of 21 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.140
 in the fret 9 fourth string 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.760
 finger 3 on the third string on the fret 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.830
 10 little finger on the 10th fret of the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.220
 second string and sometimes we will spend 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.810
 the little finger to the first string too 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.620
 to be able to touch the king of the first 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.620
 rope then we can 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.740
 we will not work it indistinctly 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.550
 can can play the functional chord 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.140
 in both ways 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.140
 then let aa 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.630
 see how to initially work the hand 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 right as you press with your right hand 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.710
 We usually work when we are playing 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.400
 or rhythmic on fifths or alone with the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.490
 hand resting on the bridge to win 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.710
 a little bit of control or a little 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.229
 precision 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.479
 that regulate a little the movement in 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.690
 the amplitude of the movement in this case 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.209
 that does not work is freehand we are going to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.950
 see if we see people like nail 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.040
 rogers 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.700
 emblematic funk guitar we see that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.319
 he even works with the arm relaxed in 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.620
 the raised arm looks like it 's a 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.620
 pulsation 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.680
 made by someone who does not know how to touch but 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.650
 Actually what we are 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.510
 needing is to release the body as 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.150
 so that the body responds rhythmically 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.010
 rhythm is not a mechanism that we 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.360
 we learn by saying good up 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.829
 down up up down and what 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.680
 we can control we have to drop and 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.560
 it's almost like dancing then we're going to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.810
 try to synchronize our 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.549
 sixteenths on the track in two 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.810
 different speeds we will work 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.050
 that funk track in 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.800
 with only one seventh sun in 90 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.050
 hits per minute the 90th pulse times sounds 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.599
 90 times per minute and a little more 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.920
 fast at 100 hits per minute with the 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.280
 90 beats per minute 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280
 it sounds like this 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.400
 we adjust the pulse first 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.299
 now about that we try to put four 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.299
 notes 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.540
 Y 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.750
 two 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.610
 do not feel that we are losing the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.150
 time if we stayed a long 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.490
 while playing semicorcheas on top of that 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.680
 chord because actually every time what 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.980
 we can debug what we can debug more 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.409
 there is no perfect coordination 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.199
 then the fact of thinking about that 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.449
 we have to play sixteenth notes and do it 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.950
 to internalize until you feel what 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.190
 is 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.660
 and almost breathe in sixteenths is a 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.970
 work that we have to do now 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.650
 let's see how it sounds with the track in 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.650
 100 bits per minute 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.280
 our pulse we have to synchronize 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.530
 with the main blows together 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 our battery the kick drum and the box the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.800
 drums 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.940
 we look for improvements 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.560
 It is a secret when we are 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.020
 recording in studio the fact of 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.900
 either with a track or with a metronome 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.850
 the fact of not having to listen very 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.889
 strong the metronome or listen very 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.590
 strong the track but the opposite the 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:35.700
 idea is that when I'm playing from 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.590
 correct way correctly my 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.500
 accent hides or lid 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.020
 I hype the battery case when I 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.570
 I start to hear clearly the box 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.780
 the battery means that it is out of phase 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.000
 of my stroke then if I am touching 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.790
 by way of 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.890
 synchronized with him with the rhythm 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.830
 there is a tendency not to listen 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.310
 determined certain hits when 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.650
 I'm not listening to it clearly 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.450
 again it means that my guitar 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.890
 is doing here and the hype is 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.680
 falling a little bit before a little 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.340
 then in that in that synchrony between 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.340
 the sounds
