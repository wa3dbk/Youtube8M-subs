00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
motivation and I want to make a video

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.349 
motivation and I want to make a video
about<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.950> today<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.090> made<00:01:27.240> an

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
about this today because they made an

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.580 
about this today because they made an
error<00:01:27.569> and<00:01:27.749> they<00:01:27.840> couldn't<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
error and they couldn't get it out to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.809 
error and they couldn't get it out to
everybody<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.249> was<00:01:29.369> such<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> large

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
everybody because it was such a large

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.639 
everybody because it was such a large
gift<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.210> guess<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> look<00:01:31.289> into<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
gift I guess so they had to look into it

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:32.989 
gift I guess so they had to look into it
further<00:01:31.859> investigate<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.640> whatever

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
further investigate you know whatever

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.849 
further investigate you know whatever
and<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.689> they've<00:01:33.990> decided<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> they're

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
and now they've decided that they're

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.639

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
Legion seven-day le said we might even

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.900 
Legion seven-day le said we might even
saying

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
saying

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.070 
saying
just<00:02:20.090> doubled<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:20.510> everything<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.900> don't<00:02:21.020> know

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
just doubled for everything I don't know

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.270 
just doubled for everything I don't know
why<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.440> keep<00:02:21.470> listing<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> but

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
why I have to keep listing it but

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.860 
why I have to keep listing it but
basically<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.240> get<00:02:23.330> double<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.660> everything

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
basically you get double of everything

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.870 
basically you get double of everything
and<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.470> will<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.710> be<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.890> huge<00:02:25.220> GP<00:02:25.610> spike

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
and this will just be a huge GP spike

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.360 
and this will just be a huge GP spike
for<00:02:26.180> me<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.540> my<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.440> virtual<00:02:27.890> economy<00:02:28.280> on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
this game that often it's in my opinion

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.230

worth<00:02:36.980> getting<00:02:37.220> on<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.460> just<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.820> day<00:02:38.060> or

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
worth getting on on just that day or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.700 
worth getting on on just that day or
just<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.570> between<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.990> day<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.230> get<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
just in between that day to get the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.380 
just in between that day to get the
rewards<00:02:40.070> because<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.430> pretty<00:02:40.670> significant

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
rewards because it's pretty significant

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.180 
rewards because it's pretty significant
incoming<00:02:41.870> arms<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:42.560> know<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.680> feel<00:02:43.040> like

incoming arms I don't know I feel like

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.260 
incoming arms I don't know I feel like
they've<00:02:43.310> been<00:02:43.370> giving<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.760> lot<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.060> at<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
they've been giving it a lot but at the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.730 
they've been giving it a lot but at the
same<00:02:44.450> time<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.440> those<00:02:45.590> things
