data core and really doubt it is the
right<00:00:55.110> way<00:00:56.120> absolutely<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.240> it<00:00:57.390> looks<00:00:57.540> like

makes it very difficult for the endings

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789 
makes it very difficult for the endings

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
definitely really struggling here to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.490 
definitely really struggling here to
study<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.970> couple<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.330> skulks<00:03:08.810> pointing

see what the mixed team can do here
against<00:03:14.660> archaea<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.400> think<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:16.910> is

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
against archaea but I think this is

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.610 
against archaea but I think this is
definitely<00:03:17.150> going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.660> drawdown<00:03:18.080> zero

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
definitely going to be a drawdown zero

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.210 
definitely going to be a drawdown zero
down<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.550> sub<00:03:19.970> access<00:03:20.360> we've<00:03:20.540> got<00:03:20.720> two

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
down and sub access we've got two

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.670 
down and sub access we've got two
Marines<00:03:22.220> coming<00:03:22.520> from<00:03:22.760> both<00:03:23.030> sides<00:03:23.680> putting

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
Marines coming from both sides putting

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
Marines coming from both sides putting
the<00:03:24.770> pressure<00:03:24.980> on<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:25.460> RT<00:03:26.090> which<00:03:26.300> is<00:03:26.480> finally

ikea was definitely going for a lack of

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.570

arms lap in all those games that they
were<00:04:52.729> winning<00:04:52.939> all<00:04:53.509> those<00:04:53.689> games<00:04:53.990> too<00:04:54.169> but

were winning all those games too but

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.800 
were winning all those games too but
this<00:04:54.379> game<00:04:54.560> they<00:04:54.680> have<00:04:54.800> chosen<00:04:55.039> arms<00:04:55.340> up<00:04:55.460> I

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
this game they have chosen arms up I

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.059 
this game they have chosen arms up I
anticipate<00:04:56.810> although<00:04:57.259> I<00:04:57.289> can't<00:04:57.560> be<00:04:57.680> sure<00:04:57.710> the

anticipate although I can't be sure the

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.950 
anticipate although I can't be sure the
reason<00:04:58.250> they're<00:04:58.610> doing<00:04:58.939> that<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.389> they<00:04:59.599> just

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
reason they're doing that is they just

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.420 
reason they're doing that is they just
want<00:05:00.379> to<00:05:00.469> be<00:05:00.530> able<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.710> put<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:00.919> their<00:05:01.039> boards

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
because an alien come back here would be

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.999 
because an alien come back here would be
very<00:05:07.550> very<00:05:07.699> difficult<00:05:08.349> yeah<00:05:09.349> it's<00:05:09.710> all<00:05:09.830> about

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
very very difficult yeah it's all about

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.649 
very very difficult yeah it's all about
timing<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.610> longer<00:05:10.909> the<00:05:11.000> aliens<00:05:11.419> have<00:05:11.629> a

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
timing the longer the aliens have a

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.749 
timing the longer the aliens have a
closer<00:05:12.050> they<00:05:12.229> get<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.409> getting<00:05:12.740> a<00:05:12.800> pay<00:05:13.009> get<00:05:13.639> the

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
closer they get to getting a pay get the

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.010 
closer they get to getting a pay get the
fan<00:05:13.940> on<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.120> field<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.509> doesn't<00:05:14.690> matter<00:05:14.840> how

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
fan on the field it doesn't matter how

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.249 
fan on the field it doesn't matter how
good<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.500> are<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:16.190> will<00:05:16.490> be<00:05:17.360> dominated<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.229> a

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
good you are you will be dominated to a

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.200 
good you are you will be dominated to a
point<00:05:18.620> now<00:05:19.159> a<00:05:19.190> team<00:05:19.580> like<00:05:19.699> archaic<00:05:20.060> could

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
point now a team like archaic could

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.909 
point now a team like archaic could
probably<00:05:20.360> counter<00:05:20.780> that<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:20.960> little<00:05:21.229> bit<00:05:21.349> but

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
probably counter that a little bit but

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.350 
probably counter that a little bit but
it's<00:05:22.340> better<00:05:22.520> not<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.789> even<00:05:23.029> get<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.270> that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
it's better not to even get to that

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.969 
it's better not to even get to that
point<00:05:23.569> okay<00:05:23.870> it's<00:05:24.319> definitely<00:05:24.500> going<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.830> take

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
point okay it's definitely going to take

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.469 
point okay it's definitely going to take
a<00:05:25.009> long<00:05:25.250> time<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.639> get<00:05:25.849> in<00:05:25.969> that<00:05:26.000> fade<00:05:26.300> and

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
a long time to get in that fade and

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.779 
a long time to get in that fade and
definitely<00:05:27.349> say<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.590> if<00:05:27.830> it's<00:05:28.129> no<00:05:28.310> longer<00:05:28.610> a

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
definitely say that if it's no longer a

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.999 
definitely say that if it's no longer a
fade<00:05:29.479> insta<00:05:29.930> domination<00:05:30.409> but<00:05:30.500> what<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.770> Fate

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
fade insta domination but what the Fate

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.800 
fade insta domination but what the Fate
does<00:05:31.370> do<00:05:31.639> when<00:05:31.879> the<00:05:32.000> fade<00:05:32.180> comes<00:05:32.419> out<00:05:32.569> of<00:05:32.689> here

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
does do when the fade comes out of here

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.990 
does do when the fade comes out of here
