00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.430

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.750

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.290
 zaragoza me encantan zaragoza zaragoza 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.850
 yes it is true that you have things that you do not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.189
 they have other cities you have very things 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.500
 curious there are some thanks things of 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.340
 zaragoza for example zaragoza has a 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 neighborhood that is called the fountains and there 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.030
 a fountain 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.840
 big and pretty 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.710
 once that gorilla did it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.530
 first the source and we're going to do it 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.850
 now in the neighborhood we will do we are going to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.710
 call the sources with two balls 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.040
 after more we are going to make houses 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.040
 best 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 and the centuries 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 there are many things because you have to have 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.069
 a value in the sources a source then 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.660
 It has a neighborhood called Las 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.470
 delights that I say since there is a pussy 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.470
 giant at the entrance 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.380
 delight is not the station 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.930
 station I think that station too 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.930
 great and pretty 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.390
 that this action is good because you take the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.070
 train and arrive in Madrid at a time 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.310
 how much you leave the station is almost there 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.310
 in Madrid 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.849
 I claim the old stations the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.620
 of a grela of the door of Carmen 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.920
 that had yonki there is a lyric for 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 achievement 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.680
 I always asked you for logroño there 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.750
 valued I said that there will be in logroño 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.020
 plus 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 I was in logroño and in logroño reina 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.600
 in logroño the only thing there is yonki 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.560
 influencing some briqa law to 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.560
 get back to the boot 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.730
 has very curious things zaragoza has 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.260
 in valdespartera that is a town that is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.280
 a neighborhood that we have been made to 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.620
 Outskirts of Teruel is very cool 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.540
 very well 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.069
 have with the very curious there are so many 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.599
 things of zaragoza for example has 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.390
 things that go that man has already 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.459
 since it seems that it goes to the hair because 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.950
 for example look there is a street where 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.030
 are all the stores all these of the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.269
 cool and the bizarre if all these 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.269
 OK 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.480
 are all the meetings to go 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.040
 the girls come as it is called the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.040
 street the ladies walk 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.660
 everything well that you want to buy goes to the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.660
 horse street 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.790
 A) Yes 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.180
 this is so 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.160
 where is the bullet the girls of the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.460
 last weekend in the afternoon in the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.460
 auditorium 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.840
 everything you want to buy the video 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.639
 we must buy a T - shirt from 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.230
 bilbao athletic something in the cut 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.620
 English hypercor I have afterwards in the 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.620
 independence 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.220
 I also like zaragoza because it has 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.220
 beach and beach is football a salou 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.460
 and clear 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.770
 I have a theory I think we are 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.250
 conquering little by little 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.419
 every summer one more family that will arrive 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.919
 a summer not long, not 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.819
 we will all look and we will say we are already 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.819
 we are flag capo 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.860
 our 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.090
 that always dwells to me I love to go to 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.900
 except and whenever you go things happen to you 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.060
 funny 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.400
 I was on the beach 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.750
 weekly a man said three days 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.960
 without eating I told him then you can 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.960
 bath 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.130
 but friends for saying something negative 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.960
 of Zaragoza because it also has its 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.820
 curiosities a little bit its oddities a little 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.849
 negative I have to say that for 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.999
 example in zaragoza does not snow 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.869
 this is so nobody sees anything very much 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:42.789
 cold cold wave come cold come true 

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:44.199
 there it comes that it only serves so that 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.409
 that these who paint the curtain of 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.969
 Health 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:52.989
 come idea 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:57.120
 but it does not snow does not snow today some days 

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:58.790
 it snows from time to time it snows 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.340
 It is true 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.860
 every now and then it snows this is like that but 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.860
 when it snows it does not curdle 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.960
 is the boot does not set friends 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.170
 because because this can be for two 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.740
 motives the first one that for pump is 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.740
 made of salt 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.570
 no I do not know lionel to suck 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.050
 the second reason that is the one that most 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.460
 convinces that it is that little snow there 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.440
 they give everything to the clear mayor 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.400
 so 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.400
 it can not 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.550
 friends thank you very much for being here 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.300
 thank you so much for betting on the 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:56.030
 comedy we will continue to bet 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.160
 for her and betting on laughter and now 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.630
 If I'm going to leave, I'll leave you 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.759
 with what you have come to see a 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.550
 world premiere is the only comedian 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.410
 Spanish that does say its name in English 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.620
 it's a redundancy because it would be joaquin 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.620
 guil
