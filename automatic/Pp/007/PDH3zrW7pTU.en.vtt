fast-paced<00:00:41.250> than<00:00:41.879> raymond<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.390> ginger<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> in

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
fast-paced than raymond or ginger and in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.380 
fast-paced than raymond or ginger and in

about this one because ubisoft's

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.220 
about this one because ubisoft's
consistency<00:03:31.910> with<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.270> Rayman<00:03:32.720> character

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
consistency with the Rayman character

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.900 
consistency with the Rayman character
has<00:03:33.740> not<00:03:33.920> been<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.190> greatest<00:03:34.370> throughout<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
has not been the greatest throughout the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.020 
has not been the greatest throughout the
years<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:36.500> looks<00:03:36.860> really<00:03:37.370> good<00:03:37.550> on<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
years but this looks really good on and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.080 
years but this looks really good on and
and<00:03:38.270> now<00:03:38.750> I'm<00:03:39.110> kind<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.890> more<00:03:40.250> optimistic

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
and now I'm kind of like more optimistic

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.510 
and now I'm kind of like more optimistic
about<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:42.230> whole<00:03:42.380> Nintendo<00:03:42.920> thing<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
about the whole Nintendo thing and the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.280 
about the whole Nintendo thing and the
whole<00:03:43.640> way<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.880> think<00:03:44.240> so<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.540> was<00:03:44.810> really<00:03:45.050> glad

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
whole way you think so I was really glad

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.230 
whole way you think so I was really glad
to<00:03:45.410> see<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.800> game<00:03:45.950> yeah<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.340> was<00:03:46.550> really

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
to see this game yeah this was really

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.240 
to see this game yeah this was really
good<00:03:47.420> for<00:03:47.840> yuva<00:03:48.170> soft<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.650> really<00:03:48.800> good<00:03:49.070> for

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
good for yuva soft and really good for

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.740 
good for yuva soft and really good for
Nintendo<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.730> think<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:50.570> where

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
Nintendo I think I really like where

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.330 
Nintendo I think I really like where
they're<00:03:50.900> taking<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.260> Rayman<00:03:51.530> franchise<00:03:52.040> and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
they're taking the Rayman franchise and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.580 
they're taking the Rayman franchise and
I<00:03:52.550> think<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.300> is<00:03:53.480> gonna<00:03:53.720> be<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> huge<00:03:54.200> draw

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
I think this is gonna be a huge draw

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.380 
I think this is gonna be a huge draw
when<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.070> wii<00:03:55.190> u<00:03:55.310> actually<00:03:55.490> launches<00:03:56.120> just
