00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
better team but some question marks what

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.539 
better team but some question marks what
do<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> expect<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> him<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.830> 2050<00:01:08.280> yeah

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
there's certainly a gap now from one to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
there's certainly a gap now from one to
two<00:01:10.860> between<00:01:11.189> crock<00:01:11.880> ang<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.570> Jimmy<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.260> mean

obviously he went from going from a team

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
obviously he went from going from a team
who<00:01:16.770> had<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.340> second-most<00:01:17.729> pass<00:01:18.000> attempts<00:01:18.330> in

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.160 
number four probably a little bit too
high<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.310> know<00:03:01.640> in<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.880> teepee<00:03:02.240> he's<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:03.080> know

being drafted as a third tie down off
the<00:03:04.760> board<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.000> think<00:03:05.209> that's<00:03:05.360> too<00:03:05.540> high<00:03:05.690> I'd

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the board I think that's too high I'd

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.449 
the board I think that's too high I'd
rather<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.410> guy<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:06.709> Greg<00:03:06.860> Olson<00:03:07.160> over<00:03:07.340> him

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
rather a guy like Greg Olson over him

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.560 
rather a guy like Greg Olson over him

you<00:03:29.720> got<00:03:29.810> Jeremy<00:03:30.110> Maclin<00:03:30.320> there<00:03:30.620> now<00:03:30.769> who<00:03:30.920> can

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
you got Jeremy Maclin there now who can

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.979 
you got Jeremy Maclin there now who can
stretch<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.430> field<00:03:31.610> Alex<00:03:32.540> Smith<00:03:32.720> who<00:03:32.840> can

stretch the field Alex Smith who can

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.540 
stretch the field Alex Smith who can
throw<00:03:33.140> over<00:03:33.350> ten<00:03:33.560> yards<00:03:33.980> which<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.310> probably

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
throw over ten yards which is probably

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.060 
throw over ten yards which is probably
not<00:03:34.730> good<00:03:34.850> for<00:03:34.910> Jeremy<00:03:35.209> Maclin<00:03:35.390> but<00:03:35.930> he<00:03:36.860> can

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
not good for Jeremy Maclin but he can

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.590 
not good for Jeremy Maclin but he can
stretch<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> field<00:03:37.610> there's<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.910> threat<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.570> I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
stretch a field there's a threat there I

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.870 
stretch a field there's a threat there I
mean<00:03:38.840> half<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.590> his<00:03:39.709> yards<00:03:40.040> came<00:03:40.280> from<00:03:40.489> catches

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
mean half of his yards came from catches

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.630 
mean half of his yards came from catches
between<00:03:41.209> 0<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.780> 1<00:03:42.170> yard<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.590> nine<00:03:42.739> yards<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.430> I

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
between 0 and 1 yard and nine yards so I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.580 
between 0 and 1 yard and nine yards so I
still<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.150> Kelsey<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.230> only<00:03:45.380> thing<00:03:45.500> that

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
still like Kelsey the only thing that

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.539 
still like Kelsey the only thing that
got<00:03:45.709> him<00:03:45.799> in<00:03:45.860> trouble<00:03:45.890> last<00:03:46.160> year<00:03:46.280> had<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
got him in trouble last year had the

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.130 
got him in trouble last year had the
most<00:03:46.700> fumbles<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.299> all<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:47.660> football<00:03:47.780> among

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
most fumbles and all of football among

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.350 
most fumbles and all of football among
tight<00:03:48.320> ends<00:03:48.530> with<00:03:48.650> four<00:03:48.950> but<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.730> think<00:03:50.000> Kelsey

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
tight ends with four but I think Kelsey

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.520 
tight ends with four but I think Kelsey
I<00:03:50.390> think<00:03:50.630> his<00:03:50.720> targets<00:03:51.049> go<00:03:51.140> up<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.320> think<00:03:51.440> he's

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
I think his targets go up I think he's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.530 
I think his targets go up I think he's
yards<00:03:51.799> go<00:03:51.920> up<00:03:52.100> he's<00:03:52.850> always<00:03:53.209> on<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.360> field

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
yards go up he's always on the field

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.660 
yards go up he's always on the field
because<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:54.019> that<00:03:54.140> run<00:03:54.350> blocking<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:55.580> know

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
because of that run blocking you know

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.530 
because of that run blocking you know
they're<00:03:55.880> still<00:03:56.000> going<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.180> run<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.390> ball

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
they're still going to run the ball

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.330 
they're still going to run the ball
there<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> lot<00:03:56.930> with<00:03:57.080> Charles<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:58.010> mean

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
there a lot with Charles but I mean

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.590 
there a lot with Charles but I mean
Kelsey<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.700> think<00:03:58.910> everything<00:03:59.150> should<00:03:59.269> go<00:03:59.420> up

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
Kelsey I think everything should go up

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.050 
Kelsey I think everything should go up
you<00:03:59.720> mean<00:03:59.840> he<00:04:00.200> bulked<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.620> over<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.880> offseason

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
you mean he bulked up over the offseason

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.050 
you mean he bulked up over the offseason
so<00:04:02.709> yeah<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:03.739> like<00:04:03.950> Kelsey<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.310> think<00:04:04.549> all<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.820> his

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
so yeah I like Kelsey I think all of his

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.729 
so yeah I like Kelsey I think all of his

so I still I like hurts a lot I love
that<00:05:30.880> offense<00:05:31.419> I<00:05:31.690> think<00:05:31.930> he's<00:05:32.050> going<00:05:32.139> to<00:05:32.199> be<00:05:32.289> a

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
that offense I think he's going to be a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.040 
that offense I think he's going to be a
red<00:05:32.500> zone<00:05:32.530> target<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:34.030> still<00:05:34.419> think<00:05:34.449> Selleck<00:05:34.960> is

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
red zone target I still think Selleck is

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.600 
red zone target I still think Selleck is
going<00:05:35.199> to<00:05:35.260> get<00:05:35.349> a<00:05:35.620> lot<00:05:35.919> of<00:05:35.949> playing<00:05:36.220> time<00:05:36.310> with

and that's one of the best Tenon's and

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.070 
and that's one of the best Tenon's and
all<00:05:48.849> football<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.479> we've<00:05:49.570> seen<00:05:49.810> you<00:05:50.020> know

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
all football and we've seen you know

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.740 
all football and we've seen you know
over<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.320> past<00:05:50.380> several<00:05:51.010> years<00:05:51.220> so<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:52.539> guess

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
over the past several years so and guess

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.000 
over the past several years so and guess
what<00:05:52.840> he's<00:05:53.080> got<00:05:53.229> Bradford<00:05:53.620> throwing<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.860> ball

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
what he's got Bradford throwing the ball

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.860 
what he's got Bradford throwing the ball
now<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:54.430> not<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.849> know<00:05:54.880> fools<00:05:55.300> really<00:05:55.690> like

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
now and not you know fools really like

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.469 
now and not you know fools really like
Selleck<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.409> lot<00:05:56.830> Foles<00:05:57.729> and<00:05:57.909> no<00:05:57.970> longer<00:05:58.240> there

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
Selleck a lot Foles and no longer there

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.870 
Selleck a lot Foles and no longer there
I<00:05:59.349> think<00:06:00.070> Bradford<00:06:00.430> is<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.610> much<00:06:00.849> better

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
I think Bradford is a much better

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.370 
I think Bradford is a much better
quarterback<00:06:01.479> than<00:06:01.510> what<00:06:01.720> Philadelphia's<00:06:02.260> had

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
quarterback than what Philadelphia's had

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
quarterback than what Philadelphia's had
over<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.530> past<00:06:02.590> couple<00:06:02.800> years<00:06:02.949> if<00:06:03.159> he<00:06:03.280> can

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
over the past couple years if he can

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.680 
over the past couple years if he can
stay<00:06:03.550> healthy<00:06:03.580> so<00:06:04.030> I<00:06:04.060> think<00:06:04.330> this<00:06:04.419> could

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
stay healthy so I think this could

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.510 
stay healthy so I think this could
actually<00:06:04.960> be<00:06:05.229> the<00:06:05.770> breakout<00:06:06.099> year<00:06:06.159> for

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
actually be the breakout year for

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.640 
actually be the breakout year for
Earth's<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.909> he's<00:06:07.090> a<00:06:07.120> big<00:06:07.300> body<00:06:07.479> a<00:06:08.289> great

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
Earth's to he's a big body a great

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.159 
Earth's to he's a big body a great
vertical<00:06:08.830> like<00:06:09.400> it's<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.030> big<00:06:10.479> red<00:06:10.659> zone<00:06:10.840> target

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
vertical like it's a big red zone target

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.439 
vertical like it's a big red zone target
as<00:06:11.229> well<00:06:11.380> so<00:06:11.680> yeah<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.699> think<00:06:12.729> our<00:06:12.970> its<00:06:13.060> be<00:06:13.330> I

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
as well so yeah I think our its be I

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.029 
as well so yeah I think our its be I
think<00:06:13.720> Kurt's<00:06:13.960> can<00:06:14.349> have<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.680> breakout<00:06:15.010> year

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
think Kurt's can have the breakout year

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.740 
think Kurt's can have the breakout year
that<00:06:15.580> we<00:06:15.699> thought<00:06:15.940> last<00:06:16.300> year<00:06:16.479> when<00:06:16.720> we

masta<00:06:39.430> of<00:06:39.580> quarterbacks<00:06:40.150> there<00:06:40.360> now<00:06:40.570> he's

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170 
masta of quarterbacks there now he's

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.780 
masta of quarterbacks there now he's
going<00:06:41.290> to<00:06:41.380> Marcus<00:06:41.680> Mariota<00:06:41.950> certainly<00:06:42.490> a<00:06:42.520> step

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
going to Marcus Mariota certainly a step

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.880 
going to Marcus Mariota certainly a step
up<00:06:43.000> but<00:06:43.450> still<00:06:43.660> a<00:06:43.690> rookie<00:06:43.930> quarterback<00:06:44.590> so<00:06:44.800> do

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
up but still a rookie quarterback so do

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.260 
up but still a rookie quarterback so do
you<00:06:44.950> think<00:06:45.010> it's<00:06:45.400> more<00:06:45.880> or<00:06:45.970> less<00:06:46.030> the<00:06:46.240> same

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
you think it's more or less the same

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.090 
you think it's more or less the same
situation<00:06:47.050> for<00:06:47.200> Delanie<00:06:47.470> Walker<00:06:47.500> where<00:06:47.950> he's

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
situation for Delanie Walker where he's

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.710 
situation for Delanie Walker where he's
going<00:06:48.280> to<00:06:48.340> be<00:06:48.400> playing<00:06:48.640> a<00:06:48.940> for<00:06:49.480> a<00:06:49.510> rookie

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
going to be playing a for a rookie

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.210 
going to be playing a for a rookie
quarterback<00:06:50.080> looking<00:06:50.320> to<00:06:50.380> dump<00:06:50.530> it<00:06:50.650> off<00:06:50.800> yeah

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
quarterback looking to dump it off yeah

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.340 
quarterback looking to dump it off yeah
I<00:06:51.250> think<00:06:51.520> so<00:06:51.940> but<00:06:52.210> at<00:06:52.450> the<00:06:52.570> same<00:06:52.750> time<00:06:52.990> Delanie

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
I think so but at the same time Delanie

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.720 
I think so but at the same time Delanie
Walker<00:06:53.380> coming<00:06:53.890> off<00:06:54.010> a<00:06:54.040> career<00:06:54.310> high<00:06:54.430> in

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
Walker coming off a career high in

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.430 
Walker coming off a career high in
basically<00:06:55.180> every<00:06:55.300> single<00:06:55.990> offensive
