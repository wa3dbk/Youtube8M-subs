00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.400
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.860
 new video to a new lightroom 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.760
 video more specifically and this time 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.180
 let's edit a picture in black 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.300
 white and it's about the picture here 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.550
 there is yes from annika to the shooting 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.080
 already a hand-held scenes video 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.529
 there can even look if you can 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.289
 have not seen yet and yes we 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.090
 Just start directly 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.519
 I'll create a virtual one 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.090
 Copy the picture and then set it 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:41.899
 just completely back if that 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:48.710
 because now it works and then you see 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:50.360
 already the original picture and then start 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.250
 Of course, I first and set that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.199
 all over here on black knows my 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.989
 basic setting and then I see already 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.300
 let's see how it looks and I like it 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.070
 Of course not yet black 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 In my opinion, white always has to be one 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.520
 bit you always need a bit 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.549
 more contrast so to my taste 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.110
 and that's why I'm going here and 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.110
 first raise the contrast a bit 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.220
 and then here with the 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.520
 Editing curve the contrast bit 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.520
 increase 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.240
 then I look already and then 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.560
 it works a bit already 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.290
 upbeat I say the lights can 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.590
 you can still get the lights on you 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.590
 to let 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.170
 make with this black and white mixture 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.750
 I actually can not do that much here 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.360
 you turn the reddish bit upwards 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.670
 pull something else in the face 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.970
 I will clarify 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.320
 and also the orange tones here yes me 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.060
 think that's it 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.830
 most of what you do here because the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.300
 shades of green, of course, only change here 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.670
 subtly in the background 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.390
 that does not really bring anything 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.390
 blues are not 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.830
 We can actually do the jeans 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.960
 also original so let's say 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720
 There is not much to do here now 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.220
 there you can start with the regulators 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.740
 and try it out like I did the grad 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.660
 and then you see where something is 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.970
 changes in black and white you have then 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.150
 the possibility of targeted colors again 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.680
 or so to change so yes then I do 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.880
 here are the profile corrections 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.090
 just so that the distortion is gone 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.330
 but the government is back 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.870
 down 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.550
 because that affects the effect of so 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.170
 center here or year gives off 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.959
 it beside the viewer more into the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.390
 focus here on our model and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.880
 if we have the edges there too 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.730
 then lighten up the picture somehow 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.690
 only so flat and there is none 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.680
 right no right point 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.110
 which the viewer is drawn like that 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.660
 then I 'll go to the Galazions here 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.290
 come and see her down here too 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.390
 the black point up a bit 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.360
 so that the black values â€‹â€‹cut something 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 become 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.150
 That's why you have that way black 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.459
 not really black but is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.950
 already grayed but I find that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.630
 black and white often very cool 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.820
 and 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.680
 I think the contrast can still be 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:57.410
 raise a bit here 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.790
 with that the curve still further and 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.530
 then we already have the picture 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.570
 as far as I had before 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.910
 now up here still radial filter 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.360
 take up here move up 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.620
 so that's a bit more here 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.989
 is outshined above, so to speak 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.450
 There are no formulas, so to speak 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.230
 how to process your picture is to luck 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.270
 they do not exist 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:29.060
 then of course everyone can do what he does 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.670
 want and you can just hang around 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.170
 I play it that way, too 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.250
 you would have to have a completely different picture 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.120
 just look like it's the best 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.140
 So that looks like every picture now 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.850
 to do everything like that 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.590
 I do things with the black and white stuff 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.180
 actually generally very often so the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.470
 then fits in the pictures synonymous on there 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.500
 can you see if that at yours 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.310
 also fits otherwise would have to just because 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:56.470
 play around a bit so I would 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:00.479
 actually let it go 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.530
 maybe you can still with one here 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.580
 History filters the whole thing a bit 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.310
 brighten 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.750
 that is too much just here 15 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.259
 015 increase the exposure 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.330
 then we just got up there 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.680
 he adds a little lighter and 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.729
 It looks a bit outshined 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.349
 yes, maybe you can 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:30.849
 there's the little brighten brighten 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:33.550
 the annika already very bright eyes 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.560
 But then I just take that 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.719
 brush and a little bit in here 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.469
 that is of course far too much but that 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.520
 I can change later on 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:49.090
 and now i can do a lot of exposure 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.599
 adjust this from a painted brush 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.919
 so to speak and thus just that 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.919
 adjust eyes 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.500
 then I can not do it here 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.650
 so only the ones after that look 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.510
 these eyes so the brush thing now 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.790
 hide and show again 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.270
 and maybe that says again 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:18.740
 look afar and then I find that 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:23.060
 a bit too much so as a 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.920
 that's enough, that's enough 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.480
 to a black and white processing so 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.150
 It's not all witchcraft 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.040
 As I said, I am white on black 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.420
 and then it rains a bit in contrast 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.880
 and here also the contrast with the 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.190
 s curve maybe I cut too 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.310
 here the shoes still the black values 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.160
 Something and we hereby you can also in the 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.450
 play with the black and white mixture 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.940
 otherwise I have not now 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.590
 Really done what if you backlight 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.400
 you can filter with the radial 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.630
 and maybe a little something there 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.840
 increase the pressure increase of 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.560
 a back light and otherwise that is 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.360
 actually already 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.980
 yes I hope you could do something with the 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.840
 start video if you have questions 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.000
 Just write in the comments 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.470
 and if you do not have my channel yet 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.930
 Subscribe then you can do it 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.670
 The button down here then presses 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.200
 you do not miss new videos anymore 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.910
 that was then i still have you here 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.470
 two videos linked there you can 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.540
 look as determined what is interesting 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.590
 also for you and then you can 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.770
 you look straight ahead 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.850
 Well then thank you for watching and 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.850
 Until next time
