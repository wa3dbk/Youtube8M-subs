00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello dear viewers 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.690
 the continuation has come and now I will be with 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.240
 you run in here is such a part 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.340
 on the fixture that we just 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.960
 if someone did something to you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 missed come visit 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 subscribe to the channel click 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 physiognomy and you will be aware of all 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.550
 events that are happening on my channel my 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.700
 lab so now i 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:39.149
 I exhibit a detail on the Roman which I gave 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.610
 for here this position is like that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.210
 tune in with a cunning device 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.850
 here you can have it all on my channel 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.789
 but I say this while clamping the part so 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.910
 so a little stronger 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:00.059
 dropping the clamps and the table as you see 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.609
 here comes the rotation of one 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.070
 the end of the century to another limit switch 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.350
 and in the process of running I will be it 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.900
 drive back and forth and now I take a closer look 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:21.180
 go to the world to be more vividly 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:28.580
 everything is visible so I checked access all 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.580
 there is so well and let's go for poses 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.040
 Well, now it's time to clean 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.860
 passageway 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.910
 if you notice then all your passes 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.980
 are rude 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.980
 which I did just what I did on 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.410
 I will meet the tooth a clean pass 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.530
 do under the tooth and depth of cut 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.530
 will be only three hundredths of a millimeter 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.590
 Well, that's all I cut to the side 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.040
 so that it no longer inflicts any 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:40.800
 scratch must be clamped then 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:45.240
 to unscrew the product and here you are 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.110
 Here such has turned out pretty 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.110
 pretty about 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:12.959
 comments are unnecessary shine and beauty 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.450
 Well, in the same way we put the following 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.090
 detail 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.530
 before you put the next item 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.130
 all must be cleaned to the surface 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.199
 of touch 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.199
 contact with the item was without any 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:40.820
 cure stricter te sorinok all this 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.820
 unacceptable so 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.790
 I exhibit again at risk because 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:59.330
 if not perpendicular 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:03.320
 in relation to the table, then in general it can 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.290
 get a marriage so here's the parian i 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.690
 put that for risk what yes how what 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.390
 where can you look in the previous 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.500
 my video on setting this up 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.500
 devices 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:24.830
 everything is quite good in my opinion 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:31.720
 shown here from this angle 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.720
 shoot a little bit well in the same way 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.810
 here's one more detail ready on this one 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.000
 Perhaps and finish as you see the system 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.630
 Everything works fine , I can still 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.770
 add 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.960
 the fact that she herself adapts this is attached 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:03.550
 nuts of a different size 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:08.319
 let's say here if these nuts go with me 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:11.889
 which fix the item 22 face value then 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:15.039
 here this key is not suitable for 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.259
 inadvertently do not turn all on 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:20.770
 maybe in general it can be turned away 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:25.599
 this nut this nut here when details 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:27.729
 much it is not excluded so thanks for 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.800
 attention dear viewers do not forget 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.520
 subscribe to the channel click my 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.130
 physiognomy 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.099
 and you will be aware of all that 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:40.569
 everything is happening in my laboratory 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:43.210
 inventions will be posted online on 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:46.690
 youtube but that's not all at once of course 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:50.469
 how it takes time 1 in the process 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:53.110
 I will show you all the work I'll tell you with 

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:58.169
