I<00:00:31.360> like<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:32.570> trick<00:00:32.980> because<00:00:33.980> I<00:00:34.610> can't<00:00:34.879> really

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
I like this trick because I can't really

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.540 
I like this trick because I can't really
do<00:00:35.239> switch<00:00:35.570> kick<00:00:35.809> flips<00:00:36.050> or<00:00:36.680> switch<00:00:37.250> Ollie's

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
do switch kick flips or switch Ollie's

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
do switch kick flips or switch Ollie's
that<00:00:37.730> good<00:00:39.040> so<00:00:40.040> I<00:00:40.070> still<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:40.879> learned<00:00:41.269> it<00:00:41.360> cuz<00:00:41.510> I

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
that good so I still I learned it cuz I

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.910 
that good so I still I learned it cuz I
still<00:00:41.750> wanted<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.050> do<00:00:42.230> some<00:00:42.500> kind<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.769> this

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
still wanted to do some kind of this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.320 
still wanted to do some kind of this
switch<00:00:43.910> movie<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:46.280> it's<00:00:46.790> easier<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:47.180> if

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
switch movie and it's it's easier if if

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.079 
switch movie and it's it's easier if if
you<00:00:47.449> land<00:00:47.660> regular<00:00:48.640> some<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.790> things<00:00:49.970> you

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
you land regular some of the things you

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.729 
you land regular some of the things you
need<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.360> know<00:00:50.449> before<00:00:50.720> you<00:00:51.050> start<00:00:51.320> trying

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
need to know before you start trying

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.109 
need to know before you start trying
this<00:00:52.360> it's<00:00:53.360> not<00:00:53.540> much<00:00:53.720> as<00:00:54.230> it's<00:00:54.909> switch<00:00:55.909> Ollie

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
this it's not much as it's switch Ollie

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.390 
this it's not much as it's switch Ollie
pretty<00:00:56.690> good<00:00:56.839> and<00:00:57.049> then<00:00:57.170> just<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.190> get<00:00:58.309> the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
pretty good and then just to get the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.079 
pretty good and then just to get the
motion<00:00:58.580> down<00:00:58.760> maybe<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.390> fakie<00:01:00.019> front<00:01:00.260> half<00:01:00.440> cab

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
motion down maybe a fakie front half cab

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.549 
motion down maybe a fakie front half cab
just<00:01:02.089> so<00:01:02.180> you're<00:01:02.299> getting<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:02.690> same<00:01:02.960> turning

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
just so you're getting that same turning

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.750 
just so you're getting that same turning
motion<00:01:03.760> and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
motion and

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.280 
motion and
that's<00:01:07.300> about<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.810> how<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.870> set<00:01:11.110> up<00:01:11.260> for

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
that's about it so how you set up for

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.660 
that's about it so how you set up for
the<00:01:11.740> Switchback<00:01:12.280> 180<00:01:13.770> basically<00:01:14.770> like<00:01:14.920> switch

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
the Switchback 180 basically like switch

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.760 
the Switchback 180 basically like switch
ollie<00:01:15.880> but<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:16.870> hang<00:01:17.050> your<00:01:17.200> toes<00:01:17.410> over<00:01:17.620> a

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
ollie but you hang your toes over a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.580 
ollie but you hang your toes over a
little<00:01:17.920> bit<00:01:18.010> more<00:01:19.260> because<00:01:20.260> as<00:01:20.410> you're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
little bit more because as you're

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.090 
little bit more because as you're
turning<00:01:20.800> your<00:01:22.140> tongue<00:01:23.140> foot<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.800> basically

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
turning your tongue foot is basically

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.230 
turning your tongue foot is basically
gonna<00:01:24.310> be<00:01:24.400> guiding<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.120> board<00:01:25.440> around

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
gonna be guiding the board around

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.580 
gonna be guiding the board around
sometimes<00:01:28.240> your<00:01:28.450> back<00:01:28.660> foot<00:01:28.930> even<00:01:29.170> comes<00:01:29.380> off

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
sometimes your back foot even comes off

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.370 
sometimes your back foot even comes off
and<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:29.950> still<00:01:30.250> land<00:01:30.400> it<00:01:31.050> as<00:01:32.050> long<00:01:32.230> as

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and you can still land it as long as

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.840 
and you can still land it as long as
you're<00:01:32.500> felt<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:32.950> pretty<00:01:33.280> solid<00:01:33.730> on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
you're felt so it's pretty solid on

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.420 
you're felt so it's pretty solid on
there<00:01:34.470> after<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.530> pop<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:35.980> you're<00:01:36.220> in<00:01:36.310> the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
there after you pop it and you're in the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.080 
there after you pop it and you're in the
air<00:01:36.550> you're<00:01:37.150> gonna<00:01:37.360> be<00:01:37.570> already<00:01:38.140> probably

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
air you're gonna be already probably

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.440 
air you're gonna be already probably
about<00:01:40.090> 90<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:42.160> you're<00:01:42.340> just<00:01:42.490> gonna<00:01:42.610> keep<00:01:43.270> your

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
about 90 and you're just gonna keep your

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.850 
about 90 and you're just gonna keep your
legs<00:01:43.630> kind<00:01:43.870> of<00:01:43.990> sucked<00:01:44.170> up<00:01:44.320> until<00:01:44.650> you're<00:01:44.740> all

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
legs kind of sucked up until you're all

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.220 
legs kind of sucked up until you're all
the<00:01:44.890> way<00:01:44.980> around<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.550> then<00:01:45.970> once<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.900> spot

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
the way around and then once you spot

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.380 
the way around and then once you spot
whatever<00:01:47.710> if<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.160> clear<00:01:48.430> doing<00:01:48.760> your<00:01:49.180> gap

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
whatever if you clear doing your gap

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.660 
whatever if you clear doing your gap
your<00:01:49.690> stairs<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.320> want<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.560> we're<00:01:51.340> gonna<00:01:51.430> put

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
your stairs you want to we're gonna put

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.880 
your stairs you want to we're gonna put
it<00:01:51.760> down<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.330> once<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.350> get<00:01:53.500> around<00:01:53.650> just

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
it down and once you get around just

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.450 
it down and once you get around just
slam<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.100> down<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:56.320> your<00:01:57.160> shoulders

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
slam it down and your your shoulders

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.370 
slam it down and your your shoulders
might<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.210> be<00:01:58.360> kind<00:01:58.660> of<00:01:58.750> turned<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.050> little<00:01:59.260> bit

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
might so be kind of turned a little bit

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.380 
might so be kind of turned a little bit
so<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.680> won't<00:01:59.860> really<00:02:00.070> be<00:02:00.430> seeing<00:02:01.180> where

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
so you won't really be seeing where

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.480 
so you won't really be seeing where
you're<00:02:01.510> going<00:02:01.810> just<00:02:02.050> yet<00:02:02.140> but<00:02:02.920> after<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.280> land

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
you're going just yet but after you land

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.580 
you're going just yet but after you land
it<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.730> kind<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.060> have<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.960> momentum<00:02:05.260> and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
it you kind of have that momentum and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.230 
it you kind of have that momentum and
turn<00:02:05.920> all<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.130> way<00:02:06.160> around<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.640> write<00:02:07.060> out

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
turn all the way around and write out

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.359 
turn all the way around and write out
some<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> things<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.320> can<00:02:08.470> go<00:02:08.590> along<00:02:08.890> on

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
some of the things that can go along on

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.290 
some of the things that can go along on
the<00:02:09.730> switchback<00:02:10.090> 180<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:16.150> you're

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
the switchback 180 if you if you're

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.449 
the switchback 180 if you if you're
coming<00:02:16.480> down<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.900> you're<00:02:16.990> not<00:02:17.170> fully<00:02:17.620> fully

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
coming down and you're not fully fully
