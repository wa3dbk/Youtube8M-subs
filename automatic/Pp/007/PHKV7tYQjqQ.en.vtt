00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
pretty well on the highway never would

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.830 
pretty well on the highway never would

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.570 

so<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.460> mean<00:02:29.510> other<00:02:30.510> than<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:31.400> thing<00:02:32.400> those

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
so I mean other than that thing those

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.840 
so I mean other than that thing those
are<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.820> updates<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.510> far
