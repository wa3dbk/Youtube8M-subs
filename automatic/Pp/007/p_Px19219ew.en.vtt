00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.180 
I beat the game in about an average
sitcom<00:00:43.570> length<00:00:43.780> about<00:00:44.350> half<00:00:44.590> an<00:00:44.710> hour<00:00:44.800> someone

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
sitcom length about half an hour someone

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.460 
sitcom length about half an hour someone
about<00:00:45.370> 25<00:00:45.820> minutes<00:00:46.000> it's<00:00:46.660> one<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:46.960> those<00:00:47.110> that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
about 25 minutes it's one of those that

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.110 
about 25 minutes it's one of those that
it's<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.860> shame<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.190> doesn't<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.490> about<00:00:48.700> 100

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
it's a shame it doesn't have about 100

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.300 
it's a shame it doesn't have about 100
or<00:00:49.210> 200<00:00:49.630> levels<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.140> actually<00:00:50.950> go<00:00:51.280> through

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
or 200 levels I actually go through

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.220 
or 200 levels I actually go through
because<00:00:51.730> you'd<00:00:52.330> pull<00:00:52.600> through<00:00:52.630> it<00:00:52.900> because<00:00:53.080> of

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
because you'd pull through it because of

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.260 
because you'd pull through it because of
how<00:00:53.380> fun<00:00:53.590> it<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:53.800> basically<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.910> whole<00:00:55.030> point

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
how fun it is basically the whole point

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.060 
how fun it is basically the whole point
is<00:00:55.510> you've<00:00:56.050> got<00:00:56.230> to<00:00:56.260> collect<00:00:56.590> crystals

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
is you've got to collect crystals

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.410 
is you've got to collect crystals
whenever<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.490> collect<00:00:57.730> two<00:00:57.850> crystal<00:00:58.270> it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
whenever you collect two crystal it

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.630 
whenever you collect two crystal it
creates<00:00:58.750> an<00:00:58.870> echo<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.260> yourself<00:00:59.650> now<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.220> echo

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
creates an echo of yourself now the echo

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.980 
creates an echo of yourself now the echo
is<00:01:00.700> killing<00:01:01.060> it<00:01:01.120> if<00:01:01.300> you're<00:01:01.420> walk-in<00:01:01.570> what<00:01:01.900> you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
is killing it if you're walk-in what you

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.480 
is killing it if you're walk-in what you
lose<00:01:02.110> alike<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.650> once<00:01:02.980> you've<00:01:03.100> lost<00:01:03.250> all<00:01:03.460> your

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
lose alike and once you've lost all your

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.280 
lose alike and once you've lost all your
lives<00:01:03.700> for<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.000> level<00:01:04.150> then<00:01:04.659> that's<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:05.019> gear

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
lives for the level then that's it gear

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.320 
lives for the level then that's it gear
more<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:05.950> there<00:01:06.280> we<00:01:06.369> go<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.910> get<00:01:07.090> four

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
more but so there we go you get four

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.030 
more but so there we go you get four
lives<00:01:07.570> pretty<00:01:07.840> much<00:01:07.930> per<00:01:08.260> level<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.830> can

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
lives pretty much per level and you can

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.520 
lives pretty much per level and you can
gain<00:01:09.280> more<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:10.720> whole<00:01:10.840> point<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:11.260> just

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
gain more and the whole point is just

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.110 
gain more and the whole point is just
have<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.800> collect<00:01:12.010> all<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.250> crystals<00:01:12.700> and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
have to collect all the crystals and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.330 
have to collect all the crystals and
avoid<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.810> air<00:01:13.930> cause<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.470> that's<00:01:15.100> about<00:01:15.220> it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
avoid the air cause and that's about it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.430 
avoid the air cause and that's about it
really<00:01:15.550> go<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.300> next<00:01:16.360> level<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:17.230> out

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
really go on to the next level this out

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.440 
really go on to the next level this out
only<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.310> handful<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:18.820> levels<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.270> about

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
only a handful of levels is about

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.690 
only a handful of levels is about
despite<00:01:20.080> being<00:01:20.260> four<00:01:20.560> worlds<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.010> about<00:01:21.190> 21

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
despite being four worlds is about 21

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.580 
despite being four worlds is about 21
levels<00:01:22.030> overall<00:01:22.390> which<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.870> why<00:01:23.050> you<00:01:23.110> can<00:01:23.409> beat

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
levels overall which is why you can beat

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.680 
levels overall which is why you can beat
it<00:01:23.620> in<00:01:23.860> about<00:01:24.010> half<00:01:24.280> an<00:01:24.400> hour<00:01:24.690> especially

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
it in about half an hour especially

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.330 
it in about half an hour especially
because<00:01:25.870> it's<00:01:26.110> not<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.380> hard<00:01:26.770> either<00:01:26.980> which

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
is a sham despite looking like it might

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.750

more<00:03:04.300> seconds<00:03:04.690> really<00:03:04.930> then<00:03:05.290> you've<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.530> got

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
more seconds really then you've just got

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.350 
more seconds really then you've just got
as<00:03:05.740> far<00:03:05.800> as<00:03:06.070> long<00:03:06.160> as<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.520> by<00:03:06.970> crashing

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
as far as long as you can by crashing

into the air cause as you might notice

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.760 
into the air cause as you might notice
it<00:03:08.890> decreases<00:03:09.670> your<00:03:09.760> time<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.330> it's<00:03:10.770> just

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
go off off really more blow it's more of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920 
go off off really more blow it's more of
a<00:03:14.980> time<00:03:15.130> trial<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.610> survival<00:03:16.060> you've<00:03:16.720> then

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
got clockworkmod and clockworkmod still

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.230 
got clockworkmod and clockworkmod still
gives<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.620> echoes<00:03:20.980> sorry<00:03:21.940> well<00:03:22.120> that

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
stationary so you have to basically work

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.020 
stationary so you have to basically work
your<00:03:29.290> way<00:03:29.380> around<00:03:29.530> them<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.130> work<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.640> best
