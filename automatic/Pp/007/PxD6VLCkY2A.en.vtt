and what it can mean two here we have
the<00:00:21.480> speed<00:00:21.750> test<00:00:21.990> app<00:00:22.310> fairly<00:00:23.310> reliable<00:00:23.850> way

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the speed test app fairly reliable way

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.300 
the speed test app fairly reliable way
to<00:00:24.029> know<00:00:24.420> how<00:00:24.689> what<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.590> downloads<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
to know how what your downloads and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.070 
to know how what your downloads and
upload<00:00:26.609> speeds<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.689> we're<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.960> run

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
upload speeds are so we're going to run

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.600 
upload speeds are so we're going to run
this<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.529> little<00:00:28.890> bit<00:00:33.860> I've<00:00:34.860> been<00:00:35.250> pretty

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this a little bit I've been pretty

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
this a little bit I've been pretty
impressed<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.239> whatever<00:00:36.540> see<00:00:36.899> been

impressed with whatever see been
receiving<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> phone<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.700> I've<00:00:39.180> used<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
receiving on the phone and I've used the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.139 
receiving on the phone and I've used the
the<00:00:40.140> network<00:00:40.440> before<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.160> various<00:00:41.969> locations

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the network before in various locations

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
the network before in various locations
where<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.809> san<00:00:42.989> francisco<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
where in san francisco right now and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.750 
where in san francisco right now and
it's<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.850> been<00:00:45.030> pretty<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.579> looks

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it's it's been pretty good so it looks

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.660 
it's it's been pretty good so it looks
like<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.300> than<00:00:54.390> five<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.960> 5.1<00:00:55.890> 10<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:58.670> 50

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
like more than five down 5.1 10 or 50

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.420 
like more than five down 5.1 10 or 50
110<00:01:00.510> kilobits<00:01:01.289> per<00:01:01.379> second<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:01.949> accurately

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
110 kilobits per second more accurately

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
110 kilobits per second more accurately
and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.809> than<00:01:05.119> more<00:01:06.119> than<00:01:06.150> four<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and then more than more than four up so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
and then more than more than four up so
that's<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.670> bit<00:01:08.880> below<00:01:09.270> what

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that's actually a little bit below what

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.679 
that's actually a little bit below what
i've<00:01:09.750> seen<00:01:10.020> before<00:01:10.820> let's<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> results

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
i've seen before let's go to the results

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
i've seen before let's go to the results
page<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> I've<00:01:13.830> run<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> bunch<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
page and I've run a bunch of these just

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.429 
page and I've run a bunch of these just
before<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.900> very<00:01:18.900> fun<00:01:19.170> for

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
before just because it was very fun for

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.570 
before just because it was very fun for
me<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:21.659> last<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.680> last<00:01:22.799> couple<00:01:23.369> hours

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
me and so the last the last couple hours

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
me and so the last the last couple hours
haven't<00:01:24.210> been<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.509> fast<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.049> I've<00:01:25.200> seen<00:01:25.380> before

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
haven't been as fast as I've seen before

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
haven't been as fast as I've seen before
you're<00:01:25.890> seeing<00:01:26.130> five<00:01:26.790> you're<00:01:27.119> seeing<00:01:27.330> three

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
you're seeing five you're seeing three

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.440 
you're seeing five you're seeing three
down<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.909> 11

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
down but then you see here you have 11

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.219 
down but then you see here you have 11
down<00:01:30.689> five<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.820> 22<00:01:33.600> down

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
down five up this is actually 22 down

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.300 
down five up this is actually 22 down
and<00:01:34.590> ate<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.509> which<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:37.470> crazy<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and ate up which is pretty crazy to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.499 
and ate up which is pretty crazy to
think<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:39.619> when<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.939> when<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:41.970> mobile

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
think about when your when your mobile

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.649 
think about when your when your mobile
but<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.280> average<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:44.909> i<00:01:44.970> was<00:01:45.390> seeing

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
but if you average it out i was seeing

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.440 
but if you average it out i was seeing
about<00:01:46.229> 10<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.399> first<00:01:47.610> couple<00:01:47.970> days<00:01:48.000> using

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
about 10 for my first couple days using

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990 
about 10 for my first couple days using
this<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.710> regressed<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.820> bit

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this it's it's regressed a little bit

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.139 
this it's it's regressed a little bit
but<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.810> by<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.200> still<00:01:52.590> over<00:01:53.040> 5<00:01:53.340> pretty

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but not by much still over 5 pretty

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
but not by much still over 5 pretty
consistently<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.740> i<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.009> good<00:01:56.219> coverage

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
consistently when i have good coverage

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.330 
consistently when i have good coverage
and<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> ping<00:01:57.659> time<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.110> latency<00:01:58.380> isn't<00:01:59.189> bad

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and the ping time and latency isn't bad

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.510 
and the ping time and latency isn't bad
either<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.930> numbers<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.860> thing<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.130> what

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
either so numbers are one thing but what

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.359 
either so numbers are one thing but what
does<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.759> mean<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.200> let's<00:02:04.979> hop<00:02:05.219> in

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:16.710 
does that mean for you so let's hop in

into<00:02:24.470> mobile<00:02:24.860> cool<00:02:25.460> website<00:02:25.940> we<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.570> know<00:02:26.720> it

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.360 

if<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.250> notice<00:02:31.550> it's<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:31.820> blazing<00:02:32.810> up<00:02:33.370> as

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
if you notice it's not blazing up as

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.340 
if you notice it's not blazing up as
super<00:02:34.940> fast<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.480> would<00:02:35.630> think<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.930> but

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
super fast as you would think that but

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.870 
super fast as you would think that but
that<00:02:36.530> actually<00:02:36.860> popped<00:02:37.010> up<00:02:37.190> fast<00:02:37.460> at<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.730> end

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
that actually popped up fast at the end

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.820 
that actually popped up fast at the end

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
devices connected so what i'm going to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.880 
devices connected so what i'm going to
do<00:03:21.130> i'm<00:03:22.130> turning<00:03:22.490> on<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.640> mobile<00:03:22.820> hotspot<00:03:23.890> i'm

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
do i'm turning on the mobile hotspot i'm

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.030 
do i'm turning on the mobile hotspot i'm
going<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.130> grab<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:26.060> nearby<00:03:26.680> motorola<00:03:27.680> xoom

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
going to grab this nearby motorola xoom

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.840 
going to grab this nearby motorola xoom
and<00:03:29.680> we're<00:03:30.680> going<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.830> connect<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:31.490> run

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
and we're going to connect and then run

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.800 
and we're going to connect and then run
a<00:03:31.880> speedtest<00:03:32.240> i<00:03:34.030> was<00:03:35.030> looking<00:03:35.330> at<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> charge

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
a speedtest i was looking at the charge

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.270 
a speedtest i was looking at the charge
it<00:03:36.080> was<00:03:36.170> kind<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.410> cheating<00:03:36.830> so<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.190> can

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
it was kind of cheating so I can

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.800 
it was kind of cheating so I can
remember<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.880> specs

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:04:04.340 

oops

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.590 

I've<00:04:04.890> already<00:04:05.130> pumped<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> password

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
I've already pumped in the password

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:16.160 
I've already pumped in the password
previously<00:04:13.100> okay<00:04:14.100> we're<00:04:14.670> connected<00:04:15.240> let's

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
previously okay we're connected let's

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.990 
previously okay we're connected let's
see<00:04:16.580> how<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.640> speed<00:04:18.030> will<00:04:18.440> differentiate

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
see how the speed will differentiate

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.060 
see how the speed will differentiate
when<00:04:21.000> you're<00:04:21.120> connected<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.870> device<00:04:22.770> as

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
when you're connected on a device as

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.640 
when you're connected on a device as
opposed<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.640> directly<00:04:24.090> on<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.600> handset<00:04:25.020> and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
opposed to directly on the handset and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.160 
opposed to directly on the handset and
so<00:04:26.640> obviously<00:04:26.790> speeds<00:04:27.480> will<00:04:27.720> vary<00:04:28.020> depending

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
so obviously speeds will vary depending

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.160 
so obviously speeds will vary depending
on<00:04:28.640> where<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.850> are<00:04:29.880> coverage<00:04:30.600> area<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
on where you are coverage area and that

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.760 
on where you are coverage area and that
sort<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.530> thing<00:04:31.670> but<00:04:32.670> that<00:04:33.380> looks<00:04:34.380> pretty<00:04:34.620> good

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
sort of thing but that looks pretty good

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.790 
sort of thing but that looks pretty good
that's<00:04:35.250> eight<00:04:35.700> point<00:04:36.300> nine<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:37.050> five<00:04:37.440> point

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that's eight point nine and five point

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.430 
that's eight point nine and five point
seven<00:04:38.070> eight<00:04:38.460> point<00:04:38.790> nine<00:04:38.850> down<00:04:39.120> 5.7<00:04:39.990> up<00:04:40.170> and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
seven eight point nine down 5.7 up and

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.040 
seven eight point nine down 5.7 up and
we're<00:04:41.280> being<00:04:41.490> tethered<00:04:41.820> right<00:04:42.180> now<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.600> so

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
we're being tethered right now and so

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.140 
we're being tethered right now and so
it's<00:04:43.200> right<00:04:43.350> next<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.680> each<00:04:43.830> other<00:04:43.980> but<00:04:44.970> that's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
it's right next to each other but that's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.810 
it's right next to each other but that's
that's<00:04:45.510> pretty<00:04:45.900> good<00:04:46.110> speeds<00:04:46.620> for<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.550> mobile

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
that's pretty good speeds for the mobile

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.900 
that's pretty good speeds for the mobile
hotspot<00:04:48.950> so<00:04:49.950> one<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.370> great<00:04:50.550> things<00:04:50.790> about

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
hotspot so one of the great things about

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.900 
hotspot so one of the great things about
4G<00:04:51.450> LTE<00:04:51.690> is<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.710> gives<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.920> access<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.490> a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
4G LTE is that it gives you access to a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.240 
4G LTE is that it gives you access to a
lot<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:54.360> multimedia<00:04:54.990> content<00:04:55.680> on<00:04:55.800> your<00:04:56.040> phone

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
lot of multimedia content on your phone

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.940 
lot of multimedia content on your phone
quicker<00:04:56.810> so<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.050> want<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.320> go<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.500> could

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
quicker so if you want to go you could

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.220 
quicker so if you want to go you could
you<00:04:59.610> could<00:04:59.700> use<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.940> slacker<00:05:00.330> app<00:05:00.630> per<00:05:00.990> se<00:05:01.200> to

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
you could use a slacker app per se to

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.070 
you could use a slacker app per se to
get<00:05:01.640> get<00:05:02.640> some<00:05:02.850> really<00:05:03.150> quick<00:05:03.330> tunes<00:05:03.630> but

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
get get some really quick tunes but

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.890 
get get some really quick tunes but
that's<00:05:04.290> not<00:05:04.920> that<00:05:05.310> big<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.730> test<00:05:05.940> because<00:05:06.390> 3g

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
that's not that big of a test because 3g

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.080 
that's not that big of a test because 3g
does<00:05:07.140> that<00:05:07.350> fairly<00:05:07.770> well<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.550> let's<00:05:08.760> check<00:05:08.970> out

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
does that fairly well so let's check out

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.870 
does that fairly well so let's check out
