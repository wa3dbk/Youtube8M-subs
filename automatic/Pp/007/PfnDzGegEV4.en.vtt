00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 And then I'll show you one more 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.920
 clamor here is now a power of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.140
 that volcanic explosion that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.570
 he does it with two fingers 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.980
 we want both of them up to the only one 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 You were in everything. 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.180
 and the files 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.690
 clÃ©o the files inside the three gta 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.809
 that mg and that fp and that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 especially the file that is in the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.300
 pasta molds a paste tx of without it to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.550
 game mode folder does not work 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.019
 have to add everything replace everything 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 we ask the region where at the time and to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.770
 start there when you activate 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.299
 appears v said along with the tip 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.930
 Green is just to help out there. 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.200
 stay cool the video the game and animation and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.320
 it will always appear edits upside down 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.340
 to the north of the map the north is this side 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.680
 that is counting now on the screen 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.990
 if I know when I write the name 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.960
 na to see that practice the code you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.689
 write there on the cover see you go 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 tighten the air key cnj he will turn 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.869
 left side then keep facing the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.329
 I think the west this side here for this 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.759
 side when you retire and turn to the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.280
 North side 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.460
 then let's write cooperative too 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.460
 will come with cj show does not occur with 11 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.610
 of these vehicles 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:13.430
 here fire writes on the cover see active on 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:15.650
 expected to do so this is up to this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.050
 planet is not bad at all 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.459
 I think I should greet the beings. 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.459
 noisy and curious do not overdo it 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.510
 just do not press anything when you activate 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.030
 the animation goes on and on and on 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.010
 normal you control the visit is a 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.590
 gang member there you can call him 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:43.519
 for your gang to be either makes or leaves 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.470
 If he dies, you have to start the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.310
 game has a look and does not know game 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 could appear again if you type the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.260
 code it in turn was already maintain 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.750
 distance from some vehicles to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.090
 blasts do not catch you will get the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.310
 edit probably will die in 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.100
 an explosion in a vehicle near him already 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.730
 so let's go 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.150
 to activate the explosion is nappa 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.700
 Vulcano you hold the alt key and 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:20.170
 press the number 1 key on top of the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.170
 letter that same as out number 1 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:43.030
 the silver itself I think I could have 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.030
 been kinder but it was unintentionally 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:53.240
 is there great power 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.800
 he got half the hand he 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.449
 raises much the woman had a 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.599
 cause of video recording here 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.280
 initials that I kind of left 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.520
 out of sync, but good to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.349
 You'll see yours is going to stay sharp. 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:20.419
 you can invoke the edits that let you try 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:21.980
 The Milan is off in that galera. 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.490
 beauty 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.490
 to mexico 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.050
 So 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:37.270
 who only want to download the blog around me 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.270
 I did it there. 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.270
 then this is the land 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.370
 this planet is not bad at all 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:09.780
 I think I should greet the fires. 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.780
 for 85 curious do not overdo it 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.410
 the pope thinks I could have been more 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.410
 gentle but it was unintentionally
