00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
which is probably better earned actually

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
that sits in front of you that only you

that sits in front of you that only you
can<00:02:40.220> move<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.940> also<00:02:41.330> causes<00:02:41.540> damage<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.170> any

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.470 
can move that also causes damage to any
enemies<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.220> contacts<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:44.060> well<00:02:44.120> as

causing<00:02:44.690> knock<00:02:45.080> back<00:02:45.349> these<00:02:45.890> are<00:02:46.069> some<00:02:46.190> really

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
causing knock back these are some really

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.949 
causing knock back these are some really
interesting<00:02:46.610> properties<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> move<00:02:47.750> that

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
interesting properties to the move that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.140 
interesting properties to the move that
I<00:02:47.989> figured<00:02:48.319> could<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.650> abused<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.160> some<00:02:49.400> way<00:02:49.580> so

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
I figured could be abused in some way so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.520 
I figured could be abused in some way so
I<00:02:50.180> tested<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.690> barrier<00:02:50.959> out<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.349> gate

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
I tested the barrier out on the gate

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.530 
I tested the barrier out on the gate
guards<00:02:51.860> who<00:02:52.010> are<00:02:52.099> stationary<00:02:52.610> enemies<00:02:53.030> since

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
guards who are stationary enemies since

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.089 
guards who are stationary enemies since
the<00:02:53.720> gate<00:02:53.870> guards<00:02:54.110> can't<00:02:54.319> be<00:02:54.410> moved<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.800> figured

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
the gate guards can't be moved I figured

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.680 
the gate guards can't be moved I figured
that<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.310> barrier<00:02:55.610> would<00:02:55.790> cause<00:02:56.030> constant

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
that the barrier would cause constant

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.570 
that the barrier would cause constant
damage<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:59.170> was<00:03:00.170> correct<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.920> decided<00:03:01.250> well

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
damage I was correct so I decided well

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.670 
damage I was correct so I decided well
what<00:03:02.239> if<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.600> trap<00:03:02.810> other<00:03:03.049> enemies<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
what if I can trap other enemies in a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.770 
what if I can trap other enemies in a
situation<00:03:03.860> in<00:03:04.340> which<00:03:04.370> they<00:03:04.910> also<00:03:05.120> can't<00:03:05.600> move

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
situation in which they also can't move

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.410 
situation in which they also can't move
and<00:03:05.959> by<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.739> mean<00:03:06.799> can<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.880> destroy<00:03:08.090> the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and by this I mean can I destroy the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.020 
and by this I mean can I destroy the
game<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.840> break<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.319> boss<00:03:09.470> fights<00:03:09.769> with<00:03:10.040> this

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:26.230 

the<00:03:14.030> answer<00:03:14.360> was<00:03:14.720> yes

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:34.180 

die<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:27.320> all<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.500> care

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.570 

it's<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:35.120> easy<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:39.590> character<00:03:40.040> also<00:03:40.220> has<00:03:40.550> a

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
it's that easy this character also has a

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.370 
it's that easy this character also has a
move<00:03:40.850> where<00:03:41.000> he<00:03:41.030> deploys<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> decoy<00:03:41.960> that<00:03:42.170> both

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
move where he deploys a decoy that both

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.860 
move where he deploys a decoy that both
regular<00:03:42.620> enemies<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.400> bosses<00:03:43.820> will<00:03:44.300> focus<00:03:44.570> on

regular enemies and bosses will focus on

regular enemies and bosses will focus on

walk into any corner throw up a decoy

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.280 
walk into any corner throw up a decoy
and<00:03:49.700> then<00:03:50.090> while<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.360> boss<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.570> fighting<00:03:51.200> the

that<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:55.070> works<00:03:55.370> almost<00:03:55.910> every<00:03:56.210> time<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.720> when

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
that it works almost every time and when

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.840 
that it works almost every time and when
the<00:03:57.230> barrier<00:03:57.530> levels<00:03:57.920> up<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:58.220> can<00:03:58.340> deploy<00:03:58.550> two

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
the barrier levels up you can deploy two

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.850 
the barrier levels up you can deploy two
of<00:03:59.000> them<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.420> just<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.870> know<00:03:59.900> keep<00:04:00.290> throwing

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
of them and just you know keep throwing

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.290 
of them and just you know keep throwing
up<00:04:00.980> barriers<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.580> keeping<00:04:01.880> them<00:04:01.970> trapped

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
up barriers and keeping them trapped

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.750 
up barriers and keeping them trapped
until<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.720> whittles<00:04:02.990> them<00:04:03.200> down<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:04.370> really

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
until it whittles them down it really

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.720 
until it whittles them down it really
breaks<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.360> game<00:04:06.370> he<00:04:07.370> has<00:04:07.460> a<00:04:07.490> lot<00:04:07.700> of

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
breaks the game he has a lot of

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.430 
breaks the game he has a lot of
ridiculous<00:04:08.300> options<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:08.990> it<00:04:09.050> makes<00:04:09.200> him<00:04:09.350> a

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
ridiculous options and it makes him a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.290 
ridiculous options and it makes him a
game-breaking<00:04:09.830> character<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:10.940> think<00:04:11.210> it

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
game-breaking character but I think it

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.030 
game-breaking character but I think it
just<00:04:11.330> makes<00:04:11.510> him<00:04:11.720> really<00:04:11.870> fun<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.230> use<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.740> mean

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
just makes him really fun to use I mean

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.120 
just makes him really fun to use I mean
who<00:04:13.340> takes<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.670> game<00:04:13.700> like<00:04:13.940> this<00:04:14.030> seriously

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.350

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
also he has a heat ray this game is

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.200 
also he has a heat ray this game is
incredibly<00:04:23.510> open<00:04:24.290> terribly<00:04:25.130> silly<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.760> full

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
incredibly open terribly silly and full

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.820 
incredibly open terribly silly and full
of<00:04:26.240> details<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.020> generally<00:04:27.530> wouldn't

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
of details that I generally wouldn't

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.420 
of details that I generally wouldn't
come<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.130> expect<00:04:28.520> in<00:04:28.730> a<00:04:28.820> game<00:04:29.000> like<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.240> I
