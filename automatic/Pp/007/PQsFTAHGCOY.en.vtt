00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
park neutral as you can see on the shift

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.139 
park neutral as you can see on the shift
pattern<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> could<00:00:34.980> block<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
pattern here see if I could block the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.220 
pattern here see if I could block the
Sun<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> little<00:00:36.719> bit<00:00:37.100> there<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:39.170> this<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Sun a little bit there we go this is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
Sun a little bit there we go this is
neutral<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.100> between<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:42.059> two

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
neutral right here between the two

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
neutral right here between the two
ratios<00:00:42.710> then<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> had<00:00:44.600> par<00:00:45.649> yep<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
ratios then you had par yep there it is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.850 
ratios then you had par yep there it is
mark<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.969> b<00:00:48.420> c<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.809> d<00:00:50.989> park<00:00:51.989> pulled<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> way

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
mark a b c and d park pulled all the way

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
mark a b c and d park pulled all the way
back<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> neutral<00:00:54.360> though<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
back this has to be a neutral though to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
back this has to be a neutral though to
even<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.829> park<00:00:57.350> okay<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.940> this

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
even put this in park okay so this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
even put this in park okay so this
button<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.570> give<00:01:01.559> her<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> shot<00:01:01.920> i<00:01:01.980> eat<00:01:02.190> there

on a cold morning okay turn the key
assuming<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.340> park<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> good

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
assuming that it's in park all that good

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
assuming that it's in park all that good
stuff<00:01:09.320> it's<00:01:10.320> always<00:01:10.830> good<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> step<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
stuff it's always good to step on the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.660 
stuff it's always good to step on the
clutch<00:01:12.270> anyway<00:01:13.049> which<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.159> obviously

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
clutch anyway which is the one obviously

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.980 
clutch anyway which is the one obviously
all<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.090> left<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.900> your

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
all the way left and then you have your

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
all the way left and then you have your
two<00:01:16.560> individual<00:01:16.979> wheel<00:01:17.130> brakes<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
two individual wheel brakes here and you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.010 
two individual wheel brakes here and you
have<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.950> rear<00:01:19.950> lock<00:01:20.600> differential<00:01:21.600> lock<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
have a rear lock differential lock and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
have a rear lock differential lock and
when<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.229> hit<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> brakes<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.920> nice<00:01:23.130> -<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
when you hit the brakes it's nice - it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
when you hit the brakes it's nice - it
unlocks<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.240> by<00:01:24.900> international<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.799> do

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
unlocks it by international doesn't do

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
unlocks it by international doesn't do
that<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.280> end<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.549> almost<00:01:27.060> hitting<00:01:27.689> things

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that so i end up almost hitting things

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.999 
that so i end up almost hitting things
um<00:01:29.119> because<00:01:30.119> it'll<00:01:30.420> start<00:01:30.659> plowing<00:01:31.110> forward

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
um because it'll start plowing forward

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.539 
um because it'll start plowing forward
all<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.090> anyway<00:01:33.240> turn<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> gate

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
all right so anyway turn the gate

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
all right so anyway turn the gate
there<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> nice<00:01:37.380> puff<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.770> smoke

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
there we go get that nice puff of smoke

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.170 
there we go get that nice puff of smoke
out<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.399> there<00:01:40.070> now<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> actually<00:01:41.520> turn<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.030> off

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
out of there now I actually turn it off

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
out of there now I actually turn it off
right<00:01:42.420> before<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.930> video<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> already

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
right before this video but it already

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
right before this video but it already
is<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.790> warmed<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:48.350> normally<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is a little warmed up so normally you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.370 
is a little warmed up so normally you
would<00:01:49.619> let<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> warm<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.110> bit

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
would let it warm up for a little bit

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
would let it warm up for a little bit
just<00:01:52.530> yeah<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.920> good<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.720> everything's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
just yeah it's good for it everything's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.050 
just yeah it's good for it everything's
blowing<00:01:56.240> seatbelts<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:58.289> that<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.710> has<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
blowing seatbelts on not that it has a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.130 
blowing seatbelts on not that it has a
safety<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.539> or<00:02:00.689> anything

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
safety for that or anything

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.380 
safety for that or anything
anyway<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:03.179> throttle<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.990> one

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.130 

reasons<00:02:09.390> model<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:10.590> thing<00:02:10.860> before<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.299> move

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
reasons model one thing before you move

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.410 
reasons model one thing before you move
that<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:13.860> should<00:02:14.069> check<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.610> an

ratio<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:34.200> got<00:02:34.349> your<00:02:34.500> speed<00:02:34.799> laid<00:02:35.099> out<00:02:35.280> all

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
ratio you got your speed laid out all

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.890 
ratio you got your speed laid out all
there<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.030> different<00:02:36.209> healers<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.720> all<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
reversed you can shift while moving

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.860 
reversed you can shift while moving
under<00:03:15.750> two<00:03:15.989> circumstances<00:03:16.170> once<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.750> turn<00:03:18.750> my

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
under two circumstances once I turn my
