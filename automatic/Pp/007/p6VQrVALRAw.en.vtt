00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.450
 every morning when we wake up I 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:18.439
 think I will save genre 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.439
 and the more I will make myself 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.730
 it's only a matter of time 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.320
 before meeting one that is too much 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 powerful 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.439
 so that I can beat him hi to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.359
 all and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 a review on the amazing spider man 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.160
 2 or rather now amazing spider 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.600
 man the fate of a hero but more 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 precisely on the trailer that is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 released on December 5, 2013 so why 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 a trailer will tell me well 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.550
 simply because it's my 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 first video and I wanted to mark the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.460
 shot and he saw the trailer is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.710
 released not so long ago 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 So here we are, but good after my next 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 criticism will focus on movies when 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.710
 that you will not go out I'll go see him and I 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.500
 you would say my feeling what I have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.399
 thought of this film the positive sides and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.399
 negative side 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.329
 that's first of all what we 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.339
 strikes the most in this trailer 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.640
 and see the new spa suit 10 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.350
 in action that the costume is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.759
 brings the comics a lot closer with momentum 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.509
 who are rounded but hey it's not 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.160
 at all bad thing 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.690
 it's very good because the cat 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.880
 the wine get a lot closer to the comics 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.729
 with the system sound of own canvas 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.899
 that it was he who did it so 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.039
 this is not bad at all 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.100
 it's very good to have 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.360
 continued its what we also see in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.819
 this trailer is the new 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.619
 main villain of this movie 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:36.300
 elektro kif and by jamie foxx a very 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.160
 good actor there is also harry who's coming 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.489
 harry osborn who is played by dan 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.280
 fans 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:46.140
 the guy from chronicle is also laurino 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 but I do not know by whom I have a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.229
 throne and I do not know anymore by he's 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.050
 played I'm sorry frankly I do not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.959
 know more that's what will we do in this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 film finally for me why the serious 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.110
 who did I find that there is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.619
 serious in rendering in the balance of 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.520
 to see a little thing that makes you smile but 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.850
 I think it's a lot more 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.619
 serious 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.819
 marc webb the betty who wanted to 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.890
 loose and already you want but to peter 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.220
 parker at war and life rumors about 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.950
 that but yes life says he was going 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 zoom in and spider man 2 a little 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.510
 more funny jacques the summer in semmar 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.620
 funny enough but more fun and I have 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 the print in this trailer 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.360
 well then the call has not kept it 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.340
 had said it's a real sense it's a 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 little blacker by the tutor but it's 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.060
 I do not know how you explain that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.360
 it's more action less stuff 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.620
 are finally laughing really felt 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.209
 people she had seen videos or sent 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.010
 this Tuesday with a fire helmet in 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.690
 put out a fire I believe with 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.220
 a fire hose and that's well I 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.480
 do not know I think I'm here we did it 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.910
 not seen precisely that's what amazed me 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.890
 I thought we would finally see her 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.170
 In short, I feel that this band 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.620
 announcement finally rather this movie is going to be a 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.329
 little more a little I do not know how 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.819
 explain it a little more serious than 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.799
 that the other 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.139
 for like the trailer the audi in 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.999
 this movie we will surely find 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.129
 information on the death of 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.650
 peter's parents because in fact this is 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.659
 a little bit at the same time of the purpose of the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.159
 movie too it's not that spiderman 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.269
 who opposes pop there is a villain because he 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.870
 was the case it is not a prison 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.609
 it's good no it's also what in me 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.639
 the more it is to know what happened 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.639
 on the death of parents peter therefore 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.079
 here I forgot to tell you we have 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.730
 as well the new villain of a 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.290
 new villain it's going to be the jester 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.200
 green 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.629
 I think that new movement avatar 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 y'as bourdin frankly finally here it is 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.090
 is a little super saiyan mode with its 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.139
 hair but good good then to the potty 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.639
 concludes and this little criticism 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.829
 I think the film is going to be frankly 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.169
 intense already it prepares us a little 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.810
 because the 3 and the 4 marc webb and sony 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.510
 have leaked out that's going to be a bit of a 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.129
 two-part fight a part loan 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.510
 against the teen star 6 may be 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.669
 helped by the pussy or we do not know too much 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.169
 frankly it's a bit like that sony 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.159
 and marco bin and they say a little what 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.079
 what are they going to do before 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.729
 to have seen the movie 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.780
 so we do not really know it's still 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.430
 a little vague what will happen 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.079
 normally meridian should appear 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.239
 in a house spider man the destiny 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.530
 of a heroes not allies there was cut off at 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.720
 mounting 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.050
 maybe appears in the 3 so that's it 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.130
 it's a little vague anyway so you 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.169
 meaning that we could see with the band 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.900
 announcement with everything that breaks everywhere 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.880
 spider man it's clear is going to have bread 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.330
 on the board between electro the buffoon 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.880
 green and the rhino I think that's going to be 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.470
 a little bit of a bit of bread on the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.600
 board 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.070
 the pad avengers nothing at all you'll 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.200
 must dismount alone this country so 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.380
 that I think that yeah that can be a 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.820
 pretty intense film 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.020
 I hope and I think from what we have 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.090
 seen better than the 2 in terms of 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.030
 history because the second one a forgiveness 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.310
 was done by the so-called wave even though 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.530
 It's a very good film 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.120
 for my part I really liked 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.770
 all know that the trailer has been 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.200
 done before the movie because this is 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.780
 precisely had evidence with them of 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.700
 money loans finally short 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.720
 so that's it but also no I think 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.550
 wade will still be in term 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.729
 of action his life is going to be at the top by 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.000
 compared to spiderman the same relative 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.560
 with spinach man from sam raimi 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.700
 finally we'll see it's still a little fuzzy 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.470
 wait for the other two bands 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.600
 ads that will get there they opted 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.680
 excerpts we'll see but otherwise I 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.220
 think me it can be my announcement 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.550
 quite enough quite intense flocks with 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.729
 good choice of bad guys good choice of 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.930
 two costumes new costumes 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.450
 yeah i think yeah that 's gonna be 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.310
 a good finish so that's if you liked 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.690
 these critics 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.250
 put a little I like if you are 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.600
 aware of all the next 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.510
 criticism that I do subscribe to the 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.630
 chain and now to call them all 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.630
 world 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.080
 you 're not fucking size 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.680
 I made a choice it's my destiny 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.910
 everyone in this movie 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.630
 what it is to live in a world 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.630
 without energy 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.219
 without mercy 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.449
 esso spider man 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.770
 here
