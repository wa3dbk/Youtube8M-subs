grassy lake and pomme de terre and it

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.909 
grassy lake and pomme de terre and it
seemed<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.960> have<00:04:53.110> really<00:04:53.380> good<00:04:53.500> bear<00:04:53.710> habitat

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
seemed to have really good bear habitat

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.909 
seemed to have really good bear habitat
but<00:04:54.490> few<00:04:54.790> if<00:04:55.000> any<00:04:55.150> bears<00:04:55.510> so<00:04:56.260> we<00:04:56.410> began<00:04:56.680> moving

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
but few if any bears so we began moving

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.520 
but few if any bears so we began moving
bears<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.490> 2001<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:59.200> far<00:04:59.440> we've<00:04:59.710> moved

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
bears in 2001 and so far we've moved

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.440 
bears in 2001 and so far we've moved
40-46<00:05:02.530> females<00:05:03.040> with<00:05:03.340> almost<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.820> hundred<00:05:03.970> Cubs

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
40-46 females with almost a hundred Cubs

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.690 
40-46 females with almost a hundred Cubs
this<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.440> going<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.650> be<00:05:05.770> our<00:05:05.889> last<00:05:06.100> year<00:05:06.520> we

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
this is going to be our last year we

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.730 
this is going to be our last year we
feel<00:05:06.910> like<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.270> population<00:05:07.930> is<00:05:08.110> sustainable

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
feel like that population is sustainable

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.700 
feel like that population is sustainable
now<00:05:08.950> they've<00:05:09.820> had<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.510> number<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.930> litters<00:05:11.470> down

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
now they've had a number of litters down

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.890 
now they've had a number of litters down
there<00:05:11.950> i<00:05:11.979> think<00:05:12.280> they<00:05:12.430> totaled<00:05:12.820> 20<00:05:13.030> now<00:05:13.419> within

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
there i think they totaled 20 now within

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.590 
there i think they totaled 20 now within
the<00:05:14.020> pet<00:05:14.200> starting<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.680> 2005<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:16.419> that

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
the pet starting in 2005 so that

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.840 
the pet starting in 2005 so that
population<00:05:17.289> can<00:05:17.500> now<00:05:17.650> sustain<00:05:18.160> itself<00:05:18.550> that

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
population can now sustain itself that

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.490 
population can now sustain itself that

we'll<00:05:51.580> have<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.789> female<00:05:52.090> abandoned<00:05:52.780> her<00:05:52.900> cub

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
we'll have a female abandoned her cub

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.560 
we'll have a female abandoned her cub
because<00:05:54.190> we're<00:05:54.340> monitoring<00:05:54.820> them<00:05:55.060> so<00:05:55.240> closely

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
because we're monitoring them so closely

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.050 
because we're monitoring them so closely
we'll<00:05:56.320> go<00:05:56.470> in<00:05:56.650> and<00:05:56.770> pick<00:05:56.919> those<00:05:57.160> Cubs<00:05:57.490> up<00:05:57.789> and

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
we'll go in and pick those Cubs up and

we'll go in and pick those Cubs up and
will<00:05:58.210> foster<00:05:58.479> them<00:05:58.870> to<00:05:59.080> another<00:05:59.320> female<00:05:59.620> and<00:06:00.010> a

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
will foster them to another female and a

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.570 
will foster them to another female and a
den<00:06:00.280> so<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.669> we<00:06:00.760> don't<00:06:00.910> lose<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.330> Cubs
