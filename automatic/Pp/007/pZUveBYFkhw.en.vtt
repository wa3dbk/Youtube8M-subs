00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi friends, good friends today I want 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.760
 repeat a video because I already have a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.860
 uploaded video on how to do the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.150
 paella tricks paella but 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.320
 I mean 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.500
 I go to a point that is the point d 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.590
 good for parts let's go I'll go I'll 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.090
 parts first repeat video 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.710
 because the other before that the one that I have in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.309
 the uploaded sight not seen very well 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.670
 is a little bit wrong it turns out that from 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.899
 what 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.429
 that what I 'm going is that a lot of people 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.339
 Paella can do very well 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:45.720
 paella but it turns out that they say good 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:48.540
 I make the paella but when I get to 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.620
 when the time came when I made the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.780
 water has made the broth not because I already 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.120
 it spoils the paella breaks down and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.050
 it spoils me 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.699
 well I always said it was said that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.350
 under no circumstances touch the paella 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.350
 when the rice is cooking 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.390
 and well, I'm decrying it 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.460
 because I move the rice 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.460
 I remove it removes them again 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.370
 because because to me personally to me 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.130
 then to me the rice 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.810
 it cooks on one side even if I put it 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.090
 the biggest stove is baked by a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.550
 side but on the other side 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.670
 I'm left raw 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.140
 well one of two or I'm going around 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.500
 to the size continuously that was left 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.880
 dizzy because it's about 20 minutes that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.980
 the rice is cooked depends on the type of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 rice or 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.050
 I 'm looking like one side of me 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.330
 burning today and the other is left me I turn 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.060
 So what do I do? 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.180
 I do remove it, it's worth it and I get a 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 rice a super rice not super what 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.150
 it follows that it happens that it's not that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.410
 tell me is that I have been many years 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.990
 making paella and good many people 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.990
 He told me then that he is 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.020
 delicious that is delicious and in fact 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.660
 is that I get very very very very good what 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.510
 that is when you do not have to move the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.010
 rice when when the moment 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.200
 plans we plug in at the moment in which 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.120
 We put out the fire when when we turn off 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.520
 the stove then yes you have to leave 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.920
 well well calm and well tranquilito 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.150
 the arrocito then when we during 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.290
 about 5 or 6 minutes it is tranquilized and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.420
 so 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.700
 it's delicious, it stays 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.859
 resting and resting and 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.960
 then the rice is really 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:59.140
 really delicious let's go 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.940
 what's better the kind of rice a lot 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.680
 people say good what kind of rice made 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.270
 Well, I usually do a lot of people and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.830
 usually in the paella is usually cast 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.980
 rice 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.760
 fat rice round rice is worth 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 but if you or someone you like more 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.360
 long then look at the long rice but 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.170
 Normally the round rice is poured 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.730
 another thing that I do not forget 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.330
 the onion the onion if we miss a lot 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.670
 sole usually leave the pasty rice 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.510
 so what happens then better not to throw 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.510
 onion to throw a lot more down much garlic 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.150
 well minced well minced when we go 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.000
 throwing the ingredients we put on fire 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.240
 very slow to very slow fire always 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.500
 make the sofrito on fire very very very very 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 slow and you'll see how a sauce comes out 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.370
 impeccable great then take the 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.030
 stirred over low heat and always covered 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.100
 so that everything goes by chando 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.020
 ponchando betting digital is delicious 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.550
 that we like garlic can be less 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.560
 take less quantity of onion is worth and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.209
 then the ingredients is yours 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.470
 choice that is vegetarian then 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.269

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.770
 that you liked fish 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.770

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.900
 I have done the I am stirring when 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.710
 I throw the rice in the broth in the paella and 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.169
 the broth is removed at high heat 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.910
 at medium heat or cause never to fire 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.440

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.889
 I am stirring stirring 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.780
 and until I try it I'll try it 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.050
 because you have to taste the food that 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.889

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.760
