00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.740 
want to heal and what Camera Raw has
done<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.560> set<00:01:56.890> down<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.400> green<00:01:58.060> dot<00:01:58.360> to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
done is it set down a green dot to

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200 
done is it set down a green dot to
sample<00:01:59.470> from<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.610> it's<00:02:00.820> taking<00:02:01.180> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
sample from so it's taking the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.789 
sample from so it's taking the
information<00:02:01.390> that's<00:02:01.960> under<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.320> green<00:02:02.530> dot

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
information that's under the green dot

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.950 
information that's under the green dot
and<00:02:02.950> it's<00:02:03.430> moving<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.880> over<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.659> area

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
and it's moving it over to the area

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.260 
and it's moving it over to the area
under<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.409> red<00:02:05.590> dot<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.010> it's<00:02:06.549> seamlessly

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
under the red dot and it's seamlessly

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.199 
under the red dot and it's seamlessly
healing<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.900> for<00:02:08.110> me<00:02:08.259> now<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:09.310> can<00:02:09.580> change<00:02:09.879> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
healing it for me now we can change the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.600 
healing it for me now we can change the
size<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.869> these<00:02:11.170> dots<00:02:11.409> by<00:02:11.980> simply<00:02:12.370> clicking

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
size of these dots by simply clicking

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.360 
size of these dots by simply clicking
and<00:02:13.000> dragging<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.810> really<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.769> want<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> make

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and dragging and really you want to make

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.179 
and dragging and really you want to make
the<00:02:15.549> smallest<00:02:16.090> size<00:02:16.299> dot<00:02:16.599> possible<00:02:17.230> when<00:02:18.159> I

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
the smallest size dot possible when I

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.489 
the smallest size dot possible when I
position<00:02:18.639> my<00:02:18.730> cursor<00:02:18.760> inside<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.900> dot<00:02:20.049> you'll

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.499 
position my cursor inside the dot you'll

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.429 
position my cursor inside the dot you'll
notice<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:20.889> can<00:02:21.040> also<00:02:21.249> move<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.200> let's

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
notice I can also move this so let's

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.059 
notice I can also move this so let's
make<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.769> just

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
make it just

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.250 
make it just
we<00:02:24.280> bit<00:02:24.549> larger<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.239> want<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.599> make<00:02:25.689> sure<00:02:25.719> it's<00:02:26.019> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
we bit larger I want to make sure it's a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.830 
we bit larger I want to make sure it's a
little<00:02:26.920> bit<00:02:27.219> larger<00:02:27.579> than<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> area<00:02:28.389> that<00:02:28.719> I'm

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
little bit larger than the area that I'm

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.280 
little bit larger than the area that I'm
trying<00:02:29.139> to<00:02:29.200> cover<00:02:29.499> and<00:02:29.859> then<00:02:30.790> we<00:02:31.629> can<00:02:31.780> tap<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
trying to cover and then we can tap the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.929 
trying to cover and then we can tap the
V<00:02:32.560> key<00:02:32.889> to<00:02:33.189> hide<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.879> show<00:02:34.599> that<00:02:34.930> overlay<00:02:35.939> so

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
V key to hide and show that overlay so

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.520 
V key to hide and show that overlay so
now<00:02:37.090> let's<00:02:37.359> move<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.959> dot<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.469> here
