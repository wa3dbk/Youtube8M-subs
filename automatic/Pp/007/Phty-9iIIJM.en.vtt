 oh came the fire brigade arrived 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.080
 fire calculation that he did smooth 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.120
 the score did nothing like water 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.930

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.640
 ended in two minutes i cook that what 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.800
 someone else will come next 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.030
 but we will go for water they left for water 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.890
 the house is burning blazing 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.170
 already lit up a couple side of the house then 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.850
 there is at first one up 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.420
 was still to save up local 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.489
 burning somehow put out something then when they 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.230
 left us all completely left just 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.970
 there were people at home was to come 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.299
 don't fall because there was a huge 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.519
 the house is a two-story it turns his mind to 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.590
 time already paid down the fire already everything 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.840
 I paid one, that is, there is already exactly the bill 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.060
 there was nothing to put out along with it 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.950
 that person turns out to wake up 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.870
 firemen he called through his acquaintances 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.319
 there through the precinct called the neighboring 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.730
 villages 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.190
 demon two cars we have a row 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.739
 called stich on 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.540
 from there from there or signaling the fact that 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.269
 general this village is that machine 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.510
 arrived faster than ours arrived 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.549
 our local car that drove away 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.950
 will fill up, that is, come as well, and start 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.269
 fully stew stew has all been 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.799
 don't you drag us yet 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.079
 then came the walls two more cars oh but 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.450
 there is no sense yes further I can 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.750
 explain dad and action yes i'm a man 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.510
 I do not have anything to do with them 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.790
 fireman chest even well I you just 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.280
 adult's sides like how 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.109
 Now extinguish the fire burn imagine 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.389
 see myself to prove metal so 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.579
 that's covered there caught fire inside 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.060
 razdra began with the second floor because 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.070
 that the wiring box was there 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.410
 started the second floor 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.990
 one car diode on the roof and the other already 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.820
 beats down i mean the device throw on 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.760
 the roof when water drains for that 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.510
 done so that we just don't rain 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.200
 got it in the area 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.820
 I understood that 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.890
 something is meaningless because nothing 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.110
 It will not change, and then all fired up 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.110
 I know that everything is all about not extinguish 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.220
 therefore, in general, it turned out that 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:59.600
 it turned out and further about also 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:02.090
 the actions themselves, that is , the unit 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:08.300
 sure I can . were there soberly to this 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.970
 kearney do not bother us the basis of all 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.190
 there were people out of all this 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.990
 brigade that came originally 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.990
 only 2 people were called to the challenge 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.500
 fire hydrants as they correctly 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.910
 so these hoses are also called 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.850
 all witnesses people all stood saw what 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.040
 the water not only went but went but not full of holes 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.870
 just didn't dive and possessed just about 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.090
 so well, at least there are a lot of witnesses 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.460
 people were the goods you have there questions 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.350
 that was what the main man asked 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.220
 who shot all this video that is 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.760
 often acted firemen he he called 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.830
 parallel to the neighboring island was asking 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.570
 they did not call you to help 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.850
 there will be a home brew more down on and 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.040
 fire on make him nobody nobody 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.160
 called about and 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.860
 it would be possible to write off the fact that there 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.590
 stars so become something else in case 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.910
 so there it is but this is not this already 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.830
 half a year it's already full of 3 or 4 comfortable 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.840
 things and burned out also one store shop 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.270
 was generally there directly 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.660
 proximity there at 300 meters right in the very 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.130
 center from the fire brigade also itself 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.240
 came no water went to look for water 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.800
 found one came to put out 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.680
 accordingly, nothing is the same 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.830
 at home, people also said the situation of the 1st 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.979
 no repeated fireman arrives at 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.290
 water is poured two minutes for as long as 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.139
 hose just with a simple barrier sore 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.440
 all over the water we left all 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:50.060
 went into the house please let us burn 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:53.350
 We will do everything that we answer like this 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.620
 It turned out and already when they changed and did not give 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.919
 turns into a fire in about 315 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.740
 started 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.430
 and finished stewing around nine o'clock 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.889
 am that is, it has already arrived another 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.300
 calculation is another change but the same is true 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.780
 were tucked yes already 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.990
 direction and behaved adequately 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.910
 there are norms yet nothing therefore 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.370
 starter next shift but there already 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.620
 again to put out was nothing more than easy 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:24.160
 you people went shed heads because 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.890
 that what's cool is that minus a home 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.100
 left alone walls you will complain 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:32.500
 I want to play this game with a team 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:36.130
 we're going really want going 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.840
 write in the Slavic region because 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.480
 locally I think it makes sense to write 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.060
 no, it is not why not at all lead 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.130
 it is not even a penalty 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.380
 not just so tasty nothing she 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.380
 still not be accustomed to the power of magic
