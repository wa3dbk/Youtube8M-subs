give<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:56.730> crushing<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> reason

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
give it a good crushing and the reason

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.540 
give it a good crushing and the reason
I'm<00:00:58.590> crushing<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.129> leaving<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> whole

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I'm crushing that's not leaving it whole

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.650 
I'm crushing that's not leaving it whole
is<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.090> expose<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> inside<00:01:01.129> to<00:01:02.570> whatever<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is to expose the inside to whatever is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.880 
is to expose the inside to whatever is
cooking<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
cooking so I can get the you know the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.200 
cooking so I can get the you know the
juices<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.400> inside<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:05.909> otherwise

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
juices to go inside because otherwise

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
juices to go inside because otherwise
it'll<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> seal<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> outside<00:01:07.619> I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it'll kind of seal up on the outside I'm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980 
it'll kind of seal up on the outside I'm
also<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> give<00:01:08.909> those<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.780> rough

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
also going to give those a really rough

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.160 
also going to give those a really rough
chop<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> second<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:12.990> how

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
chop here in a second you can see how

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
chop here in a second you can see how
like<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> said<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.830> crush<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.390> grab<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
like I said you just crush it grab a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.789 
like I said you just crush it grab a
little<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> end<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:15.900> paper<00:01:16.080> falls<00:01:16.590> right

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
little the end your paper falls right

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
little the end your paper falls right
out<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:18.180> almost<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.900> magic<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> do

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
out it's almost like magic you can do

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210 
out it's almost like magic you can do
multiple<00:01:21.540> pieces<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:22.049> once<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.100> sure

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
multiple pieces at once to make sure

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
multiple pieces at once to make sure
they're<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> same<00:01:23.880> size<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they're about the same size that's the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
they're about the same size that's the
only<00:01:24.960> real<00:01:25.110> criteria<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.939> they're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
only real criteria because if they're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.179 
only real criteria because if they're
not<00:01:27.180> they<00:01:27.479> won't<00:01:27.659> crush<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.710> maybe<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> bigger

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
not they won't crush or maybe the bigger

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
not they won't crush or maybe the bigger
piece<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.640> keep<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> smaller<00:01:30.119> piece<00:01:30.390> from

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
piece will keep the smaller piece from

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
piece will keep the smaller piece from
crushing<00:01:30.810> right<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.340> end<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.520> just

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
crushing right and then you end up just

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
crushing right and then you end up just
doing<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:32.970> twice<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:34.140> point<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
doing the work twice and that point you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.880 
doing the work twice and that point you
should<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.009> done<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.759> separately

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
should have just done them separately

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.749 
should have just done them separately
