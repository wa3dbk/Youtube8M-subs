 breakfast is very happy with you 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 welcome in this early morning today 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 it's not a usual breakfast 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 finds himself for a potter post it's up to 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 tell your subscriber receptions and that's me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.480
 always very happy to see the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 little gifts you offer me 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 from time to time it often goes to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 through the letters of my darling 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.330
 pascal we receive tons and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 tons and in general you thought of me 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.940
 at the same time 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.079
 and it really touches me a lot in that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.360
 this is a very small attention a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.800
 drawing a map or a booster at each 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.780
 times thanks to you and in the cumulated years 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.550
 I can make a good little video of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.870
 poker paston morning and today I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.090
 proposes that we look at each other together 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 what you offered me these last 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.850
 days I can not wait to watch I'm 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.170
 as a little child the joy of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 small cards ultra rare a small 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.649
 booster I'm sure we can be done 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 pleasure and I propose maps and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.989
 all that and do things in 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.300
 order 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 so first the orange sleeve we 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 comes from Antonin so apparently he 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.219
 would have offered me a map machir he me 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 said that apparently it would be for the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.250
 dedication and then I do not know it 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 would you have to confirm that in the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.930
 comments we will see the map that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.670
 it is necessarily a small camino the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 fire calls the fire good I'm going to stop 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.159
 to say that because right now I 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.850
 say a lot with me make an armful 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.170
 galli 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.400
 in any case the map is very very beautiful 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.299
 it's a pebble what is this series 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.130
 supreme winner 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.750
 oh yeah yeah anyway she's beautiful 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.770
 she is really nice I like that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.689
 the nuptials and to tell the truth I 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 not even know you see actually 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 and makes a lot of sense for me 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.880
 frankly she is very beautiful and if 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.840
 it's for a dedication m'dit far in 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 comments and it is with pleasure 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.750
 that I will make you a good then we pass 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 anais and her little brother who 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.380
 offered quite a lot already there is the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 little brother I think of the analyzes I 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220
 do not know how to reduce it I know it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.079
 comes from both a canino drawing if he 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 was completely done by hand it gets 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.619
 saw frankly bravo I do not even know 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.780
 not if I would be able to draw 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.090
 that it is super cute that finds it 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.649
 very original it lacks a little bit of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.030
 color with a little more orange 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.200
 it would have been perfect but here I am 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.850
 tease do not worry she's 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.740
 really nice frankly it makes me 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.579
 very nice we have a special breakfast 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 khenin rise today 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.960
 then we have that yes there was 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.000
 then a little pouch with a ball 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.830
 I see above a casino of the basic set 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.330
 but then I do not even know how I 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.340
 I'm going out so much that looks to me 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.390
 burying machin I have the impression that 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.360
 it's impossible to go out I do not want 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.920
 to break everything but hey we'll try and 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.230
 Scotch to see myself look at me to what 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.150
 point galley then we will try 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.250
 to be doing plastic art 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.590
 today it's like in college we're going 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.140
 to do but it's not possible what's it 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.240
 all that the patient then do it 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.200
 plastic arts here I managed to 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.520
 to reach the cards 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.400
 so was there just one or 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840
 several yona d2 so you see where 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.180
 I managed bullets and that was 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.500
 incredible so what do we have time 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.760
 have a piece of tape on the finger 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.610
 it's the little piece that does not happen to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.070
 to leave we have a case linos 17 basic 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.410
 necessarily and then why not 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.670
 in steel water of emerging power the one 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.390
 I had not been there for a long time 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.340
 seen this map 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.530
 what can i not have it noah 6 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.390
 in dog strategy I do not like 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.430
 any fan the pokémon and still here in itself 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.600
 but in bath strategy for my team 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.580
 it's a real wound actually there are some 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.590
 very big trials against steel hainaut or 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.660
 mega florise ars and the two pokémon who 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.310
 against perfectly in team and suddenly 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.110
 every time I see 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.360
 all the defeats I had against 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.800
 it's good but in any case very simple 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.269
 two little cards very nice that 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.829
 makes me happy but it's not over 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.170
 another ace and the little brothers 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.810
 offered a small boost r must be done 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.130
 1 2 3 1 2 it's the best to have a 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.540
 Boost for breakfast is really 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.140
 the little touch that makes a perfect 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.900
 breakfast 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.400
 we will see what they offered me this 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.420
 times down I could in order to tickets 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.180
 the cards so I'm going to take the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.650
 scissors will be simpler and we will see 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.980
 together neighborhoods put me in the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.720
 trap 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.660
 they told me to do the 1 2 3 1 2 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.250
 then we will do it 1 2 3 1 2 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.410
 let's go to discover 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.850
 together a kisten booster I do not know 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.010
 at all what to expect 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.269
 good so we start with a float to 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.519
 cheeks seem to be hungry because he wants 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.959
 eat apples then we have a 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.850
 vivalda a wish it's been a very long time 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.310
 that this pokemon did not see it in the tcg 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.630
 wow it goes back I think we did not 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.489
 seen since emerging power from elsewhere 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.500
 wow i'm going even more than he existed 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.860
 am there then we go on with a 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.950
 dragon 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.930
 eric notes a secateur waouh 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.220
 he is in a pose at his majestic 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.790
 there we can see the power of a 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.459
 secateur 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.039
 we continue with an energy a 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.680
 second nrj a barcamp you the pokémon 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.910
 piranhas behind the pokemon I 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.039
 always seen going on always in the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.740
 pronunciation of his name mia miasmes a 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.150
 may have done well for once 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.100
 last a pure eagles an energy 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.900
 ah and ended then I do not know if 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.950
 I did well 1 2 3 1 2 I do not know 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.960
 if there were cards better than 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.370
 others to breastfeed rivers the fact that we 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.650
 did not notice but it's not easy 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.690
 to see go to a really really rivers 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.860
 very pale does not touch himself in post a small 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.820
 age very funny and I admit that the 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.280
 best map for me and one 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.650
 secateur I think frankly go 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.180
 of hell good then the poke boss is 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.380
 almost completed there are just three 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.880
 things I failed to identify 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.740
 because I did not find the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.460
 people and it's shameful to me I'm 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.170
 Totally agree 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.640
 if you recognize yourself do not say the 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.170
 in the comments there was a 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.400
 small dab floor map so it's 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.260
 maybe plastic cards I do not know 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.700
 where are the got but necessarily 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.130
 Absolute arched the moment but pokemon 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.600

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.460

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.030
