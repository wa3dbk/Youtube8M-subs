 if you don't like your layout 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.830
 apartments or just want to change 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.240
 the situation there is no need to look for 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.250
 new housing redevelopment 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.140
 all the way down 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.240
 partitions if only they are not 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.450
 bearing walls you can do 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.210
 independently and new boundaries of pavlov 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 gained space easy 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.130
 install using partitions of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.980
 drywall 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 however, the installation rules 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.350
 drywall plates rack profile no 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.790
 theme for our beer and here we will tell about 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.809
 tom like using drywall 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.150
 avoid the need 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.629
 plaster media smooth walls and then 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 get an incredibly smooth surface 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.100
 apply on 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.559
 this we will be in a mixture with polemicists in front 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 the beginning of the work you need to check to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 the base you glue 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.269
 drywall was cleaned 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.270
 recall in the contributions of sites 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990
 dust and substances reducing separately 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.550
 for an extra guarantee of durability 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.190
 really good adyghe k 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.680
 recommend base 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.610
 acquire it 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.030
 deep penetrating polymer primer 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 and from 5 not to dry at least four hours 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.750
 for the preparation of mortar 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.670
 uses dishware from 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 stainless material dry mix 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.990
 capes of shares corresponding 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.640
 amount of cold water and stirred 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370
 until smooth 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.229
 necessary consistency without 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 lumps after three five-minute 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.920
 the aging mixture is stirred 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.450
 re next mortar mixture 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.819
 put on fox drywall 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.669
 or directly on the ground then 

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:42.159
 tourist is applied to the wall while pressing with 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.329
 using rare and light far earlier

 leads design position check 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.289
 vertical and horizontal 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.109
 level name answer as a result we get 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.849
 fairly smooth strapped turn to 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.230
 the next stage 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.820
 after installation 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.870
 drywall sheets can be 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.820
 start filling up the seams with 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.110
 using reinforcing tapes from

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.979
 wall surfaces 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.360
 we offer to use again

 putty medopolimer finish US 9 14 m or 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.930
 starting today 1 st which ones are you 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 will use it all depends 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.500

 subtle overall 5 14 m or more dollars become steps 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.940
 11 accordingly, remember that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.690
 when working with plaster mixes 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.970
 nessesary to use 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.359
 stainless material 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.739
 and that their complete cleansing of residues 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.430
 previous to do prevent 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.279
