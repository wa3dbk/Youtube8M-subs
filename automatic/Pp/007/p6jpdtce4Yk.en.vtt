00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
consider while they're tracking people

consider while they're tracking people
through<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> woods<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.920> learned<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.730> lot<00:00:47.910> during

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
through the woods I learned a lot during

through the woods I learned a lot during
the<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.110> day<00:00:49.289> course

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the one day course

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
the one day course
and<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.640> looking<00:00:50.820> forward<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> going

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and I'm really looking forward to going

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.450 
and I'm really looking forward to going
back<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> taking<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> their<00:00:53.100> tracking

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
back and taking more of their tracking

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
back and taking more of their tracking
in<00:00:53.699> survival<00:00:54.239> courses<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> hope<00:00:55.890> you

in survival courses so I hope you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.290 
in survival courses so I hope you
learned<00:00:56.129> something<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.789> hope<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> enjoy

it as much as I did Thanks some of the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
it as much as I did Thanks some of the
considerations<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.659> human<00:01:07.350> tracking<00:01:07.770> for

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
considerations of human tracking for

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.429 
considerations of human tracking for
tracking<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.700> type<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.439> missing

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
tracking that type of thing missing

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.370 
tracking that type of thing missing
person<00:01:10.860> crime<00:01:11.850> scene<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.049> look<00:01:13.200> at

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
person crime scene and as we look at

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.749 
person crime scene and as we look at
here<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.720> County<00:01:15.720> Park<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.400> an<00:01:17.400> area

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
here we have County Park and an area

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
here we have County Park and an area
that<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> person<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.630> reported<00:01:19.140> missing<00:01:19.170> from

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that a person was reported missing from

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.219 
that a person was reported missing from
and<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.600> talk<00:01:21.780> about<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and we're going to talk about some of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
and we're going to talk about some of
the<00:01:22.290> considerations<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.220> how<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.090> look<00:01:24.330> for

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the considerations of how to look for

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
the considerations of how to look for
tracks<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.680> tracks<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
tracks or to look for tracks and some of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.010 
tracks or to look for tracks and some of
the<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.150> considerations<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.900> they're

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the other considerations and they're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.929 
the other considerations and they're
tracking<00:01:28.200> exercise<00:01:28.820> one<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
tracking exercise one of the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
tracking exercise one of the
considerations<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.409> people

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
considerations here is is how people

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.160 
considerations here is is how people
move<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> scene<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.479> look<00:01:33.659> around<00:01:33.810> us

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
move from a scene if we look around us

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.590 
move from a scene if we look around us
on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> left<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.979> bounded<00:01:35.340> rostering<00:01:35.850> pretty

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
on the left for bounded rostering pretty

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.130 
on the left for bounded rostering pretty
deep<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.380> deep<00:01:37.560> water<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.659> Road<00:01:39.659> trees<00:01:39.960> on

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
deep pretty deep water and Road trees on

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
deep pretty deep water and Road trees on
either<00:01:40.259> side<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.490> across<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:42.000> have

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
either side of it we come across we have

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.719 
either side of it we come across we have
a<00:01:42.180> ball<00:01:42.689> field<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.229> some<00:01:44.159> houses<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a ball field and some houses in the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.420 
a ball field and some houses in the
background<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:46.110> slope<00:01:46.649> where

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
background and then some slope where

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219 
background and then some slope where
some<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.759> heavy<00:01:48.060> vegetation<00:01:48.750> over<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
some pretty heavy vegetation over to the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
some pretty heavy vegetation over to the
right<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.939> how

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
right here so if you think about how

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.620 
right here so if you think about how
people<00:01:51.390> move<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
people move in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.020 
people move in
in<00:01:52.900> regular<00:01:53.350> life<00:01:53.610> we've<00:01:54.610> become<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.939> very

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
in regular life we've become a very

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.679 
in regular life we've become a very
indoor<00:01:55.630> society<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.799> very<00:01:57.070> square<00:01:58.090> almost

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
indoor society in a very square almost

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.170 
indoor society in a very square almost
oriented<00:01:59.080> society<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> lot<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.369> people<00:02:00.670> will

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
oriented society so a lot of people will

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.820 
oriented society so a lot of people will
consider<00:02:01.630> when<00:02:01.869> they<00:02:01.960> get<00:02:02.110> outside<00:02:02.290> they'll

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
consider when they get outside they'll

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.289 
consider when they get outside they'll
consider<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.400> things<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.880> they're<00:02:04.000> used<00:02:04.180> to

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
consider the things that they're used to

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.960 
consider the things that they're used to
seeing<00:02:04.570> in<00:02:04.900> indoors<00:02:05.860> which<00:02:06.310> are<00:02:06.549> hallways

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
seeing in indoors which are hallways

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.770 
seeing in indoors which are hallways
rooms<00:02:07.479> windows<00:02:08.520> doorways<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:10.209> if<00:02:10.270> we<00:02:10.420> look<00:02:10.600> at

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
rooms windows doorways so if we look at

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.100 
rooms windows doorways so if we look at
this<00:02:11.230> approach<00:02:11.620> road<00:02:11.920> as<00:02:12.190> being<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.640> hallway

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
this approach road as being a hallway

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.650 
this approach road as being a hallway
they're<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.410> through<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.100> hallway<00:02:15.670> into<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
they're going through the hallway into a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.750 
they're going through the hallway into a
room<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.290> they're<00:02:17.680> essentially<00:02:18.220> two<00:02:18.459> doors

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
room and they're essentially two doors

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.390 
room and they're essentially two doors
here<00:02:19.330> from<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.110> hallway<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> first<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
here from this hallway the first is the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.059 
here from this hallway the first is the
little<00:02:22.209> narrow<00:02:22.360> point<00:02:23.080> between<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.560> tree<00:02:23.830> and

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
little narrow point between the tree and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.660 
little narrow point between the tree and
the<00:02:25.000> defense<00:02:25.660> lawn<00:02:26.319> over<00:02:26.560> here<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.550> end

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the defense lawn over here the end

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
the defense lawn over here the end
between<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.060> two<00:02:28.209> handicap<00:02:28.540> parking<00:02:28.959> areas

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
between the two handicap parking areas

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.979 
between the two handicap parking areas
there's<00:02:29.890> also<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.250> pedestrian<00:02:30.790> access<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
there's also a pedestrian access and a

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.020 
there's also a pedestrian access and a
vehicle<00:02:32.440> access<00:02:32.800> further<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.519> right<00:02:33.700> here

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
vehicle access further to the right here

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.880 
vehicle access further to the right here
so<00:02:34.600> one<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> things<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.319> want<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.500> look<00:02:35.650> at

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
so one of the things we want to look at

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.250 
so one of the things we want to look at
the<00:02:36.250> person<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.850> obviously<00:02:37.239> not<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.900> area

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the person is obviously not in this area

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.920 
the person is obviously not in this area
they<00:02:38.950> left<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.340> area<00:02:39.519> somehow<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.420> look<00:02:40.780> at

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
they left the area somehow so to look at

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.410 
they left the area somehow so to look at
places<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:41.800> could<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:42.069> left

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
places that they could have left

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.699 
places that they could have left
considering<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.569> first<00:02:43.720> doorway<00:02:44.049> over<00:02:44.380> here

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
considering the first doorway over here

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.500 
considering the first doorway over here
and<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.250> possibly<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.880> second<00:02:46.269> doorways

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and then possibly in the second doorways

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.080 
and then possibly in the second doorways
so<00:02:46.660> as<00:02:46.750> we<00:02:46.870> move<00:02:47.049> up<00:02:47.549> remember<00:02:48.549> as<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.850> as<00:02:49.060> we

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
so as we move up remember as we as we

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.430 
so as we move up remember as we as we
move<00:02:49.420> our<00:02:49.630> point<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.959> view<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.319> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
move our point of view is going to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.979 
move our point of view is going to
change<00:02:50.730> what<00:02:51.730> we<00:02:51.850> want<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.120> try<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.780> keep

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
change what we want to try to do is keep

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.930 
change what we want to try to do is keep
any<00:02:53.230> potential<00:02:53.739> tract<00:02:53.980> area<00:02:54.370> between

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
any potential tract area between

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.880 
any potential tract area between
ourselves<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.080> Sun<00:02:56.319> because<00:02:56.650> again

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
ourselves and the Sun because again

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.479 
ourselves and the Sun because again
there's<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.220> shadows<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:59.190> will<00:03:00.190> start<00:03:00.459> to

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
there's the shadows you will start to

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.350 
there's the shadows you will start to
see<00:03:00.579> some<00:03:00.730> contracts<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:04.030> finished

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
see some contracts it just finished

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.240 
see some contracts it just finished
raining<00:03:04.570> yesterday<00:03:05.110> evening<00:03:05.739> early<00:03:05.890> this

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
raining yesterday evening early this

raining yesterday evening early this
morning<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.360> ground<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.750> nice<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.170> moist

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
morning so the ground is nice and moist

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.710 
morning so the ground is nice and moist
it<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.489> appear<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:09.820> some<00:03:10.120> sediment<00:03:10.450> from

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
it would appear that some sediment from

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360 
it would appear that some sediment from
the<00:03:10.810> stream<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.320> from<00:03:11.500> earlier<00:03:11.920> flooding

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
the stream and from earlier flooding

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.479 
the stream and from earlier flooding
events<00:03:12.760> has<00:03:12.910> has<00:03:13.180> come<00:03:13.209> up<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.989> we<00:03:14.980> start<00:03:15.400> to

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
events has has come up and we start to

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.880 
events has has come up and we start to
see<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> few<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.269> few<00:03:17.109> tracks<00:03:17.380> here<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.769> the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
see a few a few tracks here on the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.340 
see a few a few tracks here on the
ground<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:19.030> at<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.450> point<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:19.959> don't<00:03:20.170> know

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
ground and at this point we don't know

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.650 
ground and at this point we don't know
which<00:03:20.560> track<00:03:20.859> belongs<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.329> missing

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
which track belongs to this the missing

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.030 
which track belongs to this the missing
subject<00:03:23.109> so<00:03:23.230> what<00:03:23.380> we're<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.650> do<00:03:23.829> is

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
subject so what we're going to do is

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.680 
subject so what we're going to do is
look<00:03:24.220> at<00:03:24.430> what<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.180> call<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.480> inventory

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
look at what we call it inventory

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.590 
look at what we call it inventory
eliminating<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.370> we'll<00:03:27.609> do<00:03:27.850> an<00:03:27.970> inventory<00:03:28.269> of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
eliminating so we'll do an inventory of

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.210 
eliminating so we'll do an inventory of
all<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.840> tracks<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.530> may<00:03:29.680> be<00:03:29.739> in<00:03:29.920> an<00:03:30.040> area

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
all the tracks that may be in an area

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.819 
all the tracks that may be in an area
from<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.269> place<00:03:31.600> last<00:03:31.870> scene<00:03:32.170> or<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.380> last<00:03:32.620> known

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
from a place last scene or a last known

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.819 
from a place last scene or a last known
point<00:03:33.630> were<00:03:34.630> inventory<00:03:35.140> those<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.590> tried<00:03:35.799> to

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
point were inventory those and tried to

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.370 
point were inventory those and tried to
match<00:03:36.190> those<00:03:36.459> with<00:03:36.760> any<00:03:37.000> known<00:03:37.239> people<00:03:37.690> so

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
match those with any known people so

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.360 
match those with any known people so
we'll<00:03:38.799> what<00:03:39.609> we<00:03:39.730> typically<00:03:40.060> will<00:03:40.299> do<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:42.070> take

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
we'll what we typically will do is take

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.190 
we'll what we typically will do is take
what<00:03:42.549> we<00:03:42.640> call<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.850> path<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.390> most<00:03:44.049> resistance

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
what we call a path of most resistance

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.430 
what we call a path of most resistance
to<00:03:45.010> avoid<00:03:45.310> adding<00:03:45.910> any<00:03:46.269> more<00:03:46.359> tracks<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.230> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
to avoid adding any more tracks to the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.030 
to avoid adding any more tracks to the
area<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.459> then<00:03:49.239> just<00:03:49.480> very<00:03:49.630> gently<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.859> lay

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
area and then just very gently to lay

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.940 
area and then just very gently to lay
down<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.630> case<00:03:52.810> popsicle<00:03:53.410> sticks<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
down in this case popsicle sticks to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.800 
down in this case popsicle sticks to
mark<00:03:56.950> what<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.250> what<00:03:57.640> we<00:03:57.760> look<00:03:57.970> as<00:03:58.150> tracks

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
mark what we what we look as tracks

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.780 
mark what we what we look as tracks
there<00:03:59.100> so<00:04:00.100> as<00:04:00.400> we<00:04:00.519> move<00:04:00.699> up

there so as we move up

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.580 
there so as we move up
again<00:04:01.939> what<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:02.299> where<00:04:02.659> we<00:04:02.689> can<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.260> what<00:04:03.469> we

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
again what we where we can see what we

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.819 
again what we where we can see what we
will<00:04:03.799> see<00:04:03.980> will<00:04:04.129> change<00:04:04.629> so<00:04:05.629> we<00:04:06.260> have<00:04:06.439> a<00:04:06.469> track

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
will see will change so we have a track

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.929 
will see will change so we have a track
there<00:04:07.099> will<00:04:07.969> typically<00:04:08.359> mark<00:04:08.719> a<00:04:08.989> track<00:04:09.650> at<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
there will typically mark a track at the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
of a track belongs to whom but we'll go

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.950 
of a track belongs to whom but we'll go
through<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.410> we'll<00:04:27.949> mark<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.280> tracks<00:04:30.639> and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
through and we'll mark the tracks and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.529 
through and we'll mark the tracks and
again<00:04:32.960> if<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.740> as<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.669> camera<00:04:35.180> moves<00:04:35.389> around

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
again if you as a camera moves around

again if you as a camera moves around
what<00:04:36.229> we<00:04:36.349> can<00:04:36.500> see<00:04:36.849> if<00:04:37.849> we<00:04:38.120> if<00:04:38.690> we<00:04:38.930> look<00:04:38.960> at<00:04:39.259> it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
what we can see if we if we look at it

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.100 
what we can see if we if we look at it
from<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.680> opposite<00:04:40.070> direction<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:41.660> shadows

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
from the opposite direction the shadows

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.830 
from the opposite direction the shadows
will<00:04:42.320> appear<00:04:42.970> less<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.180> less<00:04:44.300> than<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.599> lugs

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
will appear less and less than the lugs

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.800 
will appear less and less than the lugs
and<00:04:45.169> that<00:04:45.440> will<00:04:45.620> change<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:46.039> little<00:04:46.160> bit<00:04:46.750> one<00:04:47.750> of

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
and that will change a little bit one of

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.540 
and that will change a little bit one of
the<00:04:47.900> things<00:04:48.050> we<00:04:48.169> talked<00:04:48.410> about<00:04:48.550> previously

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
the things we talked about previously

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.909 
the things we talked about previously
about<00:04:50.180> how<00:04:50.240> important<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.960> Sun<00:04:51.169> angle<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.530> as

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
about how important the Sun angle is as

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.400 
about how important the Sun angle is as
is<00:04:52.550> for<00:04:52.910> seeing<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.270> track<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:54.169> we<00:04:54.259> have<00:04:54.380> a

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
is for seeing the track and we have a

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.570 
is for seeing the track and we have a
demonstration<00:04:54.919> here<00:04:55.160> we<00:04:55.280> call<00:04:55.460> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
demonstration here we call the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.999 
demonstration here we call the
disappearing<00:04:56.150> reappearing<00:04:56.389> track<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:57.800> as<00:04:57.919> we

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
disappearing reappearing track so as we

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
track that you might not see right now

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:26.260 
track that you might not see right now
as<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.729> move<00:05:13.880> around<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:24.729> track<00:05:25.729> would<00:05:25.940> begin

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
as you move around the track would begin

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.939 
as you move around the track would begin
to<00:05:26.330> appear<00:05:28.990> so<00:05:29.990> at<00:05:30.050> this<00:05:30.169> point<00:05:30.440> is<00:05:30.650> moving

to appear so at this point is moving

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.300 
to appear so at this point is moving
away<00:05:31.039> from<00:05:31.220> the<00:05:31.550> camera<00:05:32.740> typically<00:05:33.740> will<00:05:33.979> mark

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
away from the camera typically will mark

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:43.089 
away from the camera typically will mark
a<00:05:34.460> track<00:05:35.710> at<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:37.490> heel<00:05:37.729> area<00:05:40.539> as<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:42.680> lot<00:05:42.979> of

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
a track at the heel area as a lot of

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.399 
a track at the heel area as a lot of
humans<00:05:43.460> tend<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:43.789> walk<00:05:44.000> from<00:05:44.240> heel<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.539> toe<00:05:44.720> so

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
humans tend to walk from heel to toe so

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.290 
humans tend to walk from heel to toe so
a<00:05:45.710> lot<00:05:45.979> of<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.130> impact<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.940> heel<00:05:47.120> the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
a lot of the impact is that the heel the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.379 
a lot of the impact is that the heel the
most<00:05:47.510> way<00:05:47.659> is<00:05:47.720> that<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:47.990> heel<00:05:48.880> watch<00:05:49.880> closely

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.730 

you<00:05:53.389> can<00:05:53.510> see<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.750> little<00:05:54.020> bit<00:05:54.139> of<00:05:54.289> a<00:05:54.409> shadow

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
you can see a little bit of a shadow

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.770 
you can see a little bit of a shadow
from<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.099> wall<00:05:55.400> of<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.669> track<00:05:55.940> out<00:05:56.210> of<00:05:56.630> wall

from the wall of the track out of wall

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:03.550 
from the wall of the track out of wall
the<00:05:56.930> track<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:01.550> track<00:06:02.110> will<00:06:03.110> start<00:06:03.380> to

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
the track the track will start to

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:14.620 
the track the track will start to
disappear

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.510 

and<00:06:15.630> this<00:06:15.780> is<00:06:15.960> a<00:06:15.990> simple<00:06:16.380> exercise<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.889> remind
