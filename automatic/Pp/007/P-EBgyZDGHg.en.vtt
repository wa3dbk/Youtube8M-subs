00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.830
 we are back has been very fast 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 we arrived from Huazulco this is called 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.490
 teleportation in two seconds 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.379
 welcome here to the core sas are art 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.540
 thanks for continuing now so in 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.900
 our company we have now a 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.900
 Caesar salad 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.270
 and I think we all like the salad 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.740
 Caesar and there are many variations of this 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.610
 salad right now let's make a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.960
 vinaigrette that is a bit basic 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.149
 but a little more elaborate 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 this one of the cream and this then 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.370
 Well, what are we going to need there? 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.949
 for the vinaigrette a little mayonnaise 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 this also a little bit of spicy 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.199
 chile picantito obviously anchovies 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.680
 because they can not miss in a cesar a 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.059
 little bit of water also parmesan cheese 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.159
 I recommend you use two types of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.670
 lettuce to give variety a little 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:00.550
 to taste and taste bread croutons 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.859
 and a little more Parmesan cheese we're going to 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.509
 use salt and pepper a few breasts 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.479
 chicken that I have here already and 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.909
 more and lemon juice to give you that 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.430
 special touch then to our saucer 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.470
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to take 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.640
 a piece of chicken 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.830
 and I'm going to make some band-aids, 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 fajitas 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.440
 then we do it quickly 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.200
 quickly you can do it at 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.850
 backwards they can put it to heat and then 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.670
 making the strips for me is easier 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 do it this way because then as 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.930
 it's hot the chicken there are some 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 terrible burns that I do not do not 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.740
 I wish nobody then with our 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.070
 chopped chicken we give you a little bit of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.610
 salt and pepper 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.050
 for the flavor roll and we put it in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.760
 this pan that here I already have 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.760
 smoking then let's put 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.950
 meters use of chick and in the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.440
 blender we're going to start doing the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.380
 dressing then let's place the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.509
 Mayonnaise 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.090
 that do not catch them like better with 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.000
 mayonnaise dressing and if you do not have plan 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.700
 mayonnaise officer and how is not good 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.170
 let's put a little bit of it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.670
 our ours when all the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.590
 Ingredients for anchovies vinaigrette 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.720
 chilito water 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.390
 a trickle of water 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 and that if Parmesan is enough to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.410
 that is tasty and now if we go 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 liquefy 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.110
 you are going to take a platÃ³n 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.880
 you already like this let's put it here 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.530

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.160
 what are we going to do this car put 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.810
 our reading that I recommend that the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.310
 atrocious in a little bit because then they 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.670
 they touch the two terrible heels another of 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.099
 these 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.099
 Puritan renters 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.640
 It's almost my chick and we turned it going 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.640
 to put some laces 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.380
 a little bit like that 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.380
 Oh, they want more 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.540
 and we put it here a little bit more than 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.540
 hearts 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.720
 it was like that not to be told and not to 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.720
 complain and now we are going to add 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.560
 this is going to put us here and we're going to 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.200
 add our chicken as it is 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.200

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.820

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.690
 palm of your hand we are going to put a 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.370
 little lemon to our vinaigrette 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.630
 we are going to liquefy again 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:20.290
 that what I did not want 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:22.830

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.830

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.740
