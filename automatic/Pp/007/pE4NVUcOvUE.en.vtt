00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
now the real the reason that we use the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.799 
now the real the reason that we use the
ribbon<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.980> allow<00:00:38.579> those<00:00:39.360> people

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
wire and tape method to adhere that on

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250 
wire and tape method to adhere that on
to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> bracelet<00:00:47.690> but<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> use

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to the bracelet but we're going to use

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.680 
to the bracelet but we're going to use
it<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.710> slightly<00:00:50.039> different<00:00:50.160> way<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:51.510> gonna

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it in a slightly different way I'm gonna

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810 
it in a slightly different way I'm gonna
take<00:00:51.930> those<00:00:52.110> ribbons<00:00:52.559> put<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> knot<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.340> them

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
take those ribbons put a knot in them

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.049 
take those ribbons put a knot in them
tie<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> disc<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:54.930> tight<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.879> then<00:00:56.879> at

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
tie that disc down tight and then at

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
tie that disc down tight and then at
this<00:00:57.210> point<00:00:57.539> cut<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> ribbons<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this point cut the ribbons off so it

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.310 
this point cut the ribbons off so it
allows<00:01:00.120> us<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.629> surface<00:01:01.170> area<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:02.100> work<00:01:02.340> into

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
allows us more surface area to work into

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.590 
allows us more surface area to work into
and<00:01:04.320> we're<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> begin<00:01:05.250> by<00:01:05.640> using<00:01:05.880> some

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and we're going to begin by using some

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.340 
and we're going to begin by using some
of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> permanent<00:01:07.320> leaves<00:01:08.689> dipping<00:01:09.689> those<00:01:09.900> in

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
of the permanent leaves dipping those in

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.300 
of the permanent leaves dipping those in
and<00:01:11.540> placing<00:01:12.540> those<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:13.110> onto<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.890> design

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and placing those right onto the design

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.880 
and placing those right onto the design
disc<00:01:17.540> now<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> might<00:01:18.869> look<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.320> odd<00:01:19.650> at

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
disc now it might look a little odd at

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.940 
disc now it might look a little odd at
the<00:01:19.979> beginning<00:01:20.840> with<00:01:21.840> these<00:01:22.020> leaves<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.650> far

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the beginning with these leaves so far

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.420 
the beginning with these leaves so far
out<00:01:24.049> but<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.290> happen<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.830> once<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> get

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
out but what will happen is once we get

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.210 
out but what will happen is once we get
our<00:01:26.580> flowers<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> other<00:01:27.390> additions<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.380> here

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.149 

it'll<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.610> bit<00:01:32.850> more<00:01:33.000> sense<00:01:34.159> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it'll make a little bit more sense the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880 
it'll make a little bit more sense the
next<00:01:35.340> thing<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> add<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.799> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
next thing that I'm going to add on is a
ribbon<00:01:38.310> treatment<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.119> you'll<00:01:39.600> notice<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
ribbon treatment and you'll notice that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.960 
ribbon treatment and you'll notice that
the<00:01:40.200> ribbon<00:01:40.500> treatment<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.100> been<00:01:41.130> fashioned

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the ribbon treatment has been fashioned

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.410 
the ribbon treatment has been fashioned
and<00:01:42.119> we've<00:01:42.750> used<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> Astro<00:01:43.950> wire<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:45.030> Fitz

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and we've used the Astro wire from Fitz

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.450 
and we've used the Astro wire from Fitz
and<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.200> becomes<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.710> decorative<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and it becomes a decorative and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.819 
and it becomes a decorative and
functional<00:01:47.850> wire<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> worry

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
functional wire I don't have to worry

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.090 
functional wire I don't have to worry
about<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.880> wire<00:01:51.090> showing<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.890> fact

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
about the the wire showing in the fact

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.910 
about the the wire showing in the fact
that<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.369> has<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.520> great<00:01:53.880> silver<00:01:54.560> foil<00:01:55.560> wrap

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that it has that great silver foil wrap

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.980 
that it has that great silver foil wrap
to<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> it'll<00:01:57.210> give<00:01:57.420> us<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.659> bit

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to that and it'll give us a little bit

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.069 
to that and it'll give us a little bit
more<00:01:58.200> interest<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> dip

liquid floral adhesive and really these

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
come out to be just almost like a little

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.620 
come out to be just almost like a little
centerpiece<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.940> you'll<00:03:10.060> notice<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.450> it's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
centerpiece and you'll notice that it's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.259 
centerpiece and you'll notice that it's
more<00:03:10.870> elongated<00:03:11.410> than<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.610> wide<00:03:12.910> and

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
more elongated than it is wide and

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.229 
more elongated than it is wide and
that's<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.600> we<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:14.010> put<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.100> on<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> arm<00:03:15.640> you

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
that's so we can put it on the arm you

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.030 
that's so we can put it on the arm you
know<00:03:16.330> touch<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.840> hand<00:03:17.080> go<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.650> arm<00:03:17.829> so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
know touch the hand go up the arm so

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.220 
know touch the hand go up the arm so
it's<00:03:18.190> not<00:03:18.310> broad<00:03:18.730> across<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> wrist<00:03:19.630> it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
it's not broad across the wrist it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.840

actually<00:03:20.799> mirrors<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:22.470> hand<00:03:23.470> itself<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
actually mirrors the hand itself and

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.539 
actually mirrors the hand itself and
