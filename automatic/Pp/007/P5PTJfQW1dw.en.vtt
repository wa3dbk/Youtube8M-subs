00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
somehow bring in the Hat no because this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.490 
somehow bring in the Hat no because this
is<00:02:06.630> something<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.960> she<00:02:07.229> wears<00:02:07.500> under<00:02:08.250> normal

formal event

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.000 
formal event
so<00:02:12.240> therefore<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.900> will<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.350> jeweled<00:02:13.770> crown

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
