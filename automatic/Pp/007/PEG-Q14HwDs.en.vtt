gage<00:01:43.500> goes<00:01:43.830> on<00:01:44.330> starts<00:01:45.330> blinking<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:45.840> you

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
gage goes on starts blinking when you

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.840 
gage goes on starts blinking when you
get<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> certain<00:01:46.380> type<00:01:46.620> of<00:01:46.650> decide<00:01:47.010> so

get to certain type of decide so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
get to certain type of decide so
temperature<00:01:48.480> math<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.080> then<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.350> goes<00:01:49.470> Solow

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
temperature math and then it goes Solow

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.290 
temperature math and then it goes Solow
and<00:01:49.980> you<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.160> their<00:01:50.310> next<00:01:50.430> number<00:01:50.700> come<00:01:50.850> on

and you'll see pictures of that right
about<00:03:24.280> now<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.290> checked<00:03:26.290> everything<00:03:26.530> else

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
about now I checked everything else

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.650 
about now I checked everything else
everything<00:03:27.700> looked<00:03:27.910> good<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.390> then<00:03:28.540> we

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
everything looked good and then we

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.060 
everything looked good and then we
started<00:03:29.080> putting<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.410> gaskets<00:03:29.800> on<00:03:29.920> and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
started putting the gaskets on and

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.770 
started putting the gaskets on and
putting<00:03:30.190> engine<00:03:30.520> back<00:03:30.640> together<00:03:30.820> now<00:03:31.720> we

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
putting engine back together now we

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.850 
putting engine back together now we
didn't<00:03:32.110> finish<00:03:32.200> putting<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> end<00:03:32.710> together

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
didn't finish putting the end together

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.230 
didn't finish putting the end together
because<00:03:33.220> we<00:03:33.340> were<00:03:33.520> taking<00:03:33.850> pictures<00:03:34.000> because

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
because we were taking pictures because

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.640 
because we were taking pictures because
we<00:03:34.450> wanted<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.720> put<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.900> engine<00:03:35.020> together<00:03:35.380> but

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
we wanted to put the engine together but

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:44.440 
we wanted to put the engine together but
you<00:03:35.920> get<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.160> picture

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
I've replaced the 120 are okay now I

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.310 
I've replaced the 120 are okay now I
noticed<00:04:54.790> that<00:04:54.910> my<00:04:55.030> voice<00:04:55.180> was<00:04:55.240> leaking<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.110> I

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
noticed that my voice was leaking and I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.220 
noticed that my voice was leaking and I
must<00:04:56.620> have<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.130> stopped<00:04:57.490> riding<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:59.050> may

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
must have I stopped riding it and I may

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.350 
must have I stopped riding it and I may
have<00:04:59.350> done<00:04:59.560> like<00:04:59.770> maybe<00:05:00.460> once<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.120> sort<00:05:01.330> of

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
have done like maybe once a sort of

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.000 
have done like maybe once a sort of
thinking<00:05:01.960> maybe<00:05:02.110> about<00:05:02.350> two<00:05:02.500> hours<00:05:02.650> of<00:05:02.860> riding

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
thinking maybe about two hours of riding

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.760 
thinking maybe about two hours of riding
to<00:05:03.280> get<00:05:03.400> my<00:05:03.520> butt<00:05:04.000> back<00:05:04.030> home<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:05.380> I<00:05:05.560> thought<00:05:05.590> I

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
to get my butt back home so I thought I

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.960 
to get my butt back home so I thought I
was<00:05:05.890> arriving<00:05:06.130> but<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.370> was<00:05:06.490> all<00:05:06.580> cool<00:05:06.790> it

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
was arriving but it was all cool it

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.370 
was arriving but it was all cool it
wasn't<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.390> traffic<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.900> stuff<00:05:08.080> like<00:05:08.170> that

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
wasn't in traffic and stuff like that

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.010 
wasn't in traffic and stuff like that
but<00:05:09.130> um<00:05:09.340> here's<00:05:09.910> what<00:05:10.060> happens<00:05:10.390> when<00:05:10.480> you<00:05:10.690> this

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
but um here's what happens when you this

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.270 
but um here's what happens when you this
is<00:05:11.170> why<00:05:11.320> cylinders<00:05:11.800> warp<00:05:12.360> if<00:05:13.360> you're<00:05:13.630> riding

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
is why cylinders warp if you're riding

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.560 
is why cylinders warp if you're riding
and<00:05:15.280> your<00:05:16.090> engine<00:05:16.300> leaks<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:18.040> leak

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
and your engine leaks that leak

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.990 
and your engine leaks that leak
but<00:05:19.840> where<00:05:20.050> that's<00:05:20.260> on<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.560> slate<00:05:21.190> it's<00:05:21.820> going

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
but where that's on the slate it's going

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.370 
but where that's on the slate it's going
to<00:05:22.060> be<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.240> clone<00:05:22.450> spot<00:05:22.750> for<00:05:22.960> all<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.200> oil

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
to be the clone spot for all the oil
