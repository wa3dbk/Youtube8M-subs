00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.660
 dear techno android friends 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.590
 welcome to this new ours 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.449
 video tutorial in which we will explain you 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 how to read a usb stick at 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.970
 nexus 5 all we have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.900
 need is obviously rennes on the 5 a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 micro usb usb cable otg precisely for 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 connect it with the key and clear it 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 an interest or sd to read the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.219
 our lecture 5 we start immediately with 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 say that nexus 5 must be unlocked e 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.410
 have and must have root permissions 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.140
 obviously you can't do otherwise 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 nothing then you have to install stick mount 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 this program how many I already have 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.600
 installed that will allow us to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.640
 see the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.670
 the contents of the usb stick 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.860
 available is a free version 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.900
 that a pro but it's fine too 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.880
 the free one 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.820
 once installed we must not do 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:25.009
 other than then we connect the cable o 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:28.970
 tg to nexus 5 then we connect here the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:34.520
 our key and now if it appears 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.560
 stick mount that is asked to reopen 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.030
 stickman when this usb device 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.149
 has connected 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.590
 obviously I put the check in that in 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.030
 so that it happens as a setting 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.000
 default that we give to confirms it as 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.220
 you can see request root permissions 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 and we grant them forever 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.549
 and here it is and it has been mounted now 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.060
 we can read the contents of 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.280
 key 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.049
 well now what we have to do though 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.049
 flaws inside the key 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.570
 we have to use a file manager goes 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.519
 very well like a file manager like them 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.350
 manager that you find for free on 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:22.489
 play store or how to use io solid 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.040
 explorer on the ideon ploner and inside 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.200
 navigated inside the folders up 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.930
 to find that usb this 4 you see here 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.239
 usb storage the first but I have inside plot 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 sda1 which obviously is not the courier 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.130
 that the fair key we try to everything 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.600
 all in the content of the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.190
 key now some music but 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.190
 we also try to listen to a song 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:58.160
 ok perfect and now for the current a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.380
 key we remove here done now 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.870
 we can even if not okay that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.680
 give this was a guide on how 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.930
 read a usb stick on the nexus 5 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.959
 finally in the available nexus cinco 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.160
 the tg which was not available in the nexus 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.540
 4 and many pieces had complained about it 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.070
