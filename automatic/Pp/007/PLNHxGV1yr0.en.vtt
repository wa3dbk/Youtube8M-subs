great<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.379> wear<00:00:46.559> alone<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:48.059> skin<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
great to wear alone but my skin is a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.770 
great to wear alone but my skin is a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to be winter right now as I'm sure most

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
to be winter right now as I'm sure most
of<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.670> wreaking

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of you know and it is just like wreaking

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.990 
of you know and it is just like wreaking
havoc<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:58.020> face<00:00:58.260> I've<00:00:58.949> read<00:00:59.609> people

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
havoc on my face I've read people

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
havoc on my face I've read people
suggest<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.949> does<00:01:02.129> leave<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.550> face

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
suggest that if it does leave your face

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420 
suggest that if it does leave your face
to<00:01:03.000> dry<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.320> simply<00:01:05.070> put<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to dry then you just simply put a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.260 
to dry then you just simply put a
moisturizer<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.830> underneath<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.000> would

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
moisturizer on underneath so this would

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
moisturizer on underneath so this would
be<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.689> point<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.380> would<00:01:10.439> put<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
be the point at which I would put the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
be the point at which I would put the
beauty<00:01:11.130> balm<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.630> BB<00:01:12.930> cream<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:15.119> looks

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
beauty balm on the BB cream and it looks

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
beauty balm on the BB cream and it looks
like<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> kind<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
like this if you can see you can kind of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
like this if you can see you can kind of
see<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:21.210> bits<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> pigment<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.049> there

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
see like little bits of pigment in there

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:32.780 
see like little bits of pigment in there
I<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.970> gently<00:01:25.159> smooth<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:32.640> can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I just gently smooth it on and you can

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760 
I just gently smooth it on and you can
start<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> gives<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.200> skin<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
start to see that it gives your skin a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.120 
start to see that it gives your skin a
finished<00:01:35.280> look<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.909> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.570> dry<00:01:37.130> lotion

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
finished look it's kind of a dry lotion

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.690 
finished look it's kind of a dry lotion
so<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> dries<00:01:38.729> quickly<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.350> would<00:01:41.340> say<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so it dries quickly and I would say you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
so it dries quickly and I would say you
need<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> rub<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.720> quickly<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.320> else<00:01:43.409> that's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
need to rub it in quickly or else that's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.929 
need to rub it in quickly or else that's
going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.479> dry<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:45.960> skin<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> leave

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
going to dry out on your skin and leave

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.389 
going to dry out on your skin and leave
white<00:01:47.939> splotches<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> first<00:01:49.740> put

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
white splotches I think when I first put

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399 
white splotches I think when I first put
it<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.299> makes<00:01:51.540> my<00:01:51.780> face<00:01:51.960> look<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.259> little

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it on it makes my face look a little

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
it on it makes my face look a little
chalky<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.610> true<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.000> any

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
chalky but I think that's true with any

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
chalky but I think that's true with any
makeup<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.840> me<00:01:54.960> usually<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.740> has<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> rest<00:01:56.399> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
makeup for me usually it has to rest for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
makeup for me usually it has to rest for
like<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:56.939> hour<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.509> until<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> natural<00:01:58.320> oils

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
like an hour just until the natural oils

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.930 
like an hour just until the natural oils
in<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.799> skin<00:01:58.950> come<00:01:59.399> out

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
in your skin come out

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.520 
in your skin come out
don't<00:02:00.120> make<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.390> look<00:02:00.480> natural<00:02:00.690> well

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
don't make it look natural well

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.750 
don't make it look natural well
hopefully<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.980> look<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.400> bit<00:02:02.610> better

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
hopefully I look a little bit better
