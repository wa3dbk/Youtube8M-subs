00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 well the weather is complicated because it 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.819
 has lengthened the drizzle that in any 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.580
 moment can be heavy rain is 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.320
 cloudy but we have guaranteed the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 future and we have guaranteed the summer 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
 my friends because you have to make friends 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.039
 of the lifeguards, not the bañeros 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.289
 because lifeguards do not go to anyone 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.900
 you know are the ones that go to the sun 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 all day the most mines have the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.769
 they are calm watching everyone look 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.019
 and I 'm almost dressed lifeguard 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.019
 true good teacher sees richard to 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.510
 far away half of the candle is 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.969
 all good 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.750
 and it's like that lifeguard life is so 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.930
 Quiet as one imagines is beautiful and 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.609
 not so quiet but not the good 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.280
 how many years as a lifeguard because 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.430
 I have understood a doctor thing too 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 25 years d 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.700
 and as a doctor works as a doctor this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 it's something else but I 've always shared 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.140
 the coast always as is the theme of the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.600
 security as it would be for people to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.190
 be aware because people believe 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 that is going to that the sea is all right not 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.220
 nothing happens but I imagine that there is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 have a message of care yes more than not 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 fear but yes respect 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.439
 has has is risky Us 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.240
 we know two or three little things that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.659
 we advise the people and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.659
 we say 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 we give a couple of tips and good and for 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.570
 have a good time that's what it's about 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.220
 that's what it's about 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.840
 we have here also to fernando that 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 we lifeguards how old 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.230
 how would you keep 22 22 always the party 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.630
 of the coast has changed work 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.240
 kan trees and then comes the coast of the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.790
 coast I have 19 seasons of municipal 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.440
 it's totally if diego did not want 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.290
 ask them how is the training 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.120
 to do guardian life that involves and that 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.640
 you have to have it because it really is a 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.250
 very complicated work very complex 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.710
 situation is absolute risk 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.110
 absolutely limits that you have to have 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.320
 How do you make it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.979
 good 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.040
 actually the season here those that more 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.390
 they work four months in the year 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.300
 but good 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.830
 activities are done there is a lot of activity 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.740
 sports and winter tournaments and aside 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.410
 of first aid training rcp 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.820
 and when the season starts 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.960
 every schedule has to a 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.550
 revalidated that is a physical test that 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.890
 does in sink in some places either 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.370
 in the sea according to the area of ​​a base to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.470
 work and there are times and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.470
 then in a also theoretical part of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.390
 first aid and rcp is signed the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.970
 notebook and is enabled to work 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.500
 if you do not 26 unless you can not be 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.550
 enabled but the lifeguard at the end 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.070
 trains all year to 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.020
 for this activity you were just talking about 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.730
 you also worked in countries what 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.830
 difference there is between a lifeguard that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.140
 he works in the pool and the sea is 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.630
 totally different are not really 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.220
 everything in a guard is not received is 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.760
 trained to work so much in more 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.520
 river lagoons pools whatever it was some 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.860
 for a matter of activity that 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.220
 develop capable work in pool and 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.200
 others like the sea more and apart 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.670
 have availability to be able to come to 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.590
 the coast of two months or three months of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.560
 an activity that allows you to come to 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.720
 work to the east coast these machine 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.150
 of occasions in sergio doctors there are 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.970
 many have other professions too 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.350
 here that by vocation one always 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.540
 ingenia to be able to go to the coast to 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.070
 work if tamara we are listening and 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.920
 I wanted to consult what are the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.660
 accidents or situations in which 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.520
 they have to save lives more 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.470
 frequently on the coast that should 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.200
 know the people that this summer will go to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.200
 the beach what are the tips to go 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.810
 and one of the main tips is what 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.680
 good that they approach the positions of 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.680
 lifeguard that 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.260
 ask us do we make a 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.959
 very preventive activity where we indicate 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.489
 the zones and in case the danger 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.620
 here the problem is the bottom of the sea 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.030
 when sometimes for a sub state with 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.959
 the tides break the sandbar 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.579
 it causes dangers to occur that 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.190
 people may have some danger of 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.590
 rescue not because people are internal 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.910
 but because the sea can a start 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.810
 in some waist by the conditions 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.340
 others are not good 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.380
 then good communication with the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.669
 daycare that makes one able to spend 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.010
 a quiet vacation as he said 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.330
 sergio and preventive activity 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.919
 fundamental not 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.199
 fernando let me come a second 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.870
 to fit and that marito come are the 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.430
 two extremes I will not say the most 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.080
 big the biggest the biggest but the one 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.810
 more experience and within that team 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.910
 you be younger doctors and you can well 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.080
 how is working here because it is the most 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.310
 young man if you go crazy 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.390
 actually, you learned a lot from the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.770
 people with experience but 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.930
 [Music] 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.810
 you learn a lot and it's cute 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.340
 work with experienced people and 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.340
 Marito who says bad and everything less 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.900
 [Music] 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.900

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.759
 will debut is to look at the eyes that you have 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.300

 lifeguard and it was too hard the 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.200
 truth was truly but too much 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.000
