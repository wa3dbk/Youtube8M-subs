baby's<00:00:35.489> upward<00:00:35.910> momentum<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.690> possibly<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
baby's upward momentum or possibly the

still stuck on the eagle's claws the
next<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.120> stands<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
next thing that stands out is the

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.709 
next thing that stands out is the
child's<00:00:47.129> guardian<00:00:47.579> doesn't<00:00:48.210> turn<00:00:48.390> his<00:00:48.510> head

toward<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> commotion<00:00:49.620> until<00:00:50.370> much<00:00:50.640> later

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
toward the commotion until much later

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.689 
toward the commotion until much later
than<00:00:51.180> expected<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.649> almost<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.250> he<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.489> no

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
than expected it's almost like he has no

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.130 
than expected it's almost like he has no
peripheral<00:00:54.059> vision<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.750> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
peripheral vision or is really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
back now notice the Eagle shadow it kind

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
back now notice the Eagle shadow it kind
of<00:01:01.020> appears<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> nowhere<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.460> point

you'd<00:01:03.570> expect<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.559> fluid<00:01:05.489> transition<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you'd expect a more fluid transition is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.890 
you'd expect a more fluid transition is
this<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> CGI<00:01:08.040> air<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.909> could<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.720> the

this a CGI air or could this be do the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
cameras angle one more thing to consider

cameras angle one more thing to consider
the<00:01:20.340> last<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> mention<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.049> baby

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the last thing to mention is the baby

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
the last thing to mention is the baby
seeming<00:01:22.860> completely<00:01:23.460> limp<00:01:23.729> during<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
seeming completely limp during the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
seeming completely limp during the
entire<00:01:24.750> ordeal<00:01:25.229> including<00:01:26.040> while<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> drops

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
entire ordeal including while it drops

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.670 
entire ordeal including while it drops
to<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> floor<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.869> reminds<00:01:28.380> me<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
to the floor it reminds me of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.460 
to the floor it reminds me of
computer-generated<00:01:29.400> physics<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.229> just

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
computer-generated physics but it's just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
computer-generated physics but it's just
the<00:01:31.650> baby<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.220> maybe<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.939> wouldn't

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the baby and maybe you wouldn't

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.870 
the baby and maybe you wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.990> flailing<00:01:34.380> around<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.100> don't

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
necessarily be flailing around I don't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.280 
necessarily be flailing around I don't
have<00:01:36.000> too<00:01:36.210> much<00:01:36.329> experience<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
have too much experience in that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.560 
have too much experience in that
department<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> those<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> parts<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
department so those are the parts of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.359 
department so those are the parts of
this<00:01:39.720> video<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.320> made<00:01:40.500> me<00:01:40.680> question<00:01:41.130> its

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this video that made me question its

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.510 
this video that made me question its
authenticity<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.560> fact<00:01:44.280> or

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
authenticity what do you think fact or
