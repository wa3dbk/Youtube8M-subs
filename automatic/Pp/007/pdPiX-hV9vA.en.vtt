 Oh the food cooked by itself, the sister of the soil is too crowded 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.440
 In that sense, Korean food is creativity . 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:57.420
 Some people like to eat seafood 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:02.489

 And whether the side dishes are vegetable or not 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.599
 Springtime , when the world thinks about health, it makes the first mistake. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.500
