00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
oh my gosh burp City we have like I was

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.240 
oh my gosh burp City we have like I was
I<00:03:21.690> would<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.959> presume<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.530> be<00:03:22.590> either<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.950> gas

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
I would I presume to be either a gas

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.910 
I would I presume to be either a gas
station<00:03:23.550> or<00:03:23.910> an<00:03:24.360> ATM<00:03:24.900> Bank<00:03:25.230> now<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> reason<00:03:25.860> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
station or an ATM Bank now the reason I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.410 
station or an ATM Bank now the reason I
think<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> bank<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.760> because<00:03:26.970> if<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.300> in

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
think is a bank is because if you go in

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.530 
think is a bank is because if you go in
here<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:28.230> got<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.650> desk<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:30.360> just

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
here it's got like a desk and it just

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.970 
here it's got like a desk and it just
seems<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.930> more<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.290> bank<00:03:31.560> than<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> gas

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
seems like more of a bank than a gas

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.979 
seems like more of a bank than a gas
station<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.400> me<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.880> don't<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.690> says

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
station to me but I don't think it says

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.690 
station to me but I don't think it says
anywhere<00:03:34.410> correct<00:03:34.739> me<00:03:34.860> from<00:03:35.010> wrong<00:03:35.250> but<00:03:35.670> I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
anywhere correct me from wrong but I

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.920 
anywhere correct me from wrong but I
don't<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.030> says<00:03:36.300> anywhere<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.720> doesn't

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
don't think it says anywhere it doesn't

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.560 
don't think it says anywhere it doesn't
have<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.050> huge<00:03:37.459> gas<00:03:38.459> sign<00:03:38.820> or<00:03:39.120> anything<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
have a huge gas sign or anything so I

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.990 
have a huge gas sign or anything so I
think<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:40.020> would<00:03:40.230> probably<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:41.000> probably

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
think this would probably be probably

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.180 
think this would probably be probably
being<00:03:42.180> ATM<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:43.140> my<00:03:43.290> assumption<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.830> bank<00:03:44.040> with

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
being ATM just my assumption a bank with

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.740 
being ATM just my assumption a bank with
a<00:03:44.250> little<00:03:44.670> drive-through<00:03:45.060> ATM<00:03:45.120> thing<00:03:45.600> image

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
a little drive-through ATM thing image

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.990 
a little drive-through ATM thing image
it<00:03:45.870> going<00:03:46.050> on<00:03:46.170> there<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> does<00:03:47.580> have<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.790> G

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
it going on there but it does have a G

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.880 
it going on there but it does have a G
here<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.720> may<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.019> gas<00:03:49.260> station<00:03:49.500> whoops

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
here so that may be a gas station whoops

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.710 
here so that may be a gas station whoops
I<00:03:50.100> may<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.310> failed<00:03:50.580> there<00:03:50.850> Wow<00:03:51.090> sorry<00:03:51.570> about

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
I may have failed there Wow sorry about

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.470 
I may have failed there Wow sorry about
that<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.680> would<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.340> hospitality<00:03:53.970> by

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that so this would be the hospitality by

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.820 
that so this would be the hospitality by
the<00:03:54.540> sign<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.019> can<00:03:55.140> tell<00:03:55.290> by<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.440> first<00:03:55.680> date

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.830 
with me when I can go to the top floor
and<00:04:39.520> go<00:04:39.580> into<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.789> pool<00:04:40.000> that's<00:04:40.569> what<00:04:40.750> I'm

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
and go into a pool that's what I'm

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.050 
and go into a pool that's what I'm
talking<00:04:41.349> about<00:04:41.410> that<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.430> what<00:04:42.460> I'm<00:04:42.669> talking

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
talking about that is what I'm talking

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.029 
talking about that is what I'm talking
about<00:04:43.240> give<00:04:43.419> me<00:04:43.539> give<00:04:43.870> me<00:04:43.900> it

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.939 

I've<00:04:48.039> won<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.210> won<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.870> won<00:04:49.900> there<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.650> go<00:04:50.770> I'm

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
I've won I won I won there you go I'm

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.040 
I've won I won I won there you go I'm
booked<00:04:51.190> we<00:04:51.370> then<00:04:51.520> we<00:04:51.819> did<00:04:51.970> we<00:04:52.389> done<00:04:52.599> won<00:04:52.810> and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
booked we then we did we done won and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.300 
booked we then we did we done won and
then<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.560> guess<00:04:53.710> is<00:04:53.860> where<00:04:53.979> you<00:04:54.069> can<00:04:54.160> put<00:04:54.280> all

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
then I guess is where you can put all

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.860 
then I guess is where you can put all
your<00:04:54.370> towels<00:04:54.699> and<00:04:54.970> such<00:04:55.150> like<00:04:55.389> that<00:04:55.569> and<00:04:55.780> then

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
your towels and such like that and then

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.659 
your towels and such like that and then
you<00:04:55.960> walk<00:04:56.169> through<00:04:56.380> here<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.949> walk<00:04:57.280> out<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
you walk through here you walk out the

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.110 
you walk through here you walk out the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
window and you know I'm saying like that

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.040

you<00:05:02.620> could<00:05:02.740> probably<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:03.280> probably<00:05:04.120> do<00:05:04.300> that

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449
