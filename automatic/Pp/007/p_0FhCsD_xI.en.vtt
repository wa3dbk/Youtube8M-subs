00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.350 
more of the pink color onto the wet eye
shadows<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.340> will<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.459> vibrant<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
shadows so that it will be vibrant and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
shadows so that it will be vibrant and
it<00:02:27.720> won't<00:02:27.900> crease<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.099> it's<00:02:29.280> filed

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it won't crease because if it's filed

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.630 
it won't crease because if it's filed
and<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> don't<00:02:30.360> apply<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> good<00:02:31.290> amount<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.800> dry

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
and you don't apply a good amount of dry

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.150 
and you don't apply a good amount of dry
eye<00:02:32.670> shadow<00:02:33.239> on<00:02:33.360> top<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.020> done<00:02:34.650> tend<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
eye shadow on top it's done tend to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.710 
eye shadow on top it's done tend to
crease<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.810> apply<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:38.090> layer<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.120> dry

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
crease so I just apply a layer of dry

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.350 
crease so I just apply a layer of dry
eye<00:02:39.750> shadow<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:41.190> makes<00:02:41.400> sense<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.180> that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
eye shadow that makes sense so that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.970 
eye shadow that makes sense so that
it'll<00:02:43.140> stay<00:02:43.440> put<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.380> I'm<00:02:46.590> going<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.800> take

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it'll stay put so then I'm going to take

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.330 
it'll stay put so then I'm going to take

then<00:03:47.640> I'm<00:03:47.790> bringing<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.340> little

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
then I'm bringing it in just a little

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.890 
then I'm bringing it in just a little
bit<00:03:51.200> going<00:03:52.549> windshield<00:03:53.549> wiper<00:03:54.000> motions<00:03:54.480> and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
bit going windshield wiper motions and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.470 
bit going windshield wiper motions and
circular<00:03:55.440> motions<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.090> see<00:03:57.120> I'm

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
circular motions and as you can see I'm

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.180 
circular motions and as you can see I'm
working<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.739> little<00:03:59.040> by<00:03:59.160> little

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
working it just little by little

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.840 
working it just little by little
building<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> color<00:04:00.329> it's<00:04:00.660> better<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.890> build

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
building the color it's better to build

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.559 
building the color it's better to build
the<00:04:03.120> color<00:04:04.100> little<00:04:05.100> by<00:04:05.250> little<00:04:05.280> than<00:04:05.940> making

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
the color little by little than making

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.140 
the color little by little than making
it<00:04:06.840> super<00:04:07.200> intense<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.459> you're<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:08.880> trying

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
it super intense and you're just trying

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.509 
it super intense and you're just trying
to<00:04:09.239> blend<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.630> out<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:10.319> harder<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.890> way<00:04:10.920> and

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
to blend it out it's harder that way and

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.830 
to blend it out it's harder that way and
your<00:04:12.359> color<00:04:12.630> won't<00:04:13.130> be<00:04:14.130> as<00:04:14.340> vibrant<00:04:14.840> compared

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
your color won't be as vibrant compared

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.849 
your color won't be as vibrant compared
to<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.260> bringing<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.510> blending<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.630> in

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
to it bringing it in blending it in

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.969 
to it bringing it in blending it in
circular<00:04:19.859> motions<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.609> slowly<00:04:21.479> adding<00:04:22.440> color

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
circular motions and slowly adding color

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.969 
circular motions and slowly adding color
little<00:04:23.370> by<00:04:23.490> little<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.289> is<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
little by little so this is like the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.180 
little by little so this is like the
longest<00:04:26.010> technique<00:04:26.990> for<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.140> look<00:04:28.500> blending

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
longest technique for this look blending

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.410 
longest technique for this look blending
is<00:04:29.400> key

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
is key

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.170 
is key
and<00:04:30.510> I'm<00:04:31.320> being<00:04:31.800> very<00:04:33.380> patient<00:04:34.730> just<00:04:35.730> building

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
and I'm being very patient just building

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.540 
and I'm being very patient just building
that<00:04:36.390> color<00:04:36.660> in<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.800> why<00:04:38.040> it's<00:04:38.190> taking

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
that color in that's why it's taking

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.550 
that color in that's why it's taking
forever<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.630> build<00:04:39.750> that<00:04:39.870> color<00:04:40.260> and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
forever to just build that color and

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
forever to just build that color and
just<00:04:41.430> putting<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.540> in<00:04:43.220> place<00:04:46.340> I'm<00:04:47.340> not

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
just putting it in place I'm not

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.280 
just putting it in place I'm not
