two bolt actions as the US are and the l
116<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.530> like<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
116 I think it is I think it's like the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.030 
116 I think it is I think it's like the
same<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.100> from<00:02:42.569> l<00:02:43.569> 116<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.560> same<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:44.890> from

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
same one from l 116 the same one from

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.390 
same one from l 116 the same one from
Morrow<00:02:45.610> for<00:02:45.700> three<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.800> didn't<00:02:48.130> really<00:02:48.250> get

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.290 
in the morning and the Sun was coming up
right<00:02:59.350> before<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.650> went<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.890> bed<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.160> i<00:03:00.880> was

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
right before I went to bed I i was

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.780 
right before I went to bed I i was
playing<00:03:01.480> private<00:03:01.870> match<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.040> bots<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.670> i

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
playing private match like on bots and i

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.650 
playing private match like on bots and i
was<00:03:03.910> testing<00:03:04.330> out<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> l<00:03:04.950> 116<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:07.360> actually

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
was testing out the l 116 and I actually

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.870 
was testing out the l 116 and I actually
really<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.830> think<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.250> might<00:03:09.580> be<00:03:09.610> my

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
really like I think that might be my

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.140 
really like I think that might be my
main<00:03:10.060> sniper<00:03:10.390> I'm<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.780> sure<00:03:11.080> yet<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:12.150> it's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
main sniper I'm not sure yet but it's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.740 
main sniper I'm not sure yet but it's
like<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.989> has<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.200> little<00:03:14.470> bit<00:03:14.560> more<00:03:14.680> damage<00:03:15.190> and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
like it has a little bit more damage and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.190 
like it has a little bit more damage and
it's<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:16.930> as<00:03:17.140> accurate<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:17.980> it's<00:03:18.100> like<00:03:18.310> I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it's not as accurate but it's like I

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.270 
it's not as accurate but it's like I
don't<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.739> just<00:03:20.769> like<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.250> way
