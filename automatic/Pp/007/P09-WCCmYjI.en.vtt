00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 the smoke development centrix 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.359
 There are three types of life at depths like 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 desktop 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.379
 with trainers and industrial 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.230
 in this video give some tips that can help you choose the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.060
 correct type of printer 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.659
 desktop printers are compact printers 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.659
 with a print width of 104 millimeters 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.279
 at best at 20 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130
 for the small roll of labels 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.210
 and processed small rolls of printvalley 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.610
 but therefore advise these points 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 if you find a small number of labels per day 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 as an application you can think 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 at places where there is limited space for the printer 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 for example on a job or in a cupboard 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.880
 with no sprinters 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.590
 are a bit bigger than that is printers but still fairly compact 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.510
 they are available in plastic and metal versions 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.630
 with a print width of 104 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.610
 or 170 millimeters 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.290
 in the mid range sprinter 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.430
 by the large roll of labels 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 approached a large role by telephone 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.910
 up to 450 meters 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.930
 this means that the media has to change less often 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.550
 for this reason, we often recommend this printer faster than a desktop 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.860
 nice 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.690
 placement can be at a counter or at an administration 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 but for example also in the light men are surroundings 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.790
 industrial label printers are large metal printers 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.790
 with print width of 104 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.680
 128 170 or the 120 millimeter 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.130
 the difference compared to the two sprinters is that large roles 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.860
 point loss can work 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.920
 up to 625 meters 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.960
 these printers are used in industrial or does it do 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 environments 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.430
 or if you have known large quantities of labels per day 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.559
 all types of label printers 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:12.509
 are visible with options such as the dispensers rebounders 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.609
 or cutters 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.089
 in addition, the external options are possible 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.620
 just as residents can handle too large a role for labels 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.439
 they were, after all 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.139
 barcode scanners for data and joints 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.409
 or online data centers 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.559
 the choice for the type of label printer 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.179
 depends on the application and the environment at all times 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.379
 and we will gladly advise you on this
