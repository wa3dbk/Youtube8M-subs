00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
was running and I couldn't really figure

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.109 
was running and I couldn't really figure
it<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.800> got<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.830> lot<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> good<00:01:29.220> comments<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it out got a lot of good comments and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
it out got a lot of good comments and
suggestions<00:01:30.899> but<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.970> particular<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
suggestions but one in particular it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.160 
suggestions but one in particular it
made<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.320> bit

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
made me think a little bit

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.070 
made me think a little bit
mr.<00:01:37.170> tow<00:01:37.350> wrecker<00:01:38.390> thanks<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> him<00:01:39.690> he<00:01:39.780> left<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
mr. tow wrecker thanks to him he left a

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.200 
mr. tow wrecker thanks to him he left a
comment<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.679> he<00:01:41.520> said<00:01:41.700> he<00:01:41.789> had<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.940> similar

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
comment and he said he had a similar

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060 
comment and he said he had a similar
problem<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.929> one<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> his<00:01:43.470> trucks<00:01:43.770> he<00:01:43.979> was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
problem and one of his trucks he was

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
problem and one of his trucks he was
working<00:01:44.429> on<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.380> he<00:01:46.380> said<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.539> pull<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.690> pump

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
working on and he said to pull the pump

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
working on and he said to pull the pump
out<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> there's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.460> rubber<00:01:50.700> line<00:01:51.030> in

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
out and there's a little rubber line in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.460 
out and there's a little rubber line in
there<00:01:53.149> overtime<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.569> new<00:01:54.720> ethanol<00:01:55.050> gas

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
there overtime with the new ethanol gas

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.219 
there overtime with the new ethanol gas
and<00:01:55.800> stuff<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.190> guess<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.630> eats<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and stuff I guess it eats it up and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.279 
and stuff I guess it eats it up and
splits<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> line<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.690> therefore<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.259> lose

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
splits the line so therefore you lose

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.070 
splits the line so therefore you lose
pressure<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.550> would<00:02:02.729> explain<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.179> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
pressure and that would explain the the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.199 
pressure and that would explain the the
way<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.470> rot<00:02:04.679> on<00:02:04.860> lower<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.819> know<00:02:05.940> on

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
way it would rot on lower you know on

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.020 
way it would rot on lower you know on
like<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.630> quarter<00:02:06.959> of<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.080> tank<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.410> gas<00:02:07.440> or<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
like a quarter of a tank of gas or so so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.660 
like a quarter of a tank of gas or so so
I<00:02:09.709> got<00:02:10.709> watching<00:02:11.130> some<00:02:11.310> videos<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:13.670> watched

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
I got watching some videos and I watched

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.790 
I got watching some videos and I watched
like<00:02:14.940> four<00:02:15.239> videos<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.900> guys<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.560> had<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
like four videos the guys that had the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.479 
like four videos the guys that had the
same<00:02:17.099> exact<00:02:17.459> problem<00:02:17.879> as<00:02:17.970> me<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.830> they<00:02:19.830> they

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
same exact problem as me and they they

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.699 
same exact problem as me and they they
took<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.940> pump<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.720> sending<00:02:22.200> unit<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
took the pump out the sending unit and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.949 
took the pump out the sending unit and
it<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> piece<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.239> rubber<00:02:24.420> line<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.840> was

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it was a piece of rubber line that was

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.729 
it was a piece of rubber line that was
split<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.940> said<00:02:27.599> no<00:02:27.750> that's<00:02:27.959> probably<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.620> I

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
split so I said no that's probably it I

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.890 
split so I said no that's probably it I
said<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.959> watched<00:02:30.959> one<00:02:31.200> guy<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.739> he<00:02:32.900> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
said well I watched one guy and he you

said well I watched one guy and he you
didn't<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.830> know<00:02:34.950> didn't<00:02:35.489> want<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
didn't want to you know didn't want to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
didn't want to you know didn't want to
take<00:02:35.849> his<00:02:35.970> tank<00:02:36.239> oh<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.599> me<00:02:36.780> cuz<00:02:37.080> everything

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
take his tank oh like me cuz everything

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.500 
take his tank oh like me cuz everything
was<00:02:38.040> all<00:02:38.190> rusted<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.090> lines<00:02:39.300> are

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
was all rusted and all the lines are

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
was all rusted and all the lines are
rotted<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:39.989> stuff<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.340> he<00:02:41.580> ended<00:02:41.849> up<00:02:42.530> pulling

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
rotted and stuff so he ended up pulling

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.400 
rotted and stuff so he ended up pulling
the<00:02:43.739> bed<00:02:43.920> off<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.750> thought<00:02:45.750> about<00:02:45.870> doing<00:02:46.019> that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the bed off I thought about doing that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.199 
the bed off I thought about doing that
but<00:02:46.620> even<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> more<00:02:47.730> work<00:02:47.940> than<00:02:48.120> I

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
but even that was a more work than I

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.750 
but even that was a more work than I
really<00:02:48.480> wanted<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:50.280> then<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.430> watched

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
really wanted to do so then I watched

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.390 
really wanted to do so then I watched
another<00:02:51.150> couple<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.540> guys<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:53.220> guys

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
another couple of guys and the guys

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.990 
another couple of guys and the guys
today<00:02:54.920> airplanes<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.129> hatches

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
today airplanes have hatches

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.150 
today airplanes have hatches
why<00:02:58.690> can't<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.290> and<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:01.860> follow<00:03:02.860> his

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
why can't I have one and I follow his

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.040 
why can't I have one and I follow his
lead<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:05.340> cut<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> hatch<00:03:06.610> cut<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> hole<00:03:07.870> right

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
lead and I cut a hatch cut a hole right

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.290 
lead and I cut a hatch cut a hole right
there<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:10.140> hold<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.320> pump<00:03:11.530> right<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.890> just

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.450 

drilled<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.450> hole<00:03:16.510> right<00:03:16.900> there

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
drilled that hole right there

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.070 
drilled that hole right there
so<00:03:18.460> that<00:03:18.580> we<00:03:18.670> can<00:03:18.820> get<00:03:18.970> an<00:03:19.090> idea<00:03:19.450> where<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.840> was

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
so that we can get an idea where I was

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.800 
so that we can get an idea where I was
at<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:21.190> went<00:03:21.370> ahead<00:03:21.460> and<00:03:21.750> took<00:03:22.750> a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
at and then just went ahead and took a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.340 
at and then just went ahead and took a
regular<00:03:23.130> grinder<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.340> just<00:03:24.900> cut<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.050> out
