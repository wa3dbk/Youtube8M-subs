00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
that it doesn't absorb very well but

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.659 
that it doesn't absorb very well but
then<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.530> thing<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.829> when<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.219> fixing<00:02:42.430> my

then the thing is when I was fixing my
eczema<00:02:42.939> I<00:02:43.359> noticed<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:45.120> medication<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
eczema I noticed that the medication the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.330 
eczema I noticed that the medication the
doctor<00:02:46.510> gave<00:02:46.659> me<00:02:46.719> um<00:02:47.109> for<00:02:47.469> my<00:02:47.560> eczema<00:02:47.950> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
doctor gave me um for my eczema it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.940 
doctor gave me um for my eczema it
doesn't<00:02:48.700> serve<00:02:48.939> at<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.389> so<00:02:49.989> just<00:02:50.530> because<00:02:50.680> it

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
doesn't serve at all so just because it

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
doesn't serve at all so just because it
doesn't<00:02:51.250> absorb<00:02:51.430> doesn't<00:02:52.030> necessarily<00:02:52.659> mean

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
doesn't absorb doesn't necessarily mean

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.470 
doesn't absorb doesn't necessarily mean
it's<00:02:53.409> not<00:02:53.560> good<00:02:53.949> it<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.579> doesn't<00:02:54.909> feel<00:02:55.239> well

was actually some kind of acid so um so

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.929 
was actually some kind of acid so um so
unfortunately<00:06:01.099> like<00:06:01.189> my<00:06:01.370> friend<00:06:01.639> can't<00:06:01.819> use

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:01.939 
unfortunately like my friend can't use

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.730 
unfortunately like my friend can't use
it<00:06:02.060> because<00:06:02.089> she's<00:06:02.509> allergic<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.960> acid<00:06:03.529> but

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
it because she's allergic to acid but

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.209 
it because she's allergic to acid but
there<00:06:03.860> was<00:06:03.979> no<00:06:04.159> alcohol<00:06:04.460> in<00:06:04.939> that<00:06:04.969> at<00:06:05.330> all<00:06:05.389> so

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:06.219 
there was no alcohol in that at all so

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.499 
there was no alcohol in that at all so
and<00:06:07.219> I<00:06:07.490> think<00:06:07.580> he's<00:06:07.819> allergic<00:06:08.029> to<00:06:08.210> certain

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
and I think he's allergic to certain

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.079 
and I think he's allergic to certain
types<00:06:08.870> of<00:06:09.169> acid<00:06:09.680> so<00:06:09.860> this<00:06:10.490> one<00:06:10.669> is<00:06:10.939> not

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089 
types of acid so this one is not

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:13.209 
types of acid so this one is not
something<00:06:11.509> for<00:06:11.539> him<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.349> it<00:06:12.800> might<00:06:13.039> be

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
something for him and it might be

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.179 
something for him and it might be
something<00:06:13.669> for<00:06:13.819> you<00:06:14.029> but<00:06:14.389> I<00:06:15.169> want<00:06:15.620> to<00:06:15.680> say<00:06:15.860> this

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:16.189 
something for you but I want to say this

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.999 
something for you but I want to say this
bottle<00:06:16.669> like<00:06:17.000> the<00:06:17.210> cap<00:06:17.479> of<00:06:17.689> the<00:06:17.719> because<00:06:18.649> I

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
bottle like the cap of the because I

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.619 
bottle like the cap of the because I
talked<00:06:19.490> about<00:06:19.699> it'll<00:06:20.029> fill<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.419> I<00:06:20.479> was

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.629 
talked about it'll fill and I was

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:22.240 
talked about it'll fill and I was
talking<00:06:20.899> about<00:06:21.199> how<00:06:21.319> like<00:06:21.469> that<00:06:21.740> the

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
talking about how like that the

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.459 
talking about how like that the
packaging<00:06:22.729> like<00:06:22.879> it<00:06:23.029> pops<00:06:23.270> open<00:06:23.539> is<00:06:23.870> horrible

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
packaging like it pops open is horrible

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.939 
packaging like it pops open is horrible
but<00:06:25.629> acidophilus<00:06:26.629> actually<00:06:27.500> it<00:06:27.740> feels

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
but acidophilus actually it feels

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.250 
but acidophilus actually it feels
lighter<00:06:28.399> than<00:06:28.729> this

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
lighter than this

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.110 
lighter than this
feels<00:06:29.530> really<00:06:30.010> heavy<00:06:30.220> after<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.730> put<00:06:30.910> it<00:06:31.000> on

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
feels really heavy after you put it on

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.050 
feels really heavy after you put it on
so<00:06:31.660> it<00:06:31.930> says<00:06:32.230> it<00:06:32.560> helps<00:06:33.010> maintain<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.460> natural

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
so it says it helps maintain the natural

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.790 
so it says it helps maintain the natural
skin<00:06:34.330> protective<00:06:34.840> function<00:06:35.260> maybe<00:06:35.530> that's

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
skin protective function maybe that's

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.130 
skin protective function maybe that's
what<00:06:36.010> it's<00:06:36.130> trying<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.490> do<00:06:36.730> and<00:06:37.030> saying<00:06:37.900> like

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
what it's trying to do and saying like

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.860 
what it's trying to do and saying like
it's<00:06:38.320> supposed<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:39.040> penetrate<00:06:39.700> it<00:06:40.420> has

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
it's supposed to penetrate it has

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.170
