00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:11.139
 Hello and welcome to otv 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.680
 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:18.699
 the gopro hero 3 in normal mode films 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.490
 and in proton mode we have here 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.550
 a splitscreen you see on the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.070
 right side of the camera with proton 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.510
 activated and on the left side the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.510
 normal movie mode 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.220
 especially in dark areas you can see 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.710
 that the protein gets a little more 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.740
 it is a slightly contrasted image 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.240
 but it lacks the protein mode but 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.240
 also clearly sharp 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.080
 This is especially good if you look 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.220
 sometimes a motionless picture looks like that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.220
 how we do this 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.840
 if you look at 200% you can see the sheep 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.840
 loss quite clearly 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.440
 In contrast, proton offers advantages in the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.100
 postprocessing because here you can through 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.250
 the somewhat contrasting poorer picture 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 achieve a more balanced result 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.990
 to conclude here once again 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.750
 zoom receptive enlarged to 200 percent 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.000
 left you see the normal recording and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.000
 on the right the edited bread jun
