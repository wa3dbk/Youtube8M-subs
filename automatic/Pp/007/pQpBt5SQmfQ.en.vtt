00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:05.730 

so<00:00:01.959> let's<00:00:03.600> create<00:00:04.600> the<00:00:04.780> rest<00:00:04.990> of<00:00:05.200> the<00:00:05.290> images

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740 
so let's create the rest of the images

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:15.180 
so let's create the rest of the images
and<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:09.059> declare<00:00:10.059> more<00:00:11.039> variables<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:14.190> I'm

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
and I declare more variables and I'm

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.630 
and I declare more variables and I'm
going<00:00:15.400> to<00:00:15.429> create<00:00:15.700> one<00:00:16.030> for<00:00:16.360> my<00:00:17.290> arrow<00:00:17.650> though

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
going to create one for my arrow though

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.160 
going to create one for my arrow though
that's<00:00:19.210> gonna<00:00:19.360> those<00:00:19.630> are<00:00:19.750> going<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.900> be<00:00:19.960> the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
that's gonna those are going to be the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.930 
that's gonna those are going to be the
arrows<00:00:20.560> and<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:22.420> got<00:00:22.870> to<00:00:22.960> be<00:00:23.020> pretty<00:00:23.200> similar

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
arrows and it's got to be pretty similar

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.390 
arrows and it's got to be pretty similar
not<00:00:24.940> much<00:00:25.090> different<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:29.220> we're<00:00:30.220> going<00:00:30.370> to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
not much different and we're going to

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.860 
not much different and we're going to
type

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.860 

the<00:00:34.530> same<00:00:34.770> thing<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.090> create<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.480> texture

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the same thing is just create a texture

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.850 
the same thing is just create a texture
r<00:00:37.079> plus<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.530> 32<00:00:38.070> by<00:00:38.250> 32<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
r plus with 32 by 32 and this is the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.759 
r plus with 32 by 32 and this is the
size<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.250> 30<00:00:41.519> 10<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.210> pretty<00:00:42.769> pretty

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
size of 30 10 so that's pretty pretty

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.000 
size of 30 10 so that's pretty pretty
straightforward<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.839> create<00:00:46.140> same

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
straightforward and then you create same

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.810 
straightforward and then you create same
thing<00:00:47.629> create<00:00:48.629> from<00:00:48.930> asset<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.610> give

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
thing create from asset and you give

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.549 
thing create from asset and you give
this<00:00:53.149> texture<00:00:54.149> atlas<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.290> create

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this texture atlas and then you create

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.460 
this texture atlas and then you create
the<00:00:55.739> name<00:00:55.979> give<00:00:56.909> you<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> name<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.229> file

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
the name give you the name of the file

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.380 
the name give you the name of the file
and<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> put<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.430> 0-0<00:00:59.760> where<00:01:00.269> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and then you put it at 0-0 where you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.940 
and then you put it at 0-0 where you
want<00:01:00.540> to<00:01:00.600> put<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.399> ok<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.570> let's<00:01:03.570> load<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:05.660> the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
want to put it ok so let's load the the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.499 
want to put it ok so let's load the the
players<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:10.610> I'm<00:01:11.610> gonna<00:01:11.759> have<00:01:11.970> two<00:01:12.240> different

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
players and I'm gonna have two different

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.889 
players and I'm gonna have two different
players<00:01:15.649> 1<00:01:17.090> i'm<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.179> to<00:01:18.300> create<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> texture

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
players 1 i'm going to create a texture

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.560 
players 1 i'm going to create a texture
atlas<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.039> bigger<00:01:20.610> area<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.300> i'm<00:01:21.450> going

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
atlas that the bigger area and i'm going

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
atlas that the bigger area and i'm going
to<00:01:21.630> load<00:01:22.310> one<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:25.130> i'm<00:01:26.130> going

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to load one and the other one i'm going

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.859 
to load one and the other one i'm going
to<00:01:26.369> create<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> i'm<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> load<00:01:27.600> one

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to create this and i'm going to load one

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.800 
to create this and i'm going to load one
here<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.289> another<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.970> one<00:01:29.970> red<00:01:30.300> one

to go but I gonna be called player read
text<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.700> region<00:01:43.580> ok<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.459> that<00:01:47.700> by

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.640

new texture atlas 256 x 256 and we're

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
new texture atlas 256 x 256 and we're
gonna<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> load<00:02:07.039> I'm<00:02:08.039> gonna<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.369> rid<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
we're gonna have to import the tiled

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.690 
we're gonna have to import the tiled
text<00:02:18.540> your<00:02:18.660> region<00:02:18.959> because<00:02:19.700> that's

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
text your region because that's

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.509 
text your region because that's
different<00:02:21.269> than<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.530> regular<00:02:22.739> texture

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
different than just a regular texture

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.920 
different than just a regular texture
region<00:02:24.260> from<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
region from because this is a going to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.229 
region from because this is a going to
be<00:02:28.050> an<00:02:28.140> animated<00:02:28.709> sprite<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.880> these<00:02:30.180> are

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
be an animated sprite and this these are

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.320 
be an animated sprite and this these are
not<00:02:31.310> okay<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.500> basically<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.730> download

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
not okay so basically you just download

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.630 
not okay so basically you just download
this<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.720> same<00:02:36.989> way<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.430> go<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
this the same way this is going to go to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.120 
this the same way this is going to go to
the<00:02:38.940> top<00:02:39.120> left<00:02:39.180> corner<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.049> this<00:02:40.680> shows<00:02:41.100> how

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the top left corner and this shows how

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.350 
the top left corner and this shows how
many<00:02:41.730> columns<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.450> how<00:02:43.110> many<00:02:43.319> rows<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:44.010> has

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
many columns and how many rows this has

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.070 
many columns and how many rows this has
so<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> two<00:02:45.900> columns<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.750> four<00:02:48.750> rows

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
so this is two columns and four rows

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.729 
so this is two columns and four rows
here<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.180> go<00:02:51.560> 120<00:02:52.560> 80

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
here and this is going to go 120 80

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.370 
here and this is going to go 120 80
which<00:02:53.489> means<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.910> going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> go<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:55.200> this

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
which means it's going to go to this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.250 
which means it's going to go to this
position<00:02:56.030> instead<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.180> 0<00:02:57.390> 0<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:57.989> should<00:02:58.140> be

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
position instead of 0 0 we should be

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.190 
position instead of 0 0 we should be
that<00:02:58.440> position<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.239> it<00:03:00.239> also<00:03:00.390> has<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:03.200> two

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that position and it also has to two

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.030 
that position and it also has to two
columns<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.829> four<00:03:05.040> rows<00:03:06.350> okay<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> last

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
columns and four rows okay and the last

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979 
columns and four rows okay and the last
thing<00:03:08.310> we're<00:03:08.489> going<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.870> we're

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
thing we're going to have to do is we're

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.470 
thing we're going to have to do is we're
going<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.170> load<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.010> load<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.820> all<00:03:11.940> up<00:03:12.209> to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
going to load it all load it all up to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.020 
going to load it all load it all up to
the<00:03:12.510> engine<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.980> by<00:03:14.549> adding<00:03:14.760> this

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the engine so you do that by adding this

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.750 
the engine so you do that by adding this
following<00:03:15.450> line<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:17.160> dot<00:03:17.609> m<00:03:18.510> engine<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.760> I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
following line this dot m engine and I

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.569 
following line this dot m engine and I
did<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.750> declare<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.440> imagine<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.400> is

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
did not declare this imagine this is

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.830 
did not declare this imagine this is
inherited<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.690> why<00:03:24.930> i<00:03:25.290> use<00:03:25.799> my<00:03:26.840> everything

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
inherited that's why i use my everything

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.810 
inherited that's why i use my everything
everywhere<00:03:28.290> where<00:03:28.470> i<00:03:28.500> declare<00:03:29.070> something<00:03:29.400> i

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
everywhere where i declare something i

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.560 
everywhere where i declare something i
use<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.630> prefix<00:03:31.019> my<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.859> this<00:03:32.519> M<00:03:32.790> engine<00:03:33.359> I

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
use the prefix my and this M engine I

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.309 
use the prefix my and this M engine I
didn't<00:03:33.989> declare<00:03:34.920> that's<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:36.079> inherited<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:37.260> you

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
didn't declare that's a inherited so you

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.759 
didn't declare that's a inherited so you
just<00:03:37.530> type<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.690> line<00:03:39.690> image<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.290> get<00:03:40.440> text

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
just type this line image and get text

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.610 
just type this line image and get text
to<00:03:40.859> measure<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.519> low<00:03:41.880> textures<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:43.290> then<00:03:43.500> you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
to measure the low textures and then you

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.910 
to measure the low textures and then you
just<00:03:43.829> basically<00:03:44.359> give<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.480> all<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.930> texture

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
just basically give it all the texture

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.229 
just basically give it all the texture
atlases<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.670> we<00:03:47.819> used<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.950> I'll<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.670> from

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
atlases that we used and I'll and from

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.789 
atlases that we used and I'll and from
this<00:03:51.389> point<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:52.049> will<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.410> able<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.650> use

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
this point on we will be able to use

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.889 
this point on we will be able to use
these<00:03:53.190> are<00:03:53.519> images<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.780> our<00:03:55.319> program
