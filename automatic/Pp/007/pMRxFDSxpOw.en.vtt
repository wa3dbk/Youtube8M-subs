00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
these mean but it seems pretty pretty

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.729 
these mean but it seems pretty pretty
thorough<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.959> little<00:02:09.259> feature<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.649> can

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
thorough and this little feature you can

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.380 
thorough and this little feature you can
zoom<00:02:10.009> in<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.429> kind<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.670> pan<00:02:10.880> around<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.239> see

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
zoom in and kind of pan around to see

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.270 
zoom in and kind of pan around to see
what<00:02:11.540> they<00:02:11.660> look<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.890> change<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
what they look like you can change the

fonts<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.700> stuff<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.420> just

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
fonts and stuff in here but I just

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.620 
fonts and stuff in here but I just
thought<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.690> was<00:02:14.840> really<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:16.160> very<00:02:16.700> nice<00:02:16.970> little

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
thought it was really a very nice little

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.240 
thought it was really a very nice little
added<00:02:17.810> feature<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> whole<00:02:18.830> thing<00:02:19.069> just

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
added feature that the whole thing just

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.650 
added feature that the whole thing just
kind<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.550> automatically<00:02:20.030> will<00:02:20.270> mail<00:02:20.450> merge

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
kind of automatically will mail merge

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.190 
kind of automatically will mail merge
for<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.420> didn't<00:02:23.630> really<00:02:23.660> solve<00:02:23.959> my

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
for you but that didn't really solve my

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.809 
for you but that didn't really solve my
particular<00:02:24.560> problem<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.370> wanted<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
particular problem because I wanted to

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.729 
particular problem because I wanted to
create<00:02:26.600> something<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.760> cards<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:30.349> would<00:02:30.530> be

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
create something for cards that would be

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.809 
create something for cards that would be
you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:32.920> not<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.130> necessarily<00:02:34.640> an

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
you know not really necessarily an

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.190 
you know not really necessarily an
address<00:02:35.209> book<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.510> didn't<00:02:35.720> want<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.959> sit<00:02:36.110> around

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
address book I didn't want to sit around

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.059 
address book I didn't want to sit around
and<00:02:36.470> make<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:37.010> whole<00:02:37.850> bunch<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.650> address<00:02:39.650> cards

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
and make a whole bunch of address cards

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.009 
and make a whole bunch of address cards
for<00:02:40.310> these<00:02:40.370> these<00:02:40.850> cards<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.330> my<00:02:41.540> game<00:02:41.780> which

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
for these these cards for my game which

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.479 
for these these cards for my game which
is<00:02:42.170> kind<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.380> silly<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.769> looked<00:02:43.010> around<00:02:43.130> on

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
is kind of silly so I looked around on

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.430 
is kind of silly so I looked around on
the<00:02:43.610> net<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.209> found<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.690> couple<00:02:44.900> pieces<00:02:45.170> of

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the net and I found a couple pieces of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.670 
the net and I found a couple pieces of
software<00:02:45.769> if<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.459> are<00:02:46.850> curious<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:48.260> first

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
software if you are curious this first

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.979 
software if you are curious this first
one<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:53.350> label<00:02:54.350> now<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:56.239> looks<00:02:56.480> really<00:02:56.750> nice

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
one I label now this looks really nice

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.930 
one I label now this looks really nice
and<00:02:57.049> it<00:02:57.410> looks<00:02:57.590> like<00:02:57.650> something<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.640> would

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
and it looks like something that would

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.430 
and it looks like something that would
have<00:02:59.090> done<00:02:59.239> what<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> wanted<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.080> do

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
have done what I wanted it to do

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.009 
have done what I wanted it to do
but<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.970> $50<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.269> that's<00:03:02.660> kind<00:03:02.930> of

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
but it's $50 and that's kind of

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.800 
but it's $50 and that's kind of
ridiculous<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:04.160> my<00:03:04.190> opinion<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.970> mean<00:03:05.450> there's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
ridiculous in my opinion I mean there's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.300 
ridiculous in my opinion I mean there's
a<00:03:05.900> lots<00:03:06.109> of<00:03:06.260> software<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.890> Mac<00:03:06.920> that's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
a lots of software for the Mac that's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.190 
a lots of software for the Mac that's
like<00:03:07.459> 20<00:03:07.970> bucks<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.390> does<00:03:08.600> way<00:03:08.780> more<00:03:09.019> than

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
like 20 bucks that does way more than

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.759 
like 20 bucks that does way more than
just<00:03:09.230> print<00:03:09.590> labels<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:11.690> got<00:03:12.500> kind<00:03:12.680> of

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
just print labels so I just got kind of

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.160 
just print labels so I just got kind of
frustrated<00:03:13.340> with<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.630> was<00:03:14.780> fifty

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
frustrated with this that it was fifty

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.810 
frustrated with this that it was fifty
dollars<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.560> three<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.100> think<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.519> just

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
dollars that three I think is just

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.000 
dollars that three I think is just
ridiculous<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:18.049> more<00:03:18.320> power<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> guy<00:03:18.890> if

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
ridiculous and more power to the guy if

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.250 
ridiculous and more power to the guy if
he<00:03:19.100> can<00:03:19.280> sell<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.609> for<00:03:19.790> 50<00:03:20.060> bucks<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:21.019> mean

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
he can sell that for 50 bucks but I mean

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.259 
he can sell that for 50 bucks but I mean
I<00:03:21.530> work<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.220> get<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.400> whole<00:03:22.579> suite<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:22.970> things

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
I work you get a whole suite of things

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.479 
I work you get a whole suite of things
for<00:03:23.540> 79<00:03:24.079> there's<00:03:24.380> only<00:03:24.500> like<00:03:24.680> 20<00:03:25.100> bucks<00:03:25.220> more

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
for 79 there's only like 20 bucks more

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.920 
for 79 there's only like 20 bucks more
that's<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:25.820> three<00:03:26.090> Pro<00:03:26.239> added<00:03:26.510> up<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.810> just

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that's like three Pro added up it just

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.720 
that's like three Pro added up it just
seems<00:03:27.170> way<00:03:27.350> overpriced<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> looked<00:03:28.670> around

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
seems way overpriced so I looked around

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.370 
seems way overpriced so I looked around
a<00:03:28.940> little<00:03:29.000> bit<00:03:29.209> more<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.510> found<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.870> Avery

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
a little bit more and I found that Avery

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.220 
a little bit more and I found that Avery
itself<00:03:30.859> puts<00:03:31.190> out<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:32.390> software<00:03:33.079> application

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
itself puts out a software application

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.830 
itself puts out a software application
now<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.070> do<00:03:34.280> exactly<00:03:34.940> what<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.420> wanted<00:03:35.720> to

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
now that you do exactly what I wanted to

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.699 
now that you do exactly what I wanted to
do<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.709> imports<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.340> CDs<00:03:38.090> files<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.470> can

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
do in imports in CDs files and you can

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.069 
do in imports in CDs files and you can
design<00:03:40.040> based<00:03:40.609> on<00:03:40.820> Avery<00:03:41.570> templates<00:03:41.989> or

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
design based on Avery templates or

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.900 
design based on Avery templates or
whatever<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.799> can<00:03:42.950> print<00:03:43.160> out<00:03:43.280> and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
whatever and then you can print out and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.390 
whatever and then you can print out and
it<00:03:44.000> does<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.269> repeating<00:03:44.720> thing<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:46.310> works

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it does the repeating thing and it works

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.759 
it does the repeating thing and it works
really<00:03:46.640> well<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:47.660> doesn't<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.109> application

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
really well it doesn't the application

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.800 
really well it doesn't the application
itself<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.220> kind<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.459> funky<00:03:49.690> looking<00:03:50.690> because

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
itself is kind of funky looking because

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.800 
itself is kind of funky looking because
it's<00:03:51.049> carbon<00:03:51.680> instead<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.040> cocoa<00:03:52.430> or<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.359> cocoa

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
it's carbon instead of cocoa or a cocoa

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.340 
it's carbon instead of cocoa or a cocoa
but<00:03:54.819> whatever<00:03:55.819> it<00:03:55.970> works<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.510> it's<00:03:56.720> free

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
but whatever it works and it's free

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.009 
but whatever it works and it's free
which<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:58.250> bomb<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:58.819> there<00:03:59.720> it<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.900> right

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
which is the bomb so there it is right

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.690 
which is the bomb so there it is right
there<00:04:00.109> you<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.650> down<00:04:00.920> down<00:04:01.100> here<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.519> is

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
there you just down down here this is

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.629 
there you just down down here this is
the<00:04:01.730> URL<00:04:02.980> zoom<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.130> little<00:04:04.190> bit<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:04.519> you<00:04:04.609> can

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
the URL zoom in a little bit so you can

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.250 
the URL zoom in a little bit so you can
see<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:05.000> um<00:04:07.060> since<00:04:08.060> it's<00:04:08.330> in<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> UK<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.930> guess

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
see it um since it's in the UK I guess

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.710 
see it um since it's in the UK I guess
that's<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.590> only<00:04:09.980> available<00:04:10.129> in<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.519> UK

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
that's the only available in the UK

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.510 
that's the only available in the UK
I<00:04:11.780> don't<00:04:12.110> know<00:04:12.200> about<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.500> but<00:04:12.890> that's<00:04:13.250> where

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
I don't know about that but that's where

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.979 
I don't know about that but that's where
I<00:04:13.550> found<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:16.190> that's<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:17.209> it's<00:04:17.480> not<00:04:17.690> really

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
I found it so that's it it's not really

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.340 
I found it so that's it it's not really
