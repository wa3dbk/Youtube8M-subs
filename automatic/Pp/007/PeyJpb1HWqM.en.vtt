 welcome to innovate crafts in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 this new video I will show you how 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.849
 make these napkin containers 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.610
 of paper for sweets salty 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.600
 your parties 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.940
 We are going to need these materials 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.270
 colored paper napkins and a 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.270
 glass 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.700
 I recommend you use a napkin 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.350
 that is two seats in the event that 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.260
 your napkins are three layers 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.660
 you can take one 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.570
 we're going to open it and we're going to start 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.910
 bring all the corners to the center 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.550
 this step we are going to make a total of 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.550
 four times this would be the first double 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.760
 once finished the third double we go 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 to turn the napkin over and 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.140
 we continue with the room 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.260
 now we take a glass that is a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.090
 centimeter of the edge approximately and 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.090
 we are giving shape to the flower 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.440
 and we have finished we have an original 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.590
 container of sweets and snacks for 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.780
 our parties 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.879
