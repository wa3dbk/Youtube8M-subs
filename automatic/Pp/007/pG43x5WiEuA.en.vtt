 Welcome to Digital Digging. 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.120
 In this video we take a closer look at the Tier 2 - specifically the Russian T-34 1940 L-11. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.860
 When the T-34 L-11 first rolled off the production line in 1940, it significantly influenced the direction of future tank construction. 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.700
 When the Germans first met him, he was hopelessly superior to German technology in almost all technological parameters. 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 German tank general von Kleist and Guderian even called it "the most dangerous tank in the world". 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.600
 The biggest advantage of the T-34 was not simply the thickest armor, the highest maximum speed, the best dexterity or the best firepower, 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.780
 but in the effective balancing of all these elements - more than any other tank on the eastern front. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 The success of the early models, however, required additional treatment - with which the T-34 became the tank with the largest number of pieces produced in World War II. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:05.260
 The game has a T-34 1940 L11 combat efficiency (BR) 2.7 and a maximum speed of 49 kmh, which can reach within 7 seconds. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:17.420
 The maximum rotation of the tower is 15 degrees per second. The main weapon is the 76mm L-11 as well as the KV-1 - with 77 rounds and a 7.2 second charge. 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.600
 The tower's armor is 45mm thick all around the tower and 15mm on the roof deck. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:35.960
 The chassis's front armor is 45mm thick, the sides and back of the chassis are 40mm thick, and the 20mm reaches the roof plate. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:46.300
 Most ammunition is stored in the tank floor, but a small amount is also stored on the sides just below the tower, making it very vulnerable here. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.940
 Standard ammunition breaks 72mm armor at 100 meters, 65mm at 500 meters and 60mm at 1000 meters. 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.640
 This machine is the first T34 available in the game and we definitely recommend using it for as long as possible. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 On the high tier, the T-34 tanks are losing important armor protection against powerful German guns, and their main advantage is speed and dexterity. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.940
