decided to make more minecraft videos
because<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.250> first<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:27.289> was<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.439> popular

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
because my first one was so popular

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.179 
because my first one was so popular

with you just hit the trapdoor jump out

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.639 
with you just hit the trapdoor jump out
of<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.259> block<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.429> yeah<00:02:04.640> anyway<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.659> this<00:02:06.470> is

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
of that block so yeah anyway on this is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.109 
of that block so yeah anyway on this is
the<00:02:06.740> button<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.130> makes<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.459> go<00:02:07.640> down<00:02:07.789> from

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the button that makes it go down from

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:21.240 
the button that makes it go down from
here<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:12.140> that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.930 

there<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.370> go<00:02:22.550> see<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:23.720> i<00:02:24.020> am<00:02:24.290> at<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.710> top<00:02:24.950> I'm

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
there you go see now i am at the top I'm

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300 
there you go see now i am at the top I'm
not<00:02:26.660> really<00:02:26.900> completely<00:02:27.530> done<00:02:27.830> because<00:02:28.160> you

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
not really completely done because you

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.750 
not really completely done because you
can<00:02:28.460> look<00:02:28.640> over<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.030> see<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.450> red<00:02:30.110> stone<00:02:30.760> but

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
can look over and see the red stone but

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.050 
can look over and see the red stone but
yeah<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.540> am<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:34.010> at<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.400> top<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.060> I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
yeah I am now at the top of it and I

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.410 
yeah I am now at the top of it and I
think<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:38.630> turned<00:02:39.470> out<00:02:39.710> pretty<00:02:39.980> good<00:02:40.420> this

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
think it's turned out pretty good this

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.680 
think it's turned out pretty good this
is<00:02:41.770> definitely<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.430> best<00:02:43.640> elevator<00:02:44.270> might

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
is definitely the best elevator might

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.230 
is definitely the best elevator might
not<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> fastest<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.180> is

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
not be the fastest but I think this is

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.190 
not be the fastest but I think this is
really<00:02:47.660> cool<00:02:48.530> compared<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.810> everyone<00:02:50.810> else's

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
really cool compared to everyone else's

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.620 
really cool compared to everyone else's
that<00:02:51.440> I've<00:02:51.560> seen<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.980> YouTube<00:02:52.430> I've<00:02:53.060> tried<00:02:53.510> to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
that I've seen on YouTube I've tried to

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.920 
that I've seen on YouTube I've tried to
find<00:02:53.840> coal<00:02:54.110> elevators<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:56.600> is

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
find coal elevators it's just this is

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.520 
find coal elevators it's just this is
the<00:02:57.200> coolest<00:02:57.440> one<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.959> it's<00:02:59.959> pretty<00:03:00.290> much

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the coolest one and I it's pretty much

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.490 
the coolest one and I it's pretty much
my<00:03:00.830> invention<00:03:01.580> not<00:03:01.850> exactly<00:03:02.810> mine<00:03:03.140> because

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
my invention not exactly mine because

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.300 
my invention not exactly mine because
there<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> guy<00:03:04.670> from<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.090> computer

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
there is a guy from the computer

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.979 
there is a guy from the computer
whoo-hoo<00:03:07.310> like<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:08.000> kind<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.360> copied<00:03:08.690> off<00:03:08.780> his

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
whoo-hoo like I kind of copied off his

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.620 
whoo-hoo like I kind of copied off his
design<00:03:09.800> off<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.130> pc<00:03:10.550> but<00:03:10.790> I've<00:03:10.970> had<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> like

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
design off the pc but I've had to like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.400 
design off the pc but I've had to like
change<00:03:12.290> almost<00:03:13.840> everything<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:14.959> far<00:03:14.989> as<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
change almost everything as far as the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.170 
change almost everything as far as the
redstone<00:03:15.890> wiring<00:03:16.220> goes<00:03:17.080> because<00:03:18.970> we're<00:03:19.970> not

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
redstone wiring goes because we're not

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.750 
redstone wiring goes because we're not
up<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.540> date<00:03:20.690> with<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.930> computer<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.760> other

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
up to date with the computer and other

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.620 
up to date with the computer and other
than<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.830> piston<00:03:25.340> positions<00:03:26.180> it's

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
than like the piston positions it's

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.289 
than like the piston positions it's
pretty<00:03:27.080> much<00:03:27.260> my<00:03:27.500> design<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.970> want<00:03:32.180> to

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
pretty much my design so if you want to

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.090 
pretty much my design so if you want to
see<00:03:32.540> more<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.200> i<00:03:33.440> think<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.739> one<00:03:33.920> goes

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
see more of this i think this one goes

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.979 
see more of this i think this one goes
down<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.580> use<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:35.180> part<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.630> elevator

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
down of it use this part of the elevator

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.350 
down of it use this part of the elevator
much<00:03:36.489> if<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.580> want<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:37.910> more<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.180> this
