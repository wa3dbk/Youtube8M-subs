00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
to mix the katy formula for the babies

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.540 
to mix the katy formula for the babies
they<00:00:07.589> tell<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.010> make<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.250> look<00:00:08.400> like

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550

they tell you to make it look like
pudding<00:00:08.940> consistency<00:00:09.090> depending<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.230> age

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
pudding consistency depending on the age

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.860 
pudding consistency depending on the age
of<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.679> baby<00:00:10.940> these<00:00:11.940> babies<00:00:12.330> are<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.570> three

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
of the baby these babies are about three

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209 
of the baby these babies are about three
weeks<00:00:13.049> old<00:00:13.290> I'm<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> show<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.190> just

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
weeks old I'm going to show you in just

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.980 
weeks old I'm going to show you in just
a<00:00:14.429> minute<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.450> thick<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.809> should

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
a minute but this is how thick it should

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.710 
a minute but this is how thick it should
look<00:00:16.139> kind<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.710> pudding<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:18.300> maybe

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
look kind of like pudding or maybe

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.620 
look kind of like pudding or maybe
really<00:00:19.140> wet<00:00:19.380> mashed<00:00:19.770> potatoes<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.390> keep

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
really wet mashed potatoes and I keep

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.109 
really wet mashed potatoes and I keep
this<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.020> our<00:00:22.140> bowl<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.220> warm<00:00:23.460> water<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
this in our bowl of really warm water so

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
this in our bowl of really warm water so
that<00:00:24.300> doesn't<00:00:24.480> go<00:00:24.779> cold<00:00:25.019> because<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that doesn't go cold because then that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.950 
that doesn't go cold because then that
makes<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.189> crotch<00:00:26.460> move<00:00:27.180> slowly<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.840> then

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
makes the crotch move slowly and then

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
makes the crotch move slowly and then
they<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.230> end<00:00:28.410> up<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.650> an<00:00:28.769> infection<00:00:29.310> this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
they can end up with an infection this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.470 
they can end up with an infection this
is<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> exact<00:00:30.689> formula<00:00:31.140> Katy<00:00:32.270> all<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is the exact formula Katy all the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.709 
is the exact formula Katy all the
directions<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> back<00:00:34.440> follow<00:00:35.340> that

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
directions are on the back follow that

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
directions are on the back follow that
to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> tee<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.739> won't<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.129> well

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to the tee here you go you won't do well

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
to the tee here you go you won't do well
with<00:00:38.430> your<00:00:38.550> babies<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.649> was

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
with your babies and then it was

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.760 
with your babies and then it was
suggested<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.430> try<00:00:41.640> apple<00:00:41.969> cider<00:00:42.149> vinegar

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
suggested to try apple cider vinegar

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
suggested to try apple cider vinegar
because<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> helps<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> pH<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> gut

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because it helps with the pH and the gut

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.560 
because it helps with the pH and the gut
of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> baby<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.559> also<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.910> crop<00:00:48.210> as

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
of the baby and also in the the crop as

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
of the baby and also in the the crop as
far<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:49.020> digestion<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> everything<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
far as digestion and everything and you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
far as digestion and everything and you
wouldn't<00:00:51.120> try<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> organic<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.350> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wouldn't try to get the organic kind but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
wouldn't try to get the organic kind but
there's<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.280> call<00:00:53.550> something<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.120> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
there's they call something in here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
there's they call something in here
called<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> mother<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.590> stuff<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
called the mother of this stuff and it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220

like<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.789> clump<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> yuck<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
like a little clump of yuck it really

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
like a little clump of yuck it really
looks<00:00:58.440> gross<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.609> grab

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
mixture then that's going to help babies

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
mixture then that's going to help babies
and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.640> spirulina<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and then also spirulina and if you can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.899 
and then also spirulina and if you can
get<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.770> good<00:01:07.890> quality<00:01:08.250> organic

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

whatever this is kind of a green colored
stuff<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.010> beneficial

if<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.509> feeding<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> babies<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> see

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
if you're feeding the babies and you see

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
if you're feeding the babies and you see
the<00:01:19.890> crop<00:01:20.159> after<00:01:20.490> four<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:20.970> five<00:01:21.119> hours<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the crop after four or five hours of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.969 
the crop after four or five hours of
about<00:01:21.960> three<00:01:22.170> weeks<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.500> age<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.950> not

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
about three weeks of age it's not

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
about three weeks of age it's not
emptying<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:24.420> quickly<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.110> still<00:01:25.350> looks

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
emptying very quickly and it still looks

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
emptying very quickly and it still looks
like<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.100> ate<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> mix<00:01:27.290> half<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
like they just ate you can mix half of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.030 
like they just ate you can mix half of
the<00:01:28.619> formula<00:01:28.979> mixture<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.900> half<00:01:31.200> same

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the formula mixture here with half same

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
the formula mixture here with half same
amount<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> use<00:01:33.420> unsweetened

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
amount of the I use unsweetened

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.350 
amount of the I use unsweetened
applesauce<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.759> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.030> helps

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
applesauce and that just kind of helps

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.149 
applesauce and that just kind of helps
to<00:01:36.540> move<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> food<00:01:37.170> through<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.619> helps

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
to move the food through and helps

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
to move the food through and helps
balance<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.670> pH<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.210> their<00:01:39.360> little<00:01:39.509> crop

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
balance the pH and their little crop
