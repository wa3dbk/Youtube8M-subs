 things and she decided to donate to all 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.360
 the world's hottest museums 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.570

 immortal 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 regardless of the distance in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 they feel the presence of him and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.150
 her the moment she watches 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 some parts of the museum she feels 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.740
 and begins to feel desperate. 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.939
 because she knows he's going to see the candle 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.680
 to get revenge 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.610
 after all wool 200 years 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.079
 jonata's agenda and had said that the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.520
 hence he was one of the worst villains so the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.140
 The things he did are terrible. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 at the beginning of this book he makes some 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.850
 things that are horrible and start to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 seeks to bring comfort only 200 years 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.250
 arrested he has nothing else has no more 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 money does something pretty awful for 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.569
 being rich again is marked 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.769
 it is the end 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.620
 but I hated him 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.349
 I have had moments in this book where I 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.650
 I hated and I loved a love relationship. 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.189
 and hate him because you will understand 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.519
 reading this beautiful in the wide of souls to the 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.090
 primary focus is on the law and in 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.090
 on here 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.170
 beyond it the focus was going too much for the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.200
 Hawaii 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.689
 She is the author and has managed to transform a villain. 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.439
 and a person that you to think about and 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.919
 speak 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:52.329
 he may have a second chance because 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:54.790
 he is working gaffe to avenge but to the 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.269
 same time he 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.959
 he realizes that he nurtures a feeling 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:06.849
 through it he realizes that he is loving 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.969
 alan and he does not know what he can do to 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.389
 find out if he will kill there or 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:16.239
 if he will stay with her and the author 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.150
 again has the flash some continue 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.220
 some flashbacks here but few are 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.419
 but there is one that is too long I thought 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.310
 it was not necessary to count so much 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.709
 in this link here because there we went 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.780
 presented to the past in the book the thief 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.739
 of classes and if those who did not have as much 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.049
 need it 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.759
 At this point there is a capsule really 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.959
 lost points 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:44.169
 At this point I do little but I confess that 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.680
 This league that left me like this without sleep. 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:50.800
 the days in control because while I 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.570
 I did not finish both 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.860
 not that these arrivals and I confess that 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.530
 I'm calmer but when the fluminense 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.270
 here I am desperate for the next 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.040
 because it was once in the United States and 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.760
 I do not know why in Brazil. 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.770
 This delay in releasing the books is something 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.430
 I find it very interesting here. 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.460
 after he finds her 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.320
 He realizes that he really loves me and he loves me. 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.480
 will have to learn to deal with this 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.530
 feeling because he never knew how to love 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.850
 nobody 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.290
 he has always been very iser avelar boninho 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.770
 the whole family sees here I was 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.140
 annoyed kalani was enjoying the avaÃ­ 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.860
 How crazy is the robbery of 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:43.300
 souls hating him and speaking our legend 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.280
 you crazy me to do what she did and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.680
 ends silva spoke our struggle 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.590
 Why are you doing this and enjoying the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.980
 The attitude he had is complicated. 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.919
 coiled is also difficult does not spoiler 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.160
 in comma much that happens that 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.510
 related to that book and is even 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.550
 that I spoke that book 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.570
 choice of this one I do not intend to do 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.750
 that 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.210
 My final considerations I found the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.740
 really really good story a lot 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.860
 different from what I usually read and 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.050
 I strongly recommend these books. 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.330
 here at the same moment that it relaunches 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.290
 last Sunday there will not be any 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.410
 thing to do with being added at last is 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:33.220
 one are books that I recommend I already 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.680
 I checked with my favorites of 2014 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.050
 Yes, it's an engaging story. 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.290
 different these books here are mine 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.010
 economic issues the documents the covers 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:49.320
 are in the winemaking area are embossed 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:52.540
 those eyes in that mouth that the covers are 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.169
 Beautiful pretty beautiful and my books 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.450
 This author here congratulations. 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:03.050
 you have to have some caveats that 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.550
 she comes back to last year 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.740
 I thought she could 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.139
 save in history and direct in 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.360
 I was going to tell but the characters are well 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:16.430
 building are well planned and I hope 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.220
 that you have fun with is mainly how 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.500
 invest and let's wait for the last book 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.970
 I'm very very anxious not to 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.759
 I see the moment when he leaves 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.129
 I really only hope she gets it. 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.289
 have a good outcome because sometimes the 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:33.289
 people like both a beautiful and the final 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.389
 just falling short 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.849
 so this is what I hope you have
