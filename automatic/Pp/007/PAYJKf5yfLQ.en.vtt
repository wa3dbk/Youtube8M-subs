00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.500 

starting<00:00:19.070> with<00:00:19.160> green<00:00:19.460> make<00:00:19.700> eleven<00:00:20.240> green

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
starting with green make eleven green

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.790 
starting with green make eleven green
pairs<00:00:21.520> so<00:00:22.520> you<00:00:22.550> take<00:00:22.850> two<00:00:23.030> pieces<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:24.410> connect

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
pairs so you take two pieces and connect

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.940 
pairs so you take two pieces and connect
them<00:00:24.890> together<00:00:25.100> like<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:25.370> and<00:00:32.680> with<00:00:33.680> white

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
them together like this and with white

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.850 
them together like this and with white
you<00:00:34.130> make<00:00:34.340> two<00:00:34.640> white<00:00:34.970> pins<00:00:38.290> now<00:00:39.290> connect<00:00:39.680> two

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
you make two white pins now connect two

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.619 
you make two white pins now connect two
white<00:00:40.190> ones<00:00:40.430> with<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.970> green<00:00:41.180> one<00:00:41.360> in<00:00:41.540> the

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
white ones with the green one in the

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.390 
white ones with the green one in the
middle<00:00:44.500> then<00:00:45.500> connect<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.980> rest<00:00:46.129> of<00:00:46.309> the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
middle then connect the rest of the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.670 
middle then connect the rest of the
green<00:00:46.580> ones<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:50.720> can<00:00:50.870> connect<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.320> white<00:00:51.470> and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
green ones you can connect the white and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.940 
green ones you can connect the white and
green<00:00:51.800> together<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:57.350> know<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.620> weight<00:00:57.800> is

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
green together you know the weight is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.700 
green together you know the weight is
going<00:00:58.130> to<00:00:58.250> go<00:00:58.340> out<00:00:58.520> diagonally<00:00:59.260> so<00:01:00.260> on<00:01:00.500> this

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
going to go out diagonally so on this

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.819 
going to go out diagonally so on this
one<00:01:01.210> replace<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.420> green<00:01:02.600> with<00:01:02.780> white<00:01:03.020> and

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
one replace the green with white and

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.499 
one replace the green with white and
then<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.970> one<00:01:05.119> over<00:01:05.390> here<00:01:05.600> with<00:01:05.780> green<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
then the one over here with green so the

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.090 
then the one over here with green so the
white<00:01:08.660> stripes<00:01:09.020> are<00:01:09.229> going<00:01:09.259> out<00:01:09.560> diagonally

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
white stripes are going out diagonally

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.910 
white stripes are going out diagonally
so<00:01:10.940> Knicks<00:01:11.240> they're<00:01:11.450> going<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.690> go<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.680> add
