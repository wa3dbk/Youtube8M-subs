00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
test like a bunch so this you see me

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.149 
test like a bunch so this you see me
running<00:03:28.019> through<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.290> actually<00:03:28.739> relatively

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
running through this actually relatively

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.520 
running through this actually relatively
quickly<00:03:29.489> because<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:30.299> had<00:03:31.019> done<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.379> few

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
quickly because I had done it a few

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.349 
quickly because I had done it a few
times<00:03:31.739> right<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.849> is<00:03:32.970> an<00:03:33.030> example<00:03:33.239> of

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
times right like this is an example of

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.339 
times right like this is an example of
what<00:03:33.480> I'm<00:03:33.540> talking<00:03:33.599> about<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.109> have<00:03:34.260> to

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
what I'm talking about like you have to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.839 
what I'm talking about like you have to
put<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> button<00:03:34.829> I<00:03:34.859> put<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.489> cube<00:03:35.669> on<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
put the button I put the cube on the

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.099 
put the button I put the cube on the
button<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> go<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.359> other<00:03:36.449> room<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
button to go in the other room to get to

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.539 
button to go in the other room to get to
the<00:03:37.199> goo<00:03:37.319> portal<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.829> then<00:03:37.919> put<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.370> goo

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the goo portal and then put the goo

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.430 
the goo portal and then put the goo
portal<00:03:38.879> back<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.449> other<00:03:39.659> room<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.379> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
portal back into the other room of a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.839 
portal back into the other room of a
jump<00:03:40.680> pad<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:40.980> jump<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.340> through<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.579> portal

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
jump pad to jump up through the portal

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.069 
jump pad to jump up through the portal
so<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:41.970> get<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.150> cube<00:03:42.359> into<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.599> second<00:03:42.930> room

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
so you get the cube into the second room

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.649 
so you get the cube into the second room
she<00:03:43.319> create<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> lot<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.389> this<00:03:45.479> is

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
she create like a lot this and this is

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.229 
she create like a lot this and this is
the<00:03:46.159> first<00:03:47.159> puzzle<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.729> they<00:03:47.849> throw<00:03:48.060> it

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
the first puzzle that they throw it

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.789 
the first puzzle that they throw it
really<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.049> like<00:03:49.169> really<00:03:49.349> number<00:03:49.650> one

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
really this is like really number one

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.830 
really this is like really number one
yeah<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.609> they<00:03:50.760> are<00:03:50.909> expect<00:03:51.419> well<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:51.659> there's

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
yeah so they are expect well now there's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.599 
yeah so they are expect well now there's
like<00:03:51.959> some<00:03:52.199> few<00:03:52.889> things<00:03:53.069> this<00:03:53.159> is<00:03:53.310> there's

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
like some few things this is there's

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.189 
like some few things this is there's
like<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> puzzle<00:03:54.030> sphere<00:03:54.449> that<00:03:54.629> you<00:03:54.720> get<00:03:54.900> thrown

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
like a puzzle sphere that you get thrown

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.589 
like a puzzle sphere that you get thrown
into<00:03:55.409> this<00:03:56.010> game<00:03:56.220> expects<00:03:56.909> that<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.209> are<00:03:57.389> like

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
into this game expects that you are like

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.280 
into this game expects that you are like
really<00:03:58.349> really<00:03:58.709> really<00:03:58.889> good<00:03:59.250> at<00:03:59.629> portal<00:04:00.629> and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
really really really good at portal and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.890 
really really really good at portal and
and<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:02.519> great<00:04:02.819> because<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.419> it's

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
and the it's great because like it's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.629 
and the it's great because like it's
obviously<00:04:04.229> not<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:04.620> big<00:04:04.979> as<00:04:05.159> portal<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.489> think

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
obviously not as big as portal I think

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.369 
obviously not as big as portal I think
it's<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:05.849> five<00:04:06.090> chapters<00:04:06.569> which<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:06.900> pretty

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
it's like five chapters which is pretty

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.039 
it's like five chapters which is pretty
pretty<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:08.040> know<00:04:08.159> big<00:04:08.669> for<00:04:08.909> a<00:04:08.940> game<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> this

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
pretty you know big for a game of this

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.099 
pretty you know big for a game of this
of<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.979> know<00:04:11.099> type<00:04:11.840> but<00:04:12.840> you're<00:04:12.989> gonna

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
of this you know type but you're gonna

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.750 
of this you know type but you're gonna
take<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.889> long<00:04:14.069> getting<00:04:14.370> through<00:04:14.609> it

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
take just as long getting through it

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.610 
take just as long getting through it
because<00:04:15.090> these<00:04:15.239> tests<00:04:15.629> are<00:04:15.889> so<00:04:16.889> so<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:17.820> hard

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
because these tests are so so so hard

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.379 
because these tests are so so so hard
and<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.159> I<00:04:20.549> don't<00:04:20.699> know<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.269> really

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
and and I don't know it's it's really

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.700 
and and I don't know it's it's really
rewarding<00:04:21.779> when<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.380> figure<00:04:22.590> out

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
rewarding when you can figure out

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.409 
rewarding when you can figure out
exactly<00:04:23.159> how<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.370> do<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.029> there<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.210> made<00:04:24.389> a

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
exactly how to do it so there I made a

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.450 
exactly how to do it so there I made a
runway<00:04:24.659> with<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.050> launch<00:04:25.289> pad<00:04:25.529> to<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.860> you

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
runway with a launch pad to be in you

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.890 
runway with a launch pad to be in you
gotta<00:04:26.610> you

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
gotta you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
gotta you
to<00:04:27.169> get<00:04:27.320> over<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.710> pillar<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.430> then<00:04:28.520> you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
to get over to this pillar and then you

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.760 
to get over to this pillar and then you
use<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:29.330> put<00:04:29.509> blue<00:04:29.900> goo<00:04:30.169> down<00:04:30.440> on<00:04:30.590> this

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
use that to put blue goo down on this

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.439 
use that to put blue goo down on this
pillar<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.340> create<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.699> portal<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.270> can

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
pillar and create a portal that you can

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.939 
pillar and create a portal that you can
jump<00:04:32.660> through<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.110> then<00:04:33.620> once<00:04:33.770> you've<00:04:33.919> got

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
jump through and then once you've got

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.740 
jump through and then once you've got
back<00:04:34.280> going<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.699> can<00:04:34.850> jump<00:04:35.060> back<00:04:35.210> through<00:04:35.570> it

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
back going you can jump back through it

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.379 
back going you can jump back through it
and<00:04:35.900> then<00:04:36.380> create<00:04:36.770> like<00:04:36.979> a<00:04:37.009> like<00:04:37.789> portal<00:04:38.180> for

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
and then create like a like portal for

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.360 
and then create like a like portal for
you<00:04:38.509> to<00:04:38.600> like<00:04:38.780> launch<00:04:39.139> yourself<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:39.979> it's

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
you to like launch yourself to it's it's

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.820 
you to like launch yourself to it's it's
in<00:04:40.610> Santa<00:04:41.300> like<00:04:41.449> lost<00:04:41.780> perspective<00:04:42.229> for<00:04:42.800> a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
in Santa like lost perspective for a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.580 
in Santa like lost perspective for a
minute<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.160> up<00:04:43.580> was<00:04:43.789> down<00:04:44.139> it's<00:04:45.139> at<00:04:45.259> no<00:04:45.350> kidding

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
minute I up was down it's at no kidding

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.050 
minute I up was down it's at no kidding
like<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.830> when<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.280> was<00:04:46.400> editing<00:04:46.639> this<00:04:46.759> video<00:04:47.030> I

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
like I when I was editing this video I

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.400 
like I when I was editing this video I
was<00:04:47.180> trying<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.600> remember<00:04:47.870> like<00:04:48.229> it's

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
was trying to remember like it's

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.689 
was trying to remember like it's
probably<00:04:48.530> very<00:04:48.800> disorienting<00:04:49.370> watching<00:04:49.610> this

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
probably very disorienting watching this

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.580 
probably very disorienting watching this
now<00:04:49.880> but<00:04:50.419> when<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.810> was<00:04:50.960> editing<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.320> video<00:04:51.530> I
