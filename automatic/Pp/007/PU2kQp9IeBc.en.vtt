for<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:07.980> example<00:00:08.370> we're<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> use<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
for this example we're going to use a

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.560 
for this example we're going to use a
Shimano<00:00:10.290> Tegra<00:00:10.769> 6,700<00:00:11.730> front<00:00:11.969> derailleur<00:00:12.210> but

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
Shimano Tegra 6,700 front derailleur but

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.410 
Shimano Tegra 6,700 front derailleur but
it<00:00:12.690> doesn't<00:00:12.960> matter<00:00:13.400> which<00:00:14.400> type<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> any

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
it doesn't matter which type it is any

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.090 
it doesn't matter which type it is any
di2<00:00:15.870> front<00:00:16.289> derailleur<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.980> adjust

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
di2 front derailleur is going to adjust

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.640 
di2 front derailleur is going to adjust
using<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> same<00:00:18.090> procedures<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> first

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
using the same procedures so the first

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
using the same procedures so the first
step<00:00:19.859> we're<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.820> adjust<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
step we're going to do is adjust the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.939 
step we're going to do is adjust the
height<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> derailleur<00:00:22.140> we're<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
height of the derailleur we're going to

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.279 
height of the derailleur we're going to
want<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.279> cage<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.080> three

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
want this cage to be one to three

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.820 
want this cage to be one to three
millimeters<00:00:25.890> off<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.660> top<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.439> these

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
millimeters off of the top of these

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
millimeters off of the top of these
teeth<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.939> one's<00:00:30.119> set<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> little

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
teeth so this one's set up just a little

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
teeth so this one's set up just a little
bit<00:00:30.960> high<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.769> we're<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> lower<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.430> by

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
bit high so we're going to lower it by

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
bit high so we're going to lower it by
using<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.750> five<00:00:33.989> millimeter<00:00:34.410> allen<00:00:34.500> wrench<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
using a five millimeter allen wrench and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.959 
using a five millimeter allen wrench and
loosening<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.570> anchor<00:00:37.079> bolt<00:00:37.850> dropping<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
loosening this anchor bolt dropping the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.380 
loosening this anchor bolt dropping the
derailleur<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.500> touch<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> right

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
derailleur down just a touch so right

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
derailleur down just a touch so right
there<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.129> one<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> half

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
there we're at about one and a half

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.450 
there we're at about one and a half
millimeters<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> err<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
millimeters I kind of like to err on the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.990 
millimeters I kind of like to err on the
close<00:00:48.329> side<00:00:48.829> tighten<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:50.070> good<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
close side tighten it down good there so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
close side tighten it down good there so
the<00:00:51.149> next<00:00:51.360> step<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.930> adjust<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.500> angle<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the next step is to adjust the angle of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.790 
the next step is to adjust the angle of
the<00:00:53.460> cage<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.570> outer<00:00:55.110> cage<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the cage and we want this outer cage to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
the cage and we want this outer cage to
be<00:00:55.890> parallel<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> chain<00:00:57.570> ring<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> way

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
be parallel with this chain ring the way

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
be parallel with this chain ring the way
that<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> use<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> two

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that we do that is to use a two

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
that we do that is to use a two
millimeter<00:00:59.670> allen<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> small<00:01:01.170> set

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
millimeter allen there's a small set

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
millimeter allen there's a small set
screw<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:02.010> deep<00:01:02.730> within<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.449> derailleur

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
screw that's deep within the derailleur

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.149 
screw that's deep within the derailleur
here<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.830> accessed<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:07.070> kind<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
here it's accessed right in here kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.210 
here it's accessed right in here kind of
hard<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:09.049> black<00:01:11.270> now<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:13.650> presses<00:01:14.070> up

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
hard to see black now that presses up

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
hard to see black now that presses up
against<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> Bray's<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.229> turn<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
against the Bray's on and as we turn it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.310 
against the Bray's on and as we turn it
here<00:01:16.770> you'll<00:01:16.950> start<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.869> derailleur

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
here you'll start to see the derailleur

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
here you'll start to see the derailleur
start<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.100> kick<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:22.070> we'll<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.100> stop<00:01:23.460> once

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
start to kick out we'll just stop once

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.990 
start to kick out we'll just stop once
we<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.390> lined<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.790> there

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
we get it lined up right there

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.179 
we get it lined up right there
now<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.600> important<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.500> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
now it's important that you do this so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.260 
now it's important that you do this so
that<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> derailleur<00:01:29.820> has<00:01:29.970> something<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that the derailleur has something to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
that the derailleur has something to
push<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> shifts<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
push off of when it shifts and this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
push off of when it shifts and this
adjustment<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.310> only<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.820> made<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
adjustment can only be made when the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510 
adjustment can only be made when the
derailleur<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> smaller<00:01:34.950> chain<00:01:35.310> ring

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
derailleur is in the smaller chain ring

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
derailleur is in the smaller chain ring
next<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> need<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.780> adjust<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.290> inner<00:01:37.530> limit

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
next we need to adjust the inner limit

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
next we need to adjust the inner limit
screw<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> outside

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
screw that's right here on the outside

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.350 
screw that's right here on the outside
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> derailleur<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.060> our<00:01:42.210> two

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
of the derailleur put in our two

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719 
of the derailleur put in our two
millimeter<00:01:42.840> allen<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.439> turn<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> until<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
millimeter allen and turn it until the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.999 
millimeter allen and turn it until the
inner<00:01:44.909> cage<00:01:45.290> gets<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.649> next<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
inner cage gets right up next to the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
inner cage gets right up next to the
chain<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.700> close<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.180> possible<00:01:48.240> without

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
chain as close as possible without

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.800 
chain as close as possible without
actually<00:01:49.140> touching<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:51.090> last<00:01:51.360> step<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
actually touching the last step is to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.530 
actually touching the last step is to
adjust<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.500> upper<00:01:52.530> limit<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
adjust the upper limit that's on this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.649 
adjust the upper limit that's on this
small<00:01:54.899> screw<00:01:55.200> marked<00:01:55.470> H<00:01:56.450> we're<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
small screw marked H we're going to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
small screw marked H we're going to
bring<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.049> outer<00:01:58.560> cage<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.700> as

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
bring that outer cage in so that it's as

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
bring that outer cage in so that it's as
close<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> chain<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.110> possible<00:02:01.170> without

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
close to the chain as possible without

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.550 
close to the chain as possible without
touching<00:02:02.570> all<00:02:03.570> right<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.049> we'll<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.229> go

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
touching all right so now we'll just go

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.709 
touching all right so now we'll just go
through<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> shifting<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:06.540> make<00:02:06.689> sure

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
through the shifting and just make sure

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
through the shifting and just make sure
everything's<00:02:07.290> working<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.890> we'll<00:02:08.759> go<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
everything's working right we'll go to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.809 
everything's working right we'll go to
both<00:02:09.420> extremes

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
both extremes

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.509 
both extremes
and<00:02:10.939> both<00:02:11.870> rings<00:02:12.260> make<00:02:12.650> sure<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.069> it's<00:02:13.250> still

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
and both rings make sure that it's still

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:22.270 
and both rings make sure that it's still
shifting<00:02:20.200> I'm<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.409> checking<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.099> make<00:02:22.129> sure

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
shifting I'm just checking to make sure

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.309 
shifting I'm just checking to make sure
the<00:02:22.549> chain<00:02:22.760> isn't<00:02:22.970> dropping<00:02:23.480> off<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.930> inside

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the chain isn't dropping off the inside

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.600 
the chain isn't dropping off the inside
or<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.560> outside<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.430> we're<00:02:25.579> still

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
or the outside and that we're still

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.729 
or the outside and that we're still
getting<00:02:26.000> smooth<00:02:26.239> shifts<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:27.379> this<00:02:27.560> one's

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
getting smooth shifts and this one's

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.420 
getting smooth shifts and this one's
good<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.040> go

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
good to go

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
good to go
so<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.150> how<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.360> adjust<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.810> Shimano<00:02:30.170> di2

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
so that's how to adjust a Shimano di2

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.050 
so that's how to adjust a Shimano di2
