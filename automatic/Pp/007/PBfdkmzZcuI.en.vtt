today
so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> thought<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> review<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so I thought I would do a review on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
so I thought I would do a review on the
both<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.549> while<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> this

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
both of them while I was at it this

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.969 
both of them while I was at it this
one's<00:01:28.530> made<00:01:28.799> by<00:01:29.100> elf<00:01:29.490> monkey<00:01:30.200> which<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.650> can't

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
one's made by elf monkey which I can't

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
one's made by elf monkey which I can't
say<00:01:32.130> I've<00:01:32.250> heard<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.610> brand<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.299> I'll

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
say I've heard of that brand but I'll

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.859 
say I've heard of that brand but I'll
definitely<00:01:34.520> go<00:01:35.520> check<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.970> their<00:01:36.180> website<00:01:36.659> if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
definitely go check out their website if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.149 
definitely go check out their website if
they<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.400> tactical<00:01:39.060> knife<00:01:40.159> on

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
they have one it's a tactical knife on

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.030 
they have one it's a tactical knife on
the<00:01:41.400> end<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:43.040> it's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the end of it you can see there it's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.149 
the end of it you can see there it's
like<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:46.290> could<00:01:46.439> either<00:01:46.560> hit

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
like a little point you could either hit

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.420 
like a little point you could either hit
somebody<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:49.799> instance<00:01:49.979> if

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
somebody with that or for instance if

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
somebody with that or for instance if
you<00:01:50.549> were<00:01:50.670> trapped<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> car<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.899> water

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you were trapped in a car with water

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
you were trapped in a car with water
gushing<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.310> something<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
gushing in or something like that you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
gushing in or something like that you
could<00:01:55.049> most<00:01:55.409> likely<00:01:55.530> break<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> window<00:01:56.579> at<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
could most likely break a window at that

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
could most likely break a window at that
point

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
point

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.490 
point
got<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> nice<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.520> point<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.500> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
got a nice little point on it but it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
got a nice little point on it but it's
very<00:02:01.770> well<00:02:01.920> built<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.969> has<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> little

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
very well built actually has a little

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.570 
very well built actually has a little
bit<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.659> weight<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:05.009> real

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
bit of weight to it it's real

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.420 
bit of weight to it it's real
