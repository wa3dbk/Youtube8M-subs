00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:26.760
 become a canvas case and created a lesson 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.210
 start now we find capture and raid 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.890
 loaders 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:42.270
 yes, we are creating this map at home 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:44.730
 confidently now when we create 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.360
 card we will need to call one 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.640

 wait for him to come in now when she 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 suddenly went into the game we are not the first thing 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.230
 must go for a helicopter he 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.460
 is in the middle of the map pledged where 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.540
 your base is now before it 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.330
 let's get there and take and I'll show you what to do 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.220
 farther 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:41.520
 bridges and a helicopter and there will be further 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.060
 be an enemy base sit down 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060
 helicopter 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.660
 you are already my friend 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.490
 and now we are flying to the enemy base and to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.490
 pick up a case 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.900
 then so much easier like this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 now run for the case 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:22.610
 and we return to our base we return 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.940
 helicopter so why doesn't he sit down all 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.940
 sit down 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.650
 Now we return to our base as 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.020
 You can make a note now and 41 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:49.160
 level and see how fast you can 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:54.380
 swing so he for beams style we fly 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.740
 to our base to this blue house but not 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.740
 land completely and right about 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:08.270
 100 meters five above landing above the ground 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.250
 caution so when we land a little 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.470
 lower down 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.490
 and here's the process went points are awarded 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.610
 need to be in this state 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.870
 soar above our base but do not touch 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:28.280
 otherwise if you touch to this will 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.709
 how is it that you brought it 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.360
 here's the 10 minutes of the whole match you 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.400
 can soar and swing your level 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:44.570
 then right now except the hive now 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:46.630
 forty second level was 41 ie this 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.650
 pretty fast you can pump 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.200
 if you don't want to waste time on 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.440
 passing the mission for which incidentally 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.270
 pretty little give experience then you can 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 This is the way to pump up 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.670
 one hundredth level no you want so here 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.590
 flew too low 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:09.950
 and the layout was counted here is level 43 so 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.840
 what if you want to pump fast 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.340

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.440
