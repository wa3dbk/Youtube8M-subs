00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
well just sort of have a look cuz I'm

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.910 
well just sort of have a look cuz I'm
I'm<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.910> bit<00:03:06.180> skeptical<00:03:06.660> about<00:03:06.840> avon<00:03:07.620> products

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
I'm a bit skeptical about avon products

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.070

so<00:03:08.220> they<00:03:08.250> look<00:03:08.550> good<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.780> don't<00:03:09.990> really

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080

that<00:03:52.740> I've<00:03:52.860> been<00:03:53.070> going<00:03:53.400> back<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:56.040> an

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that I've been going back to is this an

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.660 
that I've been going back to is this an
isolated<00:03:57.300> this<00:03:58.110> mega<00:03:58.530> on<00:03:58.950> one<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.460> my<00:03:59.610> other

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
isolated this mega on one of my other

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.120 
isolated this mega on one of my other

videos I said it was clumpy disgusting
but<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:03.060> that's<00:04:03.240> just<00:04:03.450> because<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:04.200> was

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
but I think that's just because I was

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.240 
but I think that's just because I was
used<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.150> my<00:04:06.150> Maybelline<00:04:06.630> forties<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.410> with

that you can build it quite a lot

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.510 
that you can build it quite a lot
because<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.000> not<00:04:12.300> as<00:04:12.860> it's<00:04:13.860> more<00:04:14.130> dryer

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
it really really lightly so i usually

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.520 
it really really lightly so i usually
put<00:04:47.010> loads<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.490> pressure<00:04:47.730> on<00:04:47.880> my<00:04:48.120> lashes<00:04:48.530> but
