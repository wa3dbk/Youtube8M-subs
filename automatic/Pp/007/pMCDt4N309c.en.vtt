this<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.240> my<00:00:34.600> main<00:00:35.140> loop<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:36.130> chain<00:00:36.160> that's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
this is my main loop of chain that's

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.090 
this is my main loop of chain that's
going<00:00:37.060> to<00:00:37.120> go<00:00:37.270> around<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.600> body<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:38.710> one

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
going to go around the body this one

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.630 
going to go around the body this one
will<00:00:39.580> be<00:00:39.730> going<00:00:40.060> down<00:00:40.270> my<00:00:40.630> back<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.640> we're

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
will be going down my back and we're

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.770 
will be going down my back and we're
going<00:00:42.880> to<00:00:43.000> begin<00:00:43.150> by<00:00:44.280> taping<00:00:45.280> down<00:00:45.490> the<00:00:46.180> top<00:00:46.450> of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
going to begin by taping down the top of

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.180 
going to begin by taping down the top of
the<00:00:47.170> chain<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.960> taping<00:00:50.170> down<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.680> top<00:00:50.890> part

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
the chain we're taping down the top part

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.560 
the chain we're taping down the top part
of<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.540> back<00:00:52.540> chain<00:00:52.930> because<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.820> part<00:00:55.239> we

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
of the back chain because this part we

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.610 
of the back chain because this part we
will<00:00:55.840> need<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:57.129> bring<00:00:57.370> down<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.350> we<00:00:59.470> don't

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
will need to bring down and we don't

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.130 
will need to bring down and we don't
want<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.980> tape<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.610> struck<00:01:01.450> dust<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.050> I'm

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
want the tape to struck dust so I'm

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.469 
want the tape to struck dust so I'm
going<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.440> start<00:01:02.770> by<00:01:02.920> measuring<00:01:03.460> 13<00:01:04.150> inches

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
going to start by measuring 13 inches

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.969 
going to start by measuring 13 inches
down<00:01:04.720> from<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.580> chain<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:11.710> going<00:01:11.920> to

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
down from the chain and I'm going to

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.499 
down from the chain and I'm going to
mark<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.580> my<00:01:13.150> desk<00:01:13.590> where<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:15.509> using

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
mark on my desk where that is using

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.170 
mark on my desk where that is using
eyeliner

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and I'm going to attach the little

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.300 
and I'm going to attach the little
four-inch<00:01:34.000> chains<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.380> move<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.860> out<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
four-inch chains so move that out of the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.500 
four-inch chains so move that out of the
way<00:01:39.760> I'm<00:01:40.760> going<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.180> touch<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:44.119> part

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
how we do that is we open up the chain

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:02.350 
how we do that is we open up the chain
attached

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360 

just<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.170> close<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.560> off

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
just to close it off

the fifth link i'm going to attach the
next<00:02:19.860> four<00:02:20.400> inch<00:02:20.670> chain<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:24.890> keep<00:02:25.890> doing<00:02:26.100> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
next four inch chain and keep doing that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.530 
next four inch chain and keep doing that
until<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.910> finish<00:02:27.240> all<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.050> 4<00:02:28.290> inch<00:02:28.410> chain

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
until you finish all the 4 inch chain

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.590 
until you finish all the 4 inch chain
now<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.750> we're<00:02:30.930> done<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.700> front<00:02:33.090> part<00:02:33.240> of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
now that we're done the front part of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.870 
now that we're done the front part of
the<00:02:33.720> chain<00:02:34.170> we're<00:02:34.890> going<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.340> move<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
the chain we're going to move to the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.650 
the chain we're going to move to the
back<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.700> part<00:02:38.970> where<00:02:39.270> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
back and this is the part where you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.650 
back and this is the part where you
should<00:02:40.650> probably<00:02:40.950> try<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:41.760> see<00:02:42.330> how<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
should probably try it on see how it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.890 
should probably try it on see how it
works<00:02:42.900> see<00:02:43.710> if<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.040> properly<00:02:44.910> fits<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.600> lies

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
works see if it properly fits and lies

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.530 
works see if it properly fits and lies
where<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.440> would<00:02:46.860> want<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.580> from<00:02:48.300> here

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
where you would want it to and from here

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.570 
where you would want it to and from here
you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.780> stop<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.800> could<00:02:50.010> keep<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
you can stop and you could keep it that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.820 
you can stop and you could keep it that
way<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:50.940> or<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.570> can<00:02:51.780> continue<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.710> it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
way it is or you can continue and do it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.730 
way it is or you can continue and do it
the<00:02:52.980> way<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.050> we're<00:02:55.050> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.350> tape<00:02:55.710> it

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
the way I do and we're going to tape it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.220 
the way I do and we're going to tape it
up<00:02:55.920> again<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:57.330> time<00:02:57.390> we're<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
up again and this time we're going to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.630 
up again and this time we're going to
bring<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:59.750> back<00:03:00.750> chain<00:03:01.250> make<00:03:02.250> sure<00:03:02.280> it's

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
bring this back chain make sure it's

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
bring this back chain make sure it's
underneath<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.800> as<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.490> see<00:03:05.730> underneath

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
underneath so as you can see underneath

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.030

we're going to move the change only the
front<00:03:11.430> part<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> top<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.890> our<00:03:14.190> work

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
front part up to the top of our work

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.370 
front part up to the top of our work
area

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.220 

and<00:03:19.380> tape<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.770> down<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.840> from<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.020> I'm<00:03:22.140> going

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
and tape it down and from here I'm going

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.380 
and tape it down and from here I'm going
to<00:03:22.590> measure<00:03:22.740> 16<00:03:23.730> inches<00:03:25.880> with<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.000> eyeliner

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
to measure 16 inches with the eyeliner

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.320 
to measure 16 inches with the eyeliner
again<00:03:27.960> so<00:03:28.770> from<00:03:29.100> here<00:03:29.370> we're<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:30.120> take

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
again so from here we're going to take

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:40.120 
again so from here we're going to take
our<00:03:30.540> along<00:03:34.100> 28<00:03:35.100> inch<00:03:35.480> chain<00:03:37.430> place<00:03:38.430> this

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
our along 28 inch chain place this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.410 
our along 28 inch chain place this
underneath<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:43.100> I'm<00:03:44.100> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.430> attach<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
sides each side to the 16 inch mark so

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.880 
sides each side to the 16 inch mark so
now<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.360> we're<00:03:54.690> done<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.990> step<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.530> going

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
now that we're done that step I'm going

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.370 
now that we're done that step I'm going
to<00:03:56.010> take<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.690> long<00:03:57.960> 28<00:03:58.740> inch<00:03:59.040> chain<00:04:00.230> pull<00:04:01.230> it

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
to take the long 28 inch chain pull it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.790 
to take the long 28 inch chain pull it
up<00:04:02.240> and<00:04:03.240> I'm<00:04:03.390> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.720> find<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.530> midpoint

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
up and I'm going to find the midpoint

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.230 
up and I'm going to find the midpoint
and<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:07.110> midpoint<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.740> right<00:04:07.920> here<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.760> what

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
and the midpoint is right here and what

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.350 
and the midpoint is right here and what
I'm<00:04:09.270> going<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.690> do<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.520> I'm<00:04:11.520> going<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.940> take<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
back chain and I'm going to attach the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.979 
back chain and I'm going to attach the
end<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.650> midpoint<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.989> long

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
end of it to the midpoint of this long

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.900 
end of it to the midpoint of this long
28<00:04:22.590> inch<00:04:22.830> chain<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.800> now<00:04:25.980> we're<00:04:26.220> going<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.520> work

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
28 inch chain so now we're going to work

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.430 
28 inch chain so now we're going to work
from<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:28.140> bottom<00:04:28.470> up<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.780> I'm<00:04:30.780> going<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.200> take
