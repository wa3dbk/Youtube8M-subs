00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
whammy bar that sounds awesome sounds

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.840 
whammy bar that sounds awesome sounds
great<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:24.650> harmonics<00:02:25.220> especially<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
great with harmonics especially on the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.940 
great with harmonics especially on the
g-string<00:02:26.470> down<00:02:27.470> or<00:02:27.650> up<00:02:29.530> well<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.800> good

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
g-string down or up well this is a good

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.410 
g-string down or up well this is a good
combo<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.400> 7th<00:02:31.730> fret<00:02:31.850> B<00:02:32.120> fifth<00:02:32.480> fret<00:02:32.660> G

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.940 

we<00:02:36.900> also<00:02:37.080> use<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.530> pinched<00:02:37.770> harmonics

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
we also use it with pinched harmonics

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.470 
we also use it with pinched harmonics
I'm<00:02:38.430> going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> pinch<00:02:38.880> harmonic<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
I'm going to do a pinch harmonic on the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.750 
I'm going to do a pinch harmonic on the
second<00:02:39.840> fret<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.800> g<00:02:41.010> string<00:02:41.310> right<00:02:41.460> around

the neck pickup Eddie Van Halen trick

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.940 
the neck pickup Eddie Van Halen trick
you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.710> do<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> pin<00:02:47.730> drop

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
you can do a pin drop

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.550 
you can do a pin drop
back<00:02:50.520> up<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.270> then<00:02:51.630> hit<00:02:51.780> another<00:02:51.960> harmonic<00:02:52.440> on

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
back up and then hit another harmonic on

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.750 
back up and then hit another harmonic on
the<00:02:52.620> way<00:02:52.740> up

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.730 

really<00:03:02.760> cool<00:03:02.940> stuff<00:03:03.150> also<00:03:03.600> here's<00:03:04.530> another

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
really cool stuff also here's another

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
really cool stuff also here's another
couple<00:03:05.100> things<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.459> do<00:03:05.550> with<00:03:05.670> your

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
couple things you can do with your

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.610 
couple things you can do with your
tremolo<00:03:06.150> bar<00:03:06.330> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.600> bring<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.990> back<00:03:07.140> all<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
tremolo bar if you bring it back all the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.340 
tremolo bar if you bring it back all the
way<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.820> doesn't<00:03:09.150> drop<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:10.170> might

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
way so that it doesn't drop you might

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.050 
way so that it doesn't drop you might
have<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.590> screw<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.640> that

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
have to screw it in like that

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.180 
have to screw it in like that
so<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.810> sits<00:03:12.990> right<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.070> do<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
so that it sits right here you can do a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.890 
so that it sits right here you can do a
little<00:03:14.400> flick<00:03:14.820> on<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.030> back<00:03:15.330> after<00:03:15.630> you

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
little flick on the back after you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.300 
little flick on the back after you
strike<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> note<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.770> got<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> cool<00:03:17.190> effect

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
strike a note and it's got a cool effect

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:26.970 
strike a note and it's got a cool effect
too

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.120 

also<00:03:27.910> grab<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.300> in<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.420> same<00:03:28.630> position<00:03:29.130> to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
also grab it in the same position to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.830 
also grab it in the same position to
raise<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.550> picture<00:03:30.880> note<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:34.239> have<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.390> Fender

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
raise the picture note you have a Fender

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.979 
raise the picture note you have a Fender
Strat<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:35.319> probably<00:03:35.739> won't<00:03:35.890> work<00:03:36.989> because

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
Strat this probably won't work because

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.699 
Strat this probably won't work because
it's<00:03:38.319> got<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> flat<00:03:39.160> tail<00:03:39.520> piece<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:41.290> rests<00:03:41.590> up

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
it's got a flat tail piece that rests up

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.320 
it's got a flat tail piece that rests up
against<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.130> wood<00:03:42.250> tremolo<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.819> great<00:03:43.090> for

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
against the wood tremolo is great for

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.370 
against the wood tremolo is great for
nice<00:03:43.450> clean<00:03:43.780> sounds<00:03:44.260> little<00:03:44.500> jazzy<00:03:44.800> effect

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
nice clean sounds little jazzy effect

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.600 
nice clean sounds little jazzy effect
just<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.500> light<00:03:47.770> movement<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:48.610> bar

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
just a light movement of the bar

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:06.180 
just a light movement of the bar
if<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.760> nice<00:03:51.940> vibrato

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.229 

with<00:04:07.190> everything<00:04:07.519> else<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.819> just<00:04:07.970> takes<00:04:08.150> a

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
with everything else it just takes a

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.850 
with everything else it just takes a
little<00:04:08.330> practice<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:09.080> get<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.319> feel<00:04:09.560> down

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
little practice to get the feel down
