00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
video about stretching years a more

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.130 
video about stretching years a more
natural<00:00:18.000> way<00:00:18.029> instead<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.109> tapers<00:00:19.939> taping

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
natural way instead of tapers taping

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.570 
natural way instead of tapers taping
silicon<00:00:22.140> stuff<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> little

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
silicon stuff like that this is a little

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.550 
silicon stuff like that this is a little
more<00:00:23.730> natural<00:00:24.119> way<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> do<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> um<00:00:24.900> you've

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
more natural way to do it um you've

more natural way to do it um you've
obviously<00:00:25.680> seen<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> video<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.689> husband

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
doing the taper well I did it for him if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
doing the taper well I did it for him if
he<00:00:29.970> wanted<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.840> even<00:00:31.140> though<00:00:31.260> kind

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
he wanted me to do it even though kind

um and his ear totally were thing like

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.600 
um and his ear totally were thing like
we<00:00:36.660> thought<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> obviously<00:00:38.489> you

we thought it would so obviously you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.369 
we thought it would so obviously you
know<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> happen<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:40.170> hair<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
know was it to happen now my hair is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.639 
know was it to happen now my hair is
used<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> 16<00:00:41.579> million<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.480> switch<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> 5/8

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
used to be 16 million or switch is 5/8

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
used to be 16 million or switch is 5/8
of<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.040> inch<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.600> shrunk<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.110> down

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
of an inch and then I shrunk them down

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.459 
of an inch and then I shrunk them down
just<00:00:46.680> by<00:00:47.300> not<00:00:48.300> wearing<00:00:48.510> jewelry<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.050> doing

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
just by not wearing jewelry and doing

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
just by not wearing jewelry and doing
different<00:00:49.710> steps<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> um<00:00:51.059> there's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> video

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
different steps and um there's a video

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.029 
different steps and um there's a video
with<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.199> interested<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.890> can

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
with that if you're interested you can

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.389 
with that if you're interested you can
look<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.370> profile<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:55.370> but<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
look on my profile to see that but I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.979 
look on my profile to see that but I
recently<00:00:56.760> decided<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.660> wanted<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
recently decided that I wanted to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
recently decided that I wanted to
stretch<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:59.010> back<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:01.460> 12<00:01:02.460> that's<00:01:03.390> as

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
stretch them back out to 12 that's as

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
stretch them back out to 12 that's as
high<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.870> could<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.250> they're<00:01:05.460> at

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
high as I could go on a go so they're at

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.830 
high as I could go on a go so they're at
zero<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.600> I've<00:01:09.689> been

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
zero right now so but what I've been

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
zero right now so but what I've been
doing<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.590> oh<00:01:11.540> isn't<00:01:12.830> what<00:01:13.830> I've<00:01:13.950> been<00:01:14.070> doing

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
doing is oh isn't what I've been doing

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.080 
doing is oh isn't what I've been doing
is<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.900> look<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.909> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
is I got a look at them a lot like so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.730 
is I got a look at them a lot like so
just<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> pulling<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.530> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just kind of pulling at them like this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.109 
just kind of pulling at them like this
like<00:01:20.009> throughout<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> day<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> hugging

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like throughout the day this is hugging

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.780 
like throughout the day this is hugging
a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.830> especially<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.979> they're<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.490> like

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
a lot especially if they're really like

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.120 
a lot especially if they're really like
warm<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.619> lotion<00:01:25.770> or

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
warm or like if I just put lotion or

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.450 
warm or like if I just put lotion or
some

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
some

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
some
because<00:01:27.120> I<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.600> dry<00:01:27.870> ears<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.680> lotion

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because I get dry ears so I put lotion

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
because I get dry ears so I put lotion
on<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> rub<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.510> and<00:01:30.780> I'd<00:01:30.869> also

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
on them and I rub it in so and I'd also

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.760 
on them and I rub it in so and I'd also
take<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.830> out<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.020> like<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.260> of<00:01:34.320> stick<00:01:34.590> my

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
take them out and like kind of stick my

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.920 
take them out and like kind of stick my
fingers<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:36.080> like<00:01:37.080> that<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.820> see

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
fingers in like that and as you can see

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
fingers in like that and as you can see
that's<00:01:39.930> much<00:01:40.140> bigger<00:01:40.440> than<00:01:41.570> eight

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's much bigger than eight

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.230 
that's much bigger than eight
millimeters<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.060> from

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
millimeters and that's just from

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
millimeters and that's just from
massaging<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:45.930> tugging<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.440> obviously<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
massaging and tugging and obviously this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.859 
massaging and tugging and obviously this
is<00:01:47.580> probably<00:01:47.940> easier<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.330> me<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:48.630> my

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is probably easier for me because my

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
is probably easier for me because my
ears<00:01:49.080> have<00:01:49.259> been<00:01:49.380> pre<00:01:49.710> stretched<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.850> they

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
ears have been pre stretched so they

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.859 
ears have been pre stretched so they
probably<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> lot<00:01:51.630> more<00:01:51.680> lovey<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.830> them

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
probably have a lot more lovey in them

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.639 
probably have a lot more lovey in them
so<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.990> these<00:01:58.229> double

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so I do that so I have these double

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.749 
so I do that so I have these double
zeros<00:02:01.940> have<00:02:02.940> these<00:02:03.119> double<00:02:03.450> zeros<00:02:04.550> and<00:02:05.550> I'm

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
zeros have these double zeros and I'm

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
zeros have these double zeros and I'm
pretty<00:02:06.330> much<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.720> put<00:02:06.990> them<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.369> like

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
it's got the double zero in it was just

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.479 
it's got the double zero in it was just
a<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.430> bit<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> push<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.810> get<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.489> not
