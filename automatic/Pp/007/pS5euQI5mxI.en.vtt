here's<00:00:03.389> some<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.810> my<00:00:04.460> electrolyte<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.759> we

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
here's some of my electrolyte that we

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.140 
here's some of my electrolyte that we
put<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.270> our<00:00:06.390> hydrogen<00:00:06.810> generators<00:00:08.059> here's<00:00:09.059> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
put in our hydrogen generators here's a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.049 
put in our hydrogen generators here's a
close-up<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:11.040> installation<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.880> the

close-up of the installation of the
water<00:00:12.300> trap<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:14.420> top<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.960> water<00:00:16.230> trap<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
water trap on top of the water trap is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
water trap on top of the water trap is
the<00:00:16.949> line<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.160> into<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.000> air<00:00:18.300> intake

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the line out into the air intake

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.689 
the line out into the air intake
manifold<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:20.250> tees<00:00:20.640> into<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.270> PCV<00:00:21.930> valve

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
manifold which tees into the PCV valve

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.250 
manifold which tees into the PCV valve
and<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:23.789> there's<00:00:24.029> copper<00:00:24.689> line<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.140> runs

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and then there's copper line that runs

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.849 
and then there's copper line that runs
over<00:00:25.789> to<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.029> hydrogen<00:00:27.720> oxygen<00:00:28.170> generator

and think that it's the wave of the
future<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.860> does<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> hybrid
