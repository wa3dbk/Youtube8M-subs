as guide goes I just want to talk about

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.919 
as guide goes I just want to talk about
how<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.769> work<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> gonna<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.210> super

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
how they work this is gonna be super

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.450 
how they work this is gonna be super
super<00:00:31.140> basic<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> already<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.309> how

super basic so if you already know how

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.950 
super basic so if you already know how
the<00:00:32.520> amplifiers<00:00:32.940> work<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.660> ahead

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the amplifiers work you know going ahead

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.540 
the amplifiers work you know going ahead

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
amplifiers and they they know kind of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.959 
amplifiers and they they know kind of
that<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> system<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.579> runes<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that the system is like runes and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
that the system is like runes and
masteries<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.780> additional<00:00:43.230> stats<00:00:43.500> for

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
on them so let's go ahead and take a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400 
on them so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> page<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> message<00:00:49.230> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
first I want to talk about augments

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.030 
first I want to talk about augments
because<00:01:16.110> some<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.439> League<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> Legends

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
because some of you League of Legends

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
because some of you League of Legends
players<00:01:17.220> who<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.119> coming<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.689> game

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
players who are coming over to this game

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.880 
players who are coming over to this game
are<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.049> many<00:01:19.170> people<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> little

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
are so many people that know a little

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.260 
are so many people that know a little
bit<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.220> league<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> legends<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:20.939> probably

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
bit about league of legends are probably

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
bit about league of legends are probably
going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.720> familiar<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.200> these

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
going to be more familiar with these

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
going to be more familiar with these
these<00:01:22.770> augments<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.460> actually<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.479> stats

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
these augments are actually just stats

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.590 
these augments are actually just stats
they<00:01:25.530> give<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.009> stats<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.909> flat<00:01:27.240> stats

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
they give you stats they have flat stats

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
they give you stats they have flat stats
you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> tells<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> flattened

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you can see it tells you the flattened

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.620 
you can see it tells you the flattened
out<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> gives<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.479> have

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
out that it gives and then they have

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.590 
out that it gives and then they have
scaling<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.310> gives<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.790> plus

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
scaling for this one it gives you plus

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.569 
scaling for this one it gives you plus
point<00:01:34.079> zero<00:01:34.170> five<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.600> 0.53<00:01:36.950> power<00:01:37.950> damage<00:01:38.250> per

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
point zero five or 0.53 power damage per

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
point zero five or 0.53 power damage per
level<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.479> means<00:01:39.689> every<00:01:40.020> single<00:01:40.320> level

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
level that means every single level

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
level that means every single level
you're<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> get<00:01:41.280> point<00:01:41.759> five<00:01:42.000> three

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you're going to get point five three

while the flats I believe stop at levels
8<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.810> 10<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.500> again<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.070> want<00:04:23.099> those

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
quite scale all the way up as if I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.350 
quite scale all the way up as if I
where<00:04:26.699> to<00:04:26.789> get<00:04:26.939> a<00:04:28.129> scaling<00:04:29.129> power<00:04:29.370> pen<00:04:29.729> then

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
where to get a scaling power pen then

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.670 
where to get a scaling power pen then
the<00:04:30.479> power<00:04:30.689> pen<00:04:30.840> would<00:04:30.990> actually<00:04:31.319> go<00:04:31.439> further

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
the power pen would actually go further

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.379 
the power pen would actually go further
throughout<00:04:32.159> the<00:04:32.280> game<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.610> become<00:04:32.849> a<00:04:32.879> greater

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
throughout the game and become a greater

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.390 
throughout the game and become a greater
value<00:04:33.689> than<00:04:33.719> 1.8<00:04:34.229> but<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.889> just<00:04:35.069> on<00:04:35.219> your

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
value than 1.8 but it's just on your

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.369 
value than 1.8 but it's just on your
preference<00:04:35.819> so<00:04:36.120> hopefully<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:37.080> helped<00:04:37.349> a

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
preference so hopefully this helped a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.420 
preference so hopefully this helped a
little<00:04:37.409> bit<00:04:37.680> hopefully<00:04:38.069> you<00:04:38.129> learned<00:04:38.340> a

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
little bit hopefully you learned a

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.770 
little bit hopefully you learned a
little<00:04:38.580> bit<00:04:38.669> about<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:39.060> mods<00:04:39.270> an<00:04:39.449> argument

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
little bit about the mods an argument

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.420 
little bit about the mods an argument
system<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.229> isn't<00:04:40.379> an<00:04:40.650> infinite<00:04:41.099> crisis

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
system that isn't an infinite crisis

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.649 
system that isn't an infinite crisis
again<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.939> just<00:04:42.090> have<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.210> check<00:04:42.419> through

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
again you just have to check through
