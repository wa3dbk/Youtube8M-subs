off the bat you'll notice a little

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.140 
off the bat you'll notice a little
something<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> little<00:00:13.889> interesting<00:00:14.150> but

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
something a little interesting but

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.779 
something a little interesting but
there's<00:00:15.360> no<00:00:15.540> no<00:00:16.440> screen<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.279> when<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> first

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
there's no no screen so when I first

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.060 
there's no no screen so when I first
opened<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.180> Box<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.529> okay<00:00:20.039> maybe

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
opened the Box I was like okay maybe

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.429 
opened the Box I was like okay maybe
this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> dock<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.199> just

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this is just like a dock and you just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.160 
this is just like a dock and you just
kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.189> there's<00:00:23.400> no<00:00:23.609> no<00:00:24.570> hinges

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
kind of like but there's no no hinges

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.170 
kind of like but there's no no hinges
along<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> outside<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.730> first<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
along the outside so at first I was a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.560 
along the outside so at first I was a
little<00:00:27.240> taken<00:00:27.630> aback<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> later<00:00:30.119> find

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
little taken aback but then I later find

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.530 
little taken aback but then I later find
out<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> has<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.619> magnetic<00:00:32.460> cover<00:00:33.149> board

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
out that it has a magnetic cover board

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.860 
out that it has a magnetic cover board
so<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.770> pull<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> apart<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.540> completely

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so you pull it apart and it's completely

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.340 
so you pull it apart and it's completely
magnetic<00:00:37.530> along<00:00:37.850> along<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> sides<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.660> so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
magnetic along along the sides and so

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
magnetic along along the sides and so
they're<00:00:40.530> calling<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.510> cover<00:00:42.510> board<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
they're calling this the cover board and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.270 
they're calling this the cover board and
so<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.070> acts<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:45.149> full<00:00:45.870> keyboard<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.829> little

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so it acts as a full keyboard a little

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
so it acts as a full keyboard a little
dock<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:48.840> acts<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.920> screen

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
dock but it also acts as a screen

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.529 
dock but it also acts as a screen
protector<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:51.930> cool<00:00:53.300> once<00:00:54.300> it's

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
protector which is pretty cool once it's

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.209 
protector which is pretty cool once it's
on<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.440> tight<00:00:55.739> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
on there it's on there pretty tight it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490 
on there it's on there pretty tight it's
not<00:00:56.280> coming<00:00:56.789> off<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.510> before<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> knew<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.410> was

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
not coming off like before I knew it was

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
not coming off like before I knew it was
a<00:00:58.530> magnetic<00:00:59.100> cover<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.640> was<00:01:00.300> having<00:01:00.570> troubles

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a magnetic cover I was having troubles

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.369 
a magnetic cover I was having troubles
getting<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.000> there<00:01:03.000> PR<00:01:03.449> told<00:01:04.140> me<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
getting there and there PR told me that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.179 
getting there and there PR told me that
if<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.080> do<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> twist<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.040> could

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
if you kind of do a do a twist you could

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
if you kind of do a do a twist you could
do<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> twist<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
do it but I think the twist is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
do it but I think the twist is
impractical<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
impractical and you can just kind of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
impractical and you can just kind of
wedge<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.500> fingernail<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.580> there

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
wedge your little fingernail in there

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.530 
wedge your little fingernail in there
and<00:01:14.880> pull<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> apart<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.780> works<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:17.540> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and pull it apart that works for me this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.520 
and pull it apart that works for me this
thing<00:01:19.729> like<00:01:20.729> saying<00:01:21.390> thin<00:01:21.960> doesn't<00:01:22.380> really

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
thing like saying thin doesn't really

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
thing like saying thin doesn't really
describe<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.310> mean<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.840> ultra<00:01:24.840> thin<00:01:26.390> almost

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
describe I mean it is ultra thin almost

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
describe I mean it is ultra thin almost
to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> point<00:01:28.200> where<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.479> yeah<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.930> Adam

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to the point where it's yeah it's Adam

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
to the point where it's yeah it's Adam
it's<00:01:32.130> dangerous<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> bend<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.189> when<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's dangerous to bend it when it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.490 
it's dangerous to bend it when it's
connected<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.090> actual<00:01:36.720> tablet<00:01:36.960> part<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
connected to the actual tablet part it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
connected to the actual tablet part it's
not<00:01:37.650> too<00:01:37.829> bad<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.340> having<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.509> by<00:01:39.960> itself

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
not too bad but having it just by itself

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.520 
not too bad but having it just by itself
is<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> scary<00:01:41.310> I'll<00:01:41.670> show<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.530> how'd

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is kind of scary I'll show you if how'd

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.179 
is kind of scary I'll show you if how'd
it<00:01:43.560> dock<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.750> first<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.380> take<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.860> corner

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it dock it first you take this corner

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.710 
it dock it first you take this corner
piece<00:01:47.430> right<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
piece right here and you just kind of

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840 
piece right here and you just kind of
slide<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.040> magnetic<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
slide it up and it's magnetic so it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.639 
slide it up and it's magnetic so it
actually<00:01:51.000> doesn't<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> crop<00:01:51.930> itself<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
actually doesn't kind of crop itself it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.999 
actually doesn't kind of crop itself it
needs<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.220> tablet<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:54.479> sturdy<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.229> stick

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
needs the tablet to be sturdy just stick

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:56.450 
needs the tablet to be sturdy just stick
it<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.219> there

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
it in there

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.039 
it in there
and<00:01:56.640> boom<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.380> are<00:01:58.409> connected<00:01:59.310> and<00:02:00.049> the

and boom you are connected and the
profile<00:02:01.530> isn't<00:02:01.920> too<00:02:02.250> bad

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
profile isn't too bad

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.910 
profile isn't too bad
try<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.600> get<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.840> up<00:02:04.990> here<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.230> you<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.470> see<00:02:05.710> I

we<00:04:26.740> can<00:04:26.890> take<00:04:27.070> some<00:04:27.100> close-ups<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.300> screen

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
we can take some close-ups of the screen

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.540 
we can take some close-ups of the screen
and<00:04:28.720> kind<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.870> show<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.160> just<00:04:30.160> kind<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.400> like

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
looking down here whenever I look at it

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.830 
looking down here whenever I look at it
with<00:04:32.890> my<00:04:33.040> bare<00:04:33.310> eye<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:34.120> can<00:04:34.270> really<00:04:34.540> see<00:04:34.810> just

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
with my bare eye you can really see just

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.980 
with my bare eye you can really see just
like<00:04:35.260> each<00:04:35.560> little<00:04:36.160> individual<00:04:36.730> pixel<00:04:37.270> which

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
like each little individual pixel which

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.890 
like each little individual pixel which
can<00:04:38.380> be<00:04:38.470> frustrating<00:04:38.980> for<00:04:39.010> some<00:04:39.370> but<00:04:39.900> it's

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
can be frustrating for some but it's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.810 
can be frustrating for some but it's
just<00:04:41.260> like<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.740> cheaper<00:04:42.220> tablet<00:04:42.580> you're<00:04:42.700> just

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
just like a cheaper tablet you're just

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.280 
just like a cheaper tablet you're just
gonna<00:04:42.940> be<00:04:43.030> playing<00:04:43.300> games<00:04:43.570> browsing<00:04:44.200> the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
gonna be playing games browsing the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.840 
gonna be playing games browsing the
Internet<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.040> with<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.310> doc<00:04:45.550> you're<00:04:45.760> gonna

don't<00:04:49.090> think<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:50.350> screen<00:04:50.710> resolution<00:04:51.250> is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
don't think like screen resolution is

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.690 
don't think like screen resolution is
going<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:51.910> really<00:04:52.060> affect<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.540> all<00:04:52.690> too<00:04:52.900> much

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
a docking station which you just set it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.730 
a docking station which you just set it
on<00:05:19.600> then<00:05:19.780> then<00:05:19.930> it's<00:05:20.050> also<00:05:20.170> going<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.500> come

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
on then then it's also going to come

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.500 
on then then it's also going to come
with<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.980> speaker<00:05:21.400> dock<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:22.060> set<00:05:22.270> it<00:05:22.300> on

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
with a speaker dock and you set it on

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.000 
with a speaker dock and you set it on
there<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:22.930> then<00:05:23.050> it's<00:05:23.200> going<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.470> be<00:05:23.770> able<00:05:23.950> to

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
there and then it's going to be able to

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.770 
there and then it's going to be able to
take<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.490> audio<00:05:24.850> that's<00:05:25.120> been<00:05:25.300> coming<00:05:25.660> out<00:05:25.720> of

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
take the audio that's been coming out of

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.880 
take the audio that's been coming out of
this<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.020> put<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:26.410> through<00:05:26.530> some<00:05:26.710> nice

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
this and put it through some nice

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.950 
this and put it through some nice
speakers<00:05:27.370> so<00:05:28.150> if<00:05:28.270> that's<00:05:28.450> more<00:05:28.660> your<00:05:28.750> style

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
speakers so if that's more your style

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.900 
speakers so if that's more your style
then<00:05:29.230> there<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.410> go<00:05:31.440> basically<00:05:32.440> it's<00:05:32.910> pretty

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
then there you go basically it's pretty

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.940 
then there you go basically it's pretty
thin<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:36.690> it's<00:05:37.690> pretty<00:05:38.020> vanilla<00:05:38.170> I<00:05:38.650> mean

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
thin and it's pretty vanilla I mean

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.530 
thin and it's pretty vanilla I mean
there's<00:05:39.100> not<00:05:39.280> much<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.550> say<00:05:39.700> it's<00:05:39.910> just<00:05:40.060> it's

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
there's not much to say it's just it's

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.010 
there's not much to say it's just it's
another<00:05:40.750> tablet<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:43.120> far<00:05:43.390> from<00:05:43.630> having<00:05:43.930> it

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
another tablet so far from having it

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.130 
another tablet so far from having it
I've<00:05:44.080> had<00:05:44.200> it<00:05:44.260> for<00:05:44.500> about<00:05:44.590> a<00:05:44.680> week<00:05:44.770> now<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:46.330> I

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
I've had it for about a week now and I

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.320 
I've had it for about a week now and I
kind<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.560> like<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:48.220> could<00:05:48.400> probably<00:05:49.090> do

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
kind of like it I could probably do

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.180 
kind of like it I could probably do
without<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.900> cover<00:05:50.110> board<00:05:50.440> keyboard<00:05:50.950> dock

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
without the cover board keyboard dock

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.250 
without the cover board keyboard dock
because<00:05:51.610> I<00:05:51.760> myself<00:05:52.270> really<00:05:52.810> don't<00:05:52.990> have<00:05:53.110> too

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
because I myself really don't have too

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.690 
because I myself really don't have too
much<00:05:53.380> use<00:05:53.650> for<00:05:53.860> that<00:05:53.950> type<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.310> stuff<00:05:54.520> and

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
much use for that type of stuff and

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.150 
much use for that type of stuff and
honestly<00:05:55.510> I<00:05:55.630> think<00:05:55.720> it's<00:05:55.990> just<00:05:56.200> really<00:05:56.560> flimsy

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
honestly I think it's just really flimsy

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.540 
honestly I think it's just really flimsy
I<00:05:58.140> probably<00:05:59.140> would<00:05:59.410> not<00:05:59.560> travel<00:05:59.980> with<00:06:00.100> this<00:06:00.310> I

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
I probably would not travel with this I

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.810 
I probably would not travel with this I
don't<00:06:01.330> think<00:06:01.540> it<00:06:01.660> could<00:06:01.810> probably<00:06:01.960> handle

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
don't think it could probably handle

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.130 
don't think it could probably handle
handle<00:06:03.820> the<00:06:03.910> type<00:06:04.060> of<00:06:04.120> stress<00:06:04.450> I<00:06:04.630> would<00:06:04.780> put<00:06:04.990> on

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
handle the type of stress I would put on
