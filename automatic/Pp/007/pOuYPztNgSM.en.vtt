am making a game wait what so one of the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
am making a game wait what so one of the
questions<00:00:06.450> i<00:00:06.930> got<00:00:07.140> asked<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.680> petty<00:00:08.010> stay

questions i got asked was petty stay

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.190 
questions i got asked was petty stay
motivated<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:09.090> actually<00:00:09.330> finish<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.960> project

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
motivated to actually finish a project

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.680 
motivated to actually finish a project
and<00:00:10.590> not<00:00:10.830> just<00:00:11.070> run<00:00:11.460> off<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.940> whatever<00:00:12.210> idea

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and not just run off with whatever idea

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.020 
and not just run off with whatever idea

catches your eye part of the way I deal

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.810 
catches your eye part of the way I deal
with<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> actually<00:00:16.560> run<00:00:17.400> off<00:00:17.580> with

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
with that is to actually run off with

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880 
with that is to actually run off with
that<00:00:17.970> idea<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:19.020> pursue<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:19.770> least

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that idea and just pursue it at least

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
that idea and just pursue it at least
for<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.220> little<00:00:20.400> bit<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.300> an<00:00:21.449> idea<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.779> called

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
for a little bit it's an idea I called

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.490 
for a little bit it's an idea I called
code<00:00:22.560> sketching<00:00:23.960> which<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.320> like

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
code sketching which is a lot like

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.950 
code sketching which is a lot like
prototyping<00:00:26.010> when<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> prototype<00:00:27.480> something

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
prototyping when you prototype something

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
prototyping when you prototype something
you're<00:00:28.470> really<00:00:28.500> looking<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.310> try<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.760> one

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you're really looking to try out one

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
you're really looking to try out one
very<00:00:30.570> specific<00:00:30.960> idea<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.219> it

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
very specific idea to see how it

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.370 
very specific idea to see how it
actually<00:00:32.460> plays<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.780> specific

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
actually plays or one specific

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.200 
actually plays or one specific
implementation<00:00:35.160> approach<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.090> it'll

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
implementation approach to see if it'll

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.139 
implementation approach to see if it'll
actually<00:00:36.480> work<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.350> scale<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.129> forth<00:00:38.430> with

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
actually work and scale so forth with

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.330 
actually work and scale so forth with
code<00:00:39.360> sketching<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.020> kind<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> feel<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
code sketching I kind of feel like I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
code sketching I kind of feel like I
just<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:42.239> idea<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.960> mind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.730> something

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
just have an idea in mind of something

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.840 
just have an idea in mind of something
I'd<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.300> either<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:45.870> recreate<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I'd like to either do or recreate and I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
I'd like to either do or recreate and I
just<00:00:48.090> sort<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> start<00:00:48.989> working<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just sort of start working on it and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
just sort of start working on it and
figure<00:00:50.579> things<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.559> anyway<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
figure things out from there anyway I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
figure things out from there anyway I
think<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> waste<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.969> time<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
think that's kind of waste of time and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.229 
think that's kind of waste of time and
to<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> certain<00:00:55.199> extent<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.460> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to a certain extent if it's kind of a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
to a certain extent if it's kind of a
waste<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.570> time<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.500> some<00:00:58.680> big

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
waste of time but there's some big

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650 
waste of time but there's some big
benefits<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.640> first<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.420> i'm

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
benefits to it first of all i'm

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
benefits to it first of all i'm
typically<00:01:01.020> sketching<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.590> something<00:01:02.129> pretty

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
typically sketching out something pretty

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
typically sketching out something pretty
much<00:01:03.000> new<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.660> me<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> be

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
much new to me so I'm going to be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.560 
much new to me so I'm going to be
learning<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:05.189> often<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.270> sketches

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
learning something often these sketches

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
learning something often these sketches
are<00:01:06.930> things<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.229> I've<00:01:07.439> seen<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.890> other<00:01:08.040> games

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
are things that I've seen in other games

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820 
are things that I've seen in other games
like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> neat<00:01:09.060> mechanic<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> cool<00:01:10.170> engine<00:01:10.470> or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
like a neat mechanic or a cool engine or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
like a neat mechanic or a cool engine or
something<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.240> really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
something like that so I'm really

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
something like that so I'm really
figuring<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:13.049> how<00:01:13.229> something<00:01:13.470> works<00:01:13.890> by

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
figuring out how something works by

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
figuring out how something works by
trying<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> recreate<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> myself<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.990> also

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
trying to recreate it myself I also

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
trying to recreate it myself I also
think<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.830> important<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> satisfy<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
think it's important to satisfy that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
think it's important to satisfy that
curiosity<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.890> really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
curiosity you have if I'm really

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
curiosity you have if I'm really
interested<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.820> making<00:01:21.150> something<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.049> say

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
interested in making something and I say

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.050 
interested in making something and I say
no<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.590> can't<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.850> do

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
no you can't make it I have to go do

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.570 
no you can't make it I have to go do
this<00:01:24.450> other<00:01:24.689> work<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.250> doing<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this other work then what I'm doing the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.800 
this other work then what I'm doing the
other<00:01:26.670> work<00:01:26.880> I'm<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.299> gonna<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.570> thinking

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
other work I'm just gonna be thinking

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
other work I'm just gonna be thinking
about<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.350> thing<00:01:28.409> anyway<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.759> sometimes<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
about this thing anyway so sometimes you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 
about this thing anyway so sometimes you
have<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> break<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.350> satisfy<00:01:31.770> your

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
have to break down and just satisfy your

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.819 
have to break down and just satisfy your
curiosity<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.060> lastly<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.799> being

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
curiosity and lastly what good is being

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.280 
curiosity and lastly what good is being
in<00:01:35.220> D<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> can't<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.329> say<00:01:36.570> forget<00:01:37.020> all

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
in D if you can't just say forget all

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
in D if you can't just say forget all
that<00:01:37.320> stuff<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.979> want<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.490> work<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that stuff I want to go work on this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
that stuff I want to go work on this

right now so let me show you what I've

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.770 
right now so let me show you what I've
been<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> past<00:01:41.549> day<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:41.970> like

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
been up to in the past day or so like

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.630 
been up to in the past day or so like
most<00:01:43.110> indie<00:01:43.470> developers<00:01:43.979> I've<00:01:44.460> been

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
most indie developers I've been

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670 
most indie developers I've been
intrigued<00:01:45.060> by<00:01:45.060> Minecraft<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> engineer

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
intrigued by Minecraft and the engineer

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.469 
intrigued by Minecraft and the engineer
in<00:01:46.770> me<00:01:46.799> wants<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> figure<00:01:47.579> out<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.210> works

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in me wants to figure out how it works

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.319 
in me wants to figure out how it works
so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> started<00:01:49.470> off<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.770> some<00:01:50.009> naive

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
so I started off with some naive

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.190 
so I started off with some naive
implementations<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> figured<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.170> just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
implementations and figured I would just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.039 
implementations and figured I would just
iterate<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.490> started<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.390> drying<00:01:54.840> an

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
iterate on them I started with drying an

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.350 
iterate on them I started with drying an
arbitrary<00:01:55.649> cube<00:01:56.040> which<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.850> kind<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
arbitrary cube which was kind of a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.670 
arbitrary cube which was kind of a
challenge<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:57.869> someone<00:01:58.140> who<00:01:58.200> hasn't<00:01:58.439> done

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
challenge for someone who hasn't done

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.069 
challenge for someone who hasn't done
much<00:01:58.890> 3d<00:01:59.310> work<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.210> led<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.450> some

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
much 3d work that led into some

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
much 3d work that led into some
investigation<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.189> cameras<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.030> see

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
investigation into cameras you can see

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.510 
investigation into cameras you can see
the<00:02:03.360> first<00:02:03.899> person<00:02:04.259> camera<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.490> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the first person camera here and then I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.029 
the first person camera here and then I
switched<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> third<00:02:07.350> person<00:02:07.649> chase

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
switched up to a third person chase

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.589 
switched up to a third person chase
camera<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.729> figured<00:02:09.060> out<00:02:09.149> how<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> switch

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
camera and figured out how to switch

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.140 
camera and figured out how to switch
between<00:02:09.750> them<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.039> added<00:02:11.220> lots<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.819> cubes

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
between them then I added lots of cubes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
between them then I added lots of cubes
after<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.200> added<00:02:13.440> an

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
after that I added an

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
after that I added an
if<00:02:13.950> collision<00:02:14.460> implementation<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:16.020> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
if collision implementation and then it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.170 
if collision implementation and then it
became<00:02:16.350> obvious<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.770> having<00:02:17.610> really<00:02:17.970> heavy

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
became obvious that having really heavy

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.510 
became obvious that having really heavy
weight<00:02:18.420> cubes<00:02:18.870> where<00:02:19.290> they<00:02:19.500> stored<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.160> sorts

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
weight cubes where they stored all sorts

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.100 
weight cubes where they stored all sorts
of<00:02:20.610> bounding<00:02:21.060> information<00:02:21.600> inside<00:02:21.870> them

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
of bounding information inside them

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
of bounding information inside them
wasn't<00:02:22.830> really<00:02:22.920> practical<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> switch<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
wasn't really practical so I switch to a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
wasn't really practical so I switch to a
more<00:02:24.570> grid<00:02:25.020> based<00:02:25.230> approach<00:02:25.740> which<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.190> believe

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
more grid based approach which I believe

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
more grid based approach which I believe
is<00:02:26.490> how<00:02:26.730> minecraft<00:02:27.240> actually<00:02:27.720> does<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.050> after

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
is how minecraft actually does it after

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.310 
is how minecraft actually does it after
that<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.860> started<00:02:29.340> adding<00:02:29.670> picking<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:30.900> I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
that I started adding picking because I

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.680 
that I started adding picking because I
felt<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.550> can't<00:02:32.790> add<00:02:32.970> or<00:02:33.150> remove<00:02:33.270> box

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
felt like it you can't add or remove box

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.930 
felt like it you can't add or remove box
yet<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.290> now<00:02:34.500> successfully<00:02:35.250> look<00:02:35.640> at

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
yet but you can now successfully look at

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.180 
yet but you can now successfully look at
the<00:02:36.300> block<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.810> highlight<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> next<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.040> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the block and highlight it next up a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
the block and highlight it next up a
look<00:02:38.400> at<00:02:38.550> adding<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:38.970> removing<00:02:39.060> blocks

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
look at adding and removing blocks

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.970 
look at adding and removing blocks
because<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:40.440> seems<00:02:40.680> most

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
because that's what seems most

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.950 
because that's what seems most
interesting<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.580> me<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.450> also<00:02:42.600> become

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
interesting to me it's also become

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.030 
interesting to me it's also become
obvious<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.500> i'm<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.770> need<00:02:43.860> some

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
obvious that i'm going to need some

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.830 
obvious that i'm going to need some
better<00:02:44.160> debug<00:02:44.670> drawing<00:02:44.970> support<00:02:45.330> which<00:02:45.690> is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
better debug drawing support which is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.880 
better debug drawing support which is
something<00:02:46.020> i<00:02:46.200> wouldn't<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.530> found<00:02:46.650> out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
something i wouldn't have found out

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.110 
something i wouldn't have found out
until<00:02:47.220> i<00:02:47.250> actually<00:02:47.430> went<00:02:47.790> through<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
until i actually went through the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.300 
until i actually went through the
motions<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.660> doing<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.080> one<00:02:49.770> thing<00:02:49.800> i'm<00:02:50.070> not

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
motions of doing this one thing i'm not

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
motions of doing this one thing i'm not
looking<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:50.820> adding<00:02:50.970> right<00:02:51.240> now<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.990> better

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
looking at adding right now is a better

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.199 
looking at adding right now is a better
collision<00:02:52.740> detection<00:02:53.040> method<00:02:53.550> right<00:02:54.060> now

collision detection method right now

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.970 
collision detection method right now
it's<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:54.720> kind<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.110> brute<00:02:55.380> force<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
it's really kind of brute force and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.920 
it's really kind of brute force and
naive<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.240> i<00:02:57.360> don't<00:02:57.540> need<00:02:57.720> anything

quickly don't implement anything until
you<00:03:06.270> really<00:03:06.690> need<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.500> sort<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.100> a
