00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
there's everything but classics as well

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.979 
there's everything but classics as well
people<00:02:20.890> make<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.340> sort<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.480> idea<00:02:22.660> of

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
people make the sort of this idea of

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.390 
people make the sort of this idea of
this<00:02:23.050> impression<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.620> Japan<00:02:24.069> might<00:02:24.280> be

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
this impression that Japan might be

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.580 
this impression that Japan might be
cheaper

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.250 

it's<00:02:28.099> actually<00:02:28.489> if<00:02:29.239> not<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.599> same<00:02:29.810> price<00:02:30.080> is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
it's actually if not the same price is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.619 
it's actually if not the same price is
probably<00:02:30.620> more<00:02:30.830> expensive<00:02:31.190> than<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> rest<00:02:32.510> of

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
probably more expensive than the rest of

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.780 
probably more expensive than the rest of
the<00:02:32.720> world<00:02:32.930> but<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.290> quality<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:34.550> much

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the world but the quality is that much

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.750 
the world but the quality is that much
wider<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:36.200> items<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.980> get<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.489> much

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
wider the items that you get that much

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.100 
wider the items that you get that much
better<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.340> sort<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.370> changes<00:02:40.849> then<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.810> I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
better that it sort of changes then so I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.869 
better that it sort of changes then so I
get<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> lot<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.129> mouths<00:02:43.310> from<00:02:43.519> people<00:02:43.730> saying

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879
