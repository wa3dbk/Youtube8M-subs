 I will cut my hair to do the same 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.620
 with all your hair 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.679
 on the coast 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.400
 to part they come 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 wrong choice anyway something would be global 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.000
 so to realize 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.540
 e your coach that I think I would have been so often illicit 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.090
 hairdresser 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.900
 after 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.500
 an elastic 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.110
 and grace 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.190
 so to start with our trouble you come 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.380
 vote montebourg 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 I am a blogger 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.210
 here 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 so once needed 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 you hold hair well so that your ideas are these shots 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 feet by the south trace 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 Quebec Oct. 6 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.020
 yes she is very beautiful 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 like that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 but his closest to maximum pc games 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.210
 rebel 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.030
 the aggressor who was always cut off 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 what do you want the decline 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 if you miss for any reason 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.559
 it will always be more sold 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.559
 so it will be mixed 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 and you can always catch up with your side 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.969
 mascherano and my hair like that 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.969
 and I do not want to cut a bit short but do not break a lot 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.749
 so you imagine yourself 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.219
 I was really so what are your dreams perez I cut 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.279
 Why 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.129
 simply because he is 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.129
 i will come back like this with the united states 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.149
 walnut is the same length 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.009
 and I started again 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
 so I bring them back one more time 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.940
 and it is successful 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.940
 I will not cut myself off from Paris 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.479
 but it's deserved 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.329
 listened a little more 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.939
 that's all I hate 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 you have any other party 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.339
 eric you're going to say that to something on this side so see the difference 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.199
 4 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.569
 I did not succeed 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.649
 your kitty good enough 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.649
 because 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.399
 and you will see the difference to come true 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.399
 it's not a soaked surprise 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.769
 you had 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.219
 a species of comparison the left 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.039
 Yes 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.959
 a party that she 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.009
 titoff rc come cut 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.079
 while informing that on the other side 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.939
 as I said previously 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.939
 yes I could have 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.409
 I will die 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.909
 a justice sponsorship he was always ready to die as a couple 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.059
 - what do you think 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.059
 - yes still answers that I count 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
 for once 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.270
 it does not stop 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.189
 so 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.229
 aqmi do not chome this center she in england 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.099
 if ever in these areas 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.099
 the ump is not enough price 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.189
 in the polls m 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.089
 and simply we will ask someone 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.620
 who comes to check because she goes the central pair and retouching 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.620
 required tgv below the alert threshold 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.099
 so that's what I'm going to do 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.099
 when he has things to say 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.949
 we want to start 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.990
 alas she specifies 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.449
 you have sounds 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.449
 we understand so it's pretty complicated 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:56.719
 like this 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.719
 eh be 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.199
 are not coupled in fact 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.869
 novethic of assises like that and you are you if we follow you 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.189
 occurrence of capital 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.649
 so in fact know that the army was then only on the board lens 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:27.059
 you have to do it several times 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.219
 There you go 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.300
 but things are cut off 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.490
 other countries are also the most hated 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.569
 will assume 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.680
 yes that makes the current crisis 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.940
 I want to take care of synthesis which represents more than two-thirds for this 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.439
 been because otherwise 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.139
 she was there and you support I hope she will pay you 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.990
 do not forget that when you try if your hair and are always earlier 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.050
 that what you listen to it will go through a neighbor 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.020
 so that's just not really frankly whatever the summer time and that 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.110
 did you have you if I had forgotten not to say anyway what to do 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.759
 magatte thiam
