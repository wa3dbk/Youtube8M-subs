00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.560
 very good today we are going to teach them to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.000
 make a small impromptu vase with 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.860
 a can of soda the first thing that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.520
 we have to do will be to take this 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.520
 ring 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 and now we're going to cut more or less by 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.529
 here 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.560
 at this point we can do it with a 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.009
 saw with a pair of scissors a cutter or 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.650
 even a can opener we cut through here 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.770
 then we do 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 the cut 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.180
 in this case I 'm going to do it with some 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.300
 scissors we are going to do so we squeeze 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 very carefully always 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 to give us 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.140
 and more 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.140
 and from there 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.070
 cutting up 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.690
 I recommend this to the old post 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.690
 that new ones can damage them 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.570
 in this way this is not going to make us 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.930
 lack we remove it we go 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 and this is going to take a sandpaper and we 're going 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.400
 to sand down all the edges we're going to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.150
 put some kind of trim or something 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.390
 so that no 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:41.140
 we cut ourselves or nothing once we have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.360
 The edges will be fixed in this way 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.000
 and then it will not cut so much 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.280
 what we are going to do is either paint the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.650
 can here or put a liner on 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.810
 fabric a paper liner or whatever you want 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.450
 in this case I lined paper and 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.820
 it would be something like that what we can do 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.870
 is to make little pictures or paint it and 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.610
 we would have our vase made with a 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.560
 I hope you have served 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 utility the tutorial a greeting
