about that i know that i just figured
this<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.500> quick<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.829> do<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.070> like<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.250> i

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
this is so quick to do it like that i

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.560 
this is so quick to do it like that i
mean<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:31.000> know<00:03:31.030> what's<00:03:31.450> hard<00:03:31.570> about<00:03:31.720> that

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
mean you know what's hard about that

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.420 
mean you know what's hard about that
okay<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.630> we<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:34.900> our<00:03:35.079> basic<00:03:35.470> columns<00:03:36.130> that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
okay so we have our basic columns that

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.650 
okay so we have our basic columns that
the<00:03:36.579> explosion<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:37.180> going<00:03:37.329> to<00:03:37.420> catch

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
the explosion is going to catch

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.509 
the explosion is going to catch
outwardly<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:41.470> put<00:03:41.650> one<00:03:41.799> more<00:03:41.950> column<00:03:42.250> in

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
outwardly and it put one more column in

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:52.040 
outwardly and it put one more column in
the<00:03:42.609> middle

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.330 

hmm<00:03:54.900> do<00:03:55.900> half<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.380> what<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.770> other<00:03:56.890> thing<00:03:57.160> was

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
hmm do half of what the other thing was

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:08.100 
hmm do half of what the other thing was
5<00:03:57.760> by<00:04:00.090> 50<00:04:01.090> cent<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:03.520> that<00:04:06.780> okay<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:07.930> bit

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
5 by 50 cent to that okay a little bit

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.380 
5 by 50 cent to that okay a little bit
explanation<00:04:08.740> here<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.130> reason<00:04:09.520> that<00:04:09.550> I'm<00:04:09.910> we

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
explanation here the reason that I'm we

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.040 
explanation here the reason that I'm we
make<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.780> ground<00:04:11.020> plane<00:04:11.380> with<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:11.800> many<00:04:13.050> faces

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
make the ground plane with so many faces

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.970 
make the ground plane with so many faces
and<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:14.530> one<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.800> because<00:04:14.920> ray<00:04:15.190> fire

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
and this one is because ray fire

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.010 
and this one is because ray fire
sometimes<00:04:17.980> has<00:04:18.250> detecting<00:04:19.060> or<00:04:19.300> has<00:04:19.570> trouble

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
sometimes has detecting or has trouble

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
sometimes has detecting or has trouble
detecting<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:24.540> faces<00:04:25.540> if<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:26.200> if<00:04:26.590> there<00:04:26.920> is

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
detecting on faces if the if there is

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.570 
detecting on faces if the if there is
not<00:04:27.250> enough<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:28.510> work<00:04:28.720> with<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.250> make<00:04:30.460> sure

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
not enough to work with so you make sure

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.240 
not enough to work with so you make sure
our<00:04:30.610> face<00:04:30.940> is<00:04:31.210> fairly<00:04:31.450> close<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.290> it'll<00:04:33.070> work

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
our face is fairly close and it'll work

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.900 
our face is fairly close and it'll work
out<00:04:33.430> should<00:04:33.850> work<00:04:34.030> out<00:04:34.120> okay<00:04:35.640> so<00:04:36.640> what<00:04:36.760> we're

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
out should work out okay so what we're

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.130 
out should work out okay so what we're
going<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.360> do<00:04:37.570> here<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:39.390> control<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.630> for<00:04:40.960> all

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
going to do here is control a for all

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.790 
going to do here is control a for all
just<00:04:41.620> unselect<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.400> ground<00:04:43.500> again<00:04:44.500> at<00:04:44.620> all

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
just unselect the ground again at all

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.600 
just unselect the ground again at all
these<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.220> our<00:04:45.370> impact<00:04:45.850> objects<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:54.340> know

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
these is our impact objects and you know

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:03.200 
these is our impact objects and you know
what<00:04:54.820> let's<00:04:57.540> let's<00:04:58.540> change<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.150 

pivot<00:05:04.210> point<00:05:04.509> of<00:05:04.720> these<00:05:04.900> columns<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.919> that

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
pivot point of these columns to that

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:19.100 
pivot point of these columns to that
center<00:05:06.669> column

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:26.630 

okay<00:05:19.890> good<00:05:20.780> so<00:05:21.780> I'll<00:05:22.530> have<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:22.890> ah<00:05:25.430> we<00:05:26.430> can

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
okay good so I'll have that ah we can

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.590 
okay good so I'll have that ah we can
change<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:28.400> relative<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.580> pivot<00:05:29.940> that

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
change this to relative to pivot that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.690 
change this to relative to pivot that
means<00:05:30.780> as<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.290> fragments<00:05:31.650> these<00:05:32.190> all<00:05:32.550> these

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
means as it fragments these all these

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.320 
means as it fragments these all these
objects<00:05:33.300> it's<00:05:33.570> going<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.170> fragment<00:05:34.800> them<00:05:38.330> it's

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
objects it's going to fragment them it's

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.470 
objects it's going to fragment them it's
going<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.570> fragment<00:05:40.110> them<00:05:40.290> relative<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.520> the

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
going to fragment them relative to the

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.140 
going to fragment them relative to the
individual
