setup<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.480> looking<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:09.900> videos

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
setup here when I was looking for videos

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.930 
setup here when I was looking for videos
on<00:00:10.410> how<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.160> didn't<00:00:11.400> find<00:00:11.519> any<00:00:11.730> very

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940

helpful videos a lot of forums were
helpful<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> figured<00:00:17.220> I'd<00:00:17.369> throw<00:00:17.400> something

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
helpful so I figured I'd throw something

right here right to write to a DVI make
sure<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.370> a

sure if you're going to use a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
sure if you're going to use a

DisplayPort or micro DisplayPort there

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
DisplayPort or micro DisplayPort there
are<00:01:01.500> two<00:01:01.710> different<00:01:02.190> types<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
are two different types which I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.039 
are two different types which I
struggled<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.899> active<00:01:04.650> type<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
struggled with an active type in a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.640 
struggled with an active type in a
passive<00:01:07.320> type<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> need<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> active<00:01:10.500> all

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
passive type so you need the active all

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.399 
passive type so you need the active all
the<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:11.090> type<00:01:12.090> alright<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> kind

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the time type alright so that's the kind

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.749 
the time type alright so that's the kind
that<00:01:13.619> works<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.689> am<00:01:15.689> using<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
that works right there I am using a

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
that works right there I am using a
radon<00:01:19.729> affinity<00:01:21.320> with<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> catalyst

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
radon affinity with the catalyst

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
radon affinity with the catalyst
converter<00:01:23.189> all<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.060> fun<00:01:24.330> fancy<00:01:24.600> stuff<00:01:25.080> right

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
converter all that fun fancy stuff right

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
converter all that fun fancy stuff right

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
difference between the two is this one's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.499

now if you're going to crossfire two
cards<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> only<00:02:00.750> things<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.140> need<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.439> know

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
cards the only things you need to know

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.030 
cards the only things you need to know
is<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.930> whether<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.200> they're<00:02:04.439> crossfire

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
is one whether or not they're crossfire

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.749 
is one whether or not they're crossfire
capable<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> other

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
capable like this and then the other

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
capable like this and then the other
thing<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.569> need<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.200> same

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
thing is they just need to be the same

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.180 
thing is they just need to be the same

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.770 

hopefully<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.520> doesn't<00:06:14.730> take<00:06:15.120> all<00:06:15.390> that

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
hopefully this doesn't take all that

it's<00:06:40.689> a<00:06:40.779> fractal<00:06:41.229> case<00:06:41.740> these<00:06:42.129> things<00:06:42.460> are

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
it's a fractal case these things are

it's a fractal case these things are
fantastic<00:06:44.349> cases<00:06:44.860> little<00:06:45.759> on<00:06:45.879> the<00:06:45.909> more

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
fantastic cases little on the more

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.439 
fantastic cases little on the more
expensive<00:06:46.479> side<00:06:46.960> but<00:06:46.990> I<00:06:47.939> still<00:06:48.939> think<00:06:49.270> they

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
expensive side but I still think they

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.189 
expensive side but I still think they
are<00:06:49.659> a<00:06:49.930> really<00:06:50.800> good<00:06:51.300> sound<00:06:52.300> dampening<00:06:52.900> foam

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
are a really good sound dampening foam

here for some hard drives just like on
the<00:07:00.249> bottom<00:07:00.610> four<00:07:00.879> slots<00:07:01.240> take<00:07:02.169> it<00:07:02.319> out<00:07:02.439> for

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
the bottom four slots take it out for

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.769 
the bottom four slots take it out for
some<00:07:02.800> air<00:07:02.949> flow<00:07:03.279> even<00:07:03.849> things<00:07:04.120> like<00:07:04.210> this<00:07:04.479> heat

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
some air flow even things like this heat

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.329 
some air flow even things like this heat
exchange<00:07:05.460> so<00:07:06.460> here<00:07:06.669> we<00:07:06.699> go<00:07:06.819> here<00:07:07.210> we<00:07:07.240> are<00:07:07.479> again

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:08.339 
exchange so here we go here we are again
