00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 servus and welcome to one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.540
 new like and again something new 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 in track has a phase the posts now 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.620
 again they do not really matter 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.969
 but are also important again but how 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.219
 they just do not understand 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.830
 a new picture popped up in front of a couple 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 hours and I'm really a half 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 hour to take the time to analyze 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 I can not find anything possible 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.470
 and somebody ware was so nice and has 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.150
 with photoshop these seven should 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.289
 merged and you know what you do 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 still do not know what it is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 no but you really do not recognize what 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 that should be i will pair now 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 things say what it could be 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.410
 who could not vote at all and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.660
 yes, definitely could for seven 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.950
 pillars stand seven days in seven 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 days comes a trailer u 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.309
 something like that, I do not know myself 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 I'll just say the whole thing 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.379
 things that can be it then somehow 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 an element 115 no idea then 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.180
 maybe a peckinpah tension 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.159
 excerpts of it or just one 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.680
 blackboard you have to lead together and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.970
 someone put together and one 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.420
 still does not recognize what it is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.390
 some say it is a puzzle 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.549
 classic puzzle and yes completely honest 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.990
 I can not tell you what I mean 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.400
 I can only show you 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.930
 You have a little here now 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 help with the merged 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.240
 but honestly, really bring something 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.850
 I do not find it but I still do 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 you can say you can see at the whole 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.259
 left pillar you can see a face though 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.790
 no human hair 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.030
 For me, it looks like a pig 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.079
 face or a teddy bear face 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.360
 maybe you can see it is 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.850
 Really hard to recognize but if he does 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.130
 You can see it coming in a bit and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.590
 the rest is really no plans could 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 be something mystical 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 definitely has something to do with zombies too 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.540
 do something with another 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.080
 thing which is also interesting is the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.960
 Heading of this picture was and one 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.459
 end double dot point and man 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.550
 knew the seven seconds before that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.440
 video had every story has one 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.830
 at the beginning so that has what you have to do 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.220
 it means that something with the new map 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.230
 has to do and what it could be it is 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.670
 namely, the giant could be because it 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.600
 is yes in the description of the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.780
 pointed out 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.970
 the giant emerges m imagine it 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.750
 to the zombies in them weapons factory 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.120
 it all started ending here too 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.100
 and now you might think that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.320
 first second stage has so with the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.989
 what to do and the last because of it 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.160
 here too what ends up doing so so 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.330
 We will definitely be the giant 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.380
 see or the giant somehow more 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.150
 I can not say 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.250
 I would be interested in what you are there 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.110
 I suspect because I am very heavy 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.680
 he liked make of it to analyze 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.750
 but yes you try your best and 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.540
 if I know something new about what 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.730
 I could immediately find something on facebook 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.530
 post or youtube 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.880
 Yes, that 's it. See you next time 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.880
 as the skin is pure and very good
