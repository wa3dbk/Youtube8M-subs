00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.110 

this<00:02:13.930> method<00:02:14.379> of<00:02:14.530> data<00:02:14.739> frame<00:02:15.159> is<00:02:15.400> much<00:02:15.640> easier

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
this method of data frame is much easier

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.630 
this method of data frame is much easier
but<00:02:16.959> some<00:02:17.319> people<00:02:17.680> also<00:02:17.739> use<00:02:18.010> another<00:02:18.430> method

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
but some people also use another method

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.759 
but some people also use another method
what<00:02:19.359> they<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:19.599> is<00:02:19.840> they<00:02:20.049> take<00:02:20.319> constant

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
what they do is they take constant

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.500 
what they do is they take constant
separately<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.640> their<00:02:22.000> eggs<00:02:22.090> separately

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
separately and their eggs separately

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.209 
separately and their eggs separately
they<00:02:23.079> dip<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.439> chicken<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:23.920> cornstarch

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
they dip the chicken in the cornstarch

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.360 
they dip the chicken in the cornstarch
and<00:02:24.670> then<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.319> egg<00:02:26.409> and<00:02:26.709> then<00:02:26.980> again<00:02:27.219> on

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
and then in the egg and then again on

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.309 
and then in the egg and then again on
the<00:02:27.430> constructs<00:02:27.849> they<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.719> that<00:02:28.930> thinking

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
the constructs they do that thinking

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.839 
the constructs they do that thinking
that<00:02:29.469> if<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.680> give<00:02:29.829> a<00:02:29.859> double<00:02:30.189> coating<00:02:30.609> of<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
that if you give a double coating of the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.089 
that if you give a double coating of the
