 it is necessary for the potatoes not 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.170
 turned black in the oven and whatever it was 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.200
 crispy top and soft inside here 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.100

 boil no more than one or two minutes 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.250
 because potatoes contain a lot 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.380

 and pour a baking sheet 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:16.120
 you need to put the potatoes in one layer 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:19.940
 lest it fall one on top of another 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.300
 cook potatoes in the oven already heated 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.680
 up to 200 degrees 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.190
 35-40 minutes if you need to mix 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.190

 again I leave potatoes for 20 minutes 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:04.360
 turned white crunchy on top and 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.360
