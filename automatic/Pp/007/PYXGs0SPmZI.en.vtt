00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.160
 and so the whole world today is discussing the new 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.160
 spurt to grow in the field of weapons best on 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.259
 the planet has no analogues such epithets 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 Now the most popular in Western 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.059
 journalists discussing something 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.860
 the newest Russian tank and others 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.780
 fighting vehicles created on the platform 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.090
 Armata despite the fact that many 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.870
 the characteristics of the novelties are still strictly 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.690
 classified 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.970
 on the eve of the parade rehearsal they are all 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.129
 first appeared without covers 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.660
 detailed photos posted in 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.390
 internet and ministry of defense 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 Alexander Samokhvalov found out what Armata 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.469
 struck everyone without a shot about him 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.330
 there was a lot of talk but for the first time this 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.210
 amateur video gave an idea of 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.369
 how does armata t-14 look like 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.690
 Russian tank fifth generation tower 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.009
 under the tarpaulin additionally 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.220
 disguised as boxes 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.289
 and this is the latest rehearsal footage 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.899
 parade familiar one hundred seventy two 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.550
 silhouette 90 second car commanders 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.190
 salute being in a familiar place 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.740
 the tower and here it is a brand new 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.869
 armat tank pay attention to the tower 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.179
 nobody there she is uninhabited there only 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.690
 projectiles automatic control charging 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.179
 shooting 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.580
 whole crew armor capsule front 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:42.789
 Armor Corps presence of those 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.039
 or other means of firing in this 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.440
 missile missile case all 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.509
 this is for now 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.890
 relate to categories secretly home 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.080
 a task that was solved 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.209
 designer crew protection tankers 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.950
 survive even with a direct hit even 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.440
 if the tank gun rips 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 accelerates in seconds not tens as 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.289
 earlier namely in seconds to 60 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.989
 kilometers an hour 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.599
 125 mm gun designed for 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.220
 rocket launch the tank itself finds the target and a 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.050
 during the fight is capable of closed 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.090
 communication channels exchange data with 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.640
 infantry other tanks drone 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.340
 pva artillery in theory this is called 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.200
 city center war from the word network 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.450
 for the first time in practice it is applied 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.560
 Americans but the theory was born in 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.349
 domestic kb 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.180
 we have already 80s such a system was 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.489
 created here but 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.200
 on tadane went only because 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.750
 that the identity of the composition was not ready here 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.290
 computerization to automation that is 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.700
 it was hard 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.799
 automated control system 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.739
 the marshal was the ideologue of which 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.599
 Nikolai Ogarkov tested back in the 80s 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.430
 restructuring and collapse of the ussr 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.200
 many domestic secrets have become 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.349
 subject to careful study on 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.780
 West essentially Sarmats our military-industrial complex 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.090
 catching up the lost tower uninhabited 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.409
 communications complex and weapons superior 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.239
 all existing tanks 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.189
 he is the embodiment of ambition 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.109
 colossal rearmament program 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.750
 which the Russian army should replace 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.030
 70 percent of their weapons 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.950
 modern equipment in 2020 and 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.540
 daily mail writes that this is the first 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.329
 new tank since the end of the cold 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.340
 wars analogues of our t-14 and the truth 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.680
 virtually no south korean black 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 panther close to the armament of communication but in 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.219
 towers commander and gunner 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.739
 when hit they will die first 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.169
 invincible tank invisible tank ghost 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.030
 able to protect their native land this 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.750
 the image has already begun to loom in the Russian 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.209
 cinema 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.470
 three years ago at the presentation 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.720
 picture white tiger 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.819
 director Karen Shakhnazarov then said 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.310
 that those who are now rewriting the past 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:50.040
 will lead the world to a new war war 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:55.590
 ended at the expense of the budget 20 years 50 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.590
 courage and release 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.260
 when installing more often the tank as the basis 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.900
 land forces will not lose for a long time 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.490
 Armat's relevance is essentially a platform 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.620
 universal for tanks and 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.730
 artillery systems heavy combat 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.950
 infantry vehicles 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.320
 you can even move the engine from the back 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.780
 parts ahead if it's bmp and need 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.160
 to transport infantrymen only three dozen 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.260
 transformation options 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.330
 such a breakthrough in tank building our 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.330
 defense did not survive more than half a century
