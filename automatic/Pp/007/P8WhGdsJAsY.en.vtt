we're<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.100> be<00:00:02.190> taking<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> look<00:00:02.639> at<00:00:02.820> the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
we're going to be taking a look at the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.610 
we're going to be taking a look at the
supercard<00:00:03.540> dstwo<00:00:04.490> this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.910> 3ds<00:00:06.899> flash<00:00:07.350> card

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620

there DSi XL DSi DS Lite normal DS and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.660 
there DSi XL DSi DS Lite normal DS and
what<00:00:15.750> makes<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.139> different<00:00:16.199> than<00:00:16.770> say<00:00:17.400> your

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
what makes this different than say your

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.929 
what makes this different than say your
you<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.500> r4i<00:00:19.500> 3ds<00:00:19.949> gold<00:00:20.279> which<00:00:20.550> runs<00:00:20.760> about

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you know r4i 3ds gold which runs about

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.500 
you know r4i 3ds gold which runs about
20<00:00:21.240> bucks

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
20 bucks

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
20 bucks
what<00:00:21.930> makes<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.350> difference<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
what makes this difference is that the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.630 
what makes this difference is that the
supercard<00:00:24.570> dstwo<00:00:25.070> actually<00:00:26.070> has<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.430> built

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
supercard dstwo actually has it's built

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.630 
supercard dstwo actually has it's built
it<00:00:26.910> has<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> built<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.720> cpu<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.859> allows<00:00:29.220> for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
it has a built in cpu which allows for

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
it has a built in cpu which allows for
more<00:00:29.820> advanced<00:00:30.150> features<00:00:30.630> let<00:00:30.840> me<00:00:30.929> just

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
more advanced features let me just

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720 
more advanced features let me just
symbol<00:00:31.410> us<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.679> show<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> works<00:00:32.460> as

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
symbol us and show you how it works as

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.510 
symbol us and show you how it works as
you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> Left<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
you can see here on the Left we have the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
you can see here on the Left we have the
supercard<00:00:35.520> dstwo<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.140> have

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
supercard dstwo and on the right we have

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920 
supercard dstwo and on the right we have
an<00:00:37.410> R<00:00:37.559> 4i<00:00:37.829> 3ds<00:00:38.430> gold<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
an R 4i 3ds gold and as you can see the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.560 
an R 4i 3ds gold and as you can see the
production<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.860> both<00:00:41.550> cards<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.090> completely

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
production of both cards are completely

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
production of both cards are completely
different<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.710> left<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
different on the left you can see that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
different on the left you can see that
the<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> has<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.410> giant<00:00:46.820> CPU<00:00:47.820> chip<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the it has a giant CPU chip which is the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.600 
the it has a giant CPU chip which is the
large<00:00:49.860> ship<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.250> here

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
large ship right here

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.979 
large ship right here
that's<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> allow<00:00:51.239> us<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.780> more

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that's going to allow us for more

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
that's going to allow us for more
advanced<00:00:52.260> features<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.190> supercard<00:00:53.579> dstwo

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
advanced features so the supercard dstwo

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
advanced features so the supercard dstwo
is<00:00:54.059> better<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.989> built<00:00:55.289> in

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
is better because it has this built in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
is better because it has this built in
CPU<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.550> allows<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.660> things<00:00:57.930> such<00:00:58.109> as

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
CPU which allows it to do things such as

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.290 
CPU which allows it to do things such as
emulate<00:00:58.800> Gameboy<00:00:59.190> Advance<00:00:59.489> games<00:00:59.789> which

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
emulate Gameboy Advance games which

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
emulate Gameboy Advance games which
these<00:01:00.539> cars<00:01:00.780> simply<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.379> cannot<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.859> let's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
these cars simply just cannot do let's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
these cars simply just cannot do let's
go<00:01:02.280> ahead<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:02.969> further<00:01:03.390> look<00:01:03.660> into<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
go ahead and take further look into the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
go ahead and take further look into the
supercard<00:01:04.589> dstwo<00:01:05.000> alright<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.150> here's<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
supercard dstwo alright so here's the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.570 
supercard dstwo alright so here's the
supercard<00:01:06.960> dstwo

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
supercard dstwo

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.880 
supercard dstwo
the<00:01:08.580> actual<00:01:09.090> unit<00:01:09.420> itself<00:01:09.590> assembled<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the actual unit itself assembled as you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.170 
the actual unit itself assembled as you
can<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> sticker<00:01:11.549> looks<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
can see the sticker looks like it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
can see the sticker looks like it
actually<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.630> covering<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.229> lumps<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
actually is covering some lumps and you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.499 
actually is covering some lumps and you
can<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> circuit<00:01:15.330> board

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
can actually see the circuit board

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.210 
can actually see the circuit board
underneath<00:01:15.750> aesthetic<00:01:16.409> wise<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
underneath aesthetic wise it's not the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
underneath aesthetic wise it's not the
best<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.880> know<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.180> does<00:01:18.570> not

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
best but you know it really does not

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
best but you know it really does not
matter<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:20.220> makes<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.580> card<00:01:20.850> shine<00:01:21.119> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
matter now what makes this card shine is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.749 
matter now what makes this card shine is
that<00:01:21.689> CPU<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.619> talking<00:01:22.740> about<00:01:23.009> but

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that CPU like I was talking about but

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630 
that CPU like I was talking about but
also<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.330> has<00:01:24.540> very<00:01:24.990> great<00:01:25.530> support<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.520> the

have that on on the chip CPU we have

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.960 
have that on on the chip CPU we have
some<00:03:16.859> we<00:03:17.129> can<00:03:17.220> do<00:03:17.340> some<00:03:17.519> on-the-fly

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
modifications hold on it's a LR start

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.190 
modifications hold on it's a LR start
and<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.209> do<00:03:24.359> some<00:03:24.660> on-the-fly

and we can do some on-the-fly
modifications<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.730> actually<00:03:27.060> done<00:03:27.239> on

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
modifications this is actually done on

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.420 
modifications this is actually done on
the<00:03:27.660> thing<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.079> actually<00:03:28.169> slo-mo<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the thing we can actually slo-mo the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.069 
the thing we can actually slo-mo the
game<00:03:29.639> down<00:03:30.620> 75%<00:03:32.329> so<00:03:33.329> we<00:03:33.720> go<00:03:33.870> back<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.049> can

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
game down 75% so we go back and we can

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.720 
game down 75% so we go back and we can
actually<00:03:37.349> slow<00:03:37.950> make<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.669> game<00:03:38.910> run<00:03:39.200> slow-mo

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
actually slow make this game run slow-mo

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.009 
actually slow make this game run slow-mo
which<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.880> pretty<00:03:42.060> cool<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:42.870> get

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
which is pretty cool and you can get

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.460 
which is pretty cool and you can get
that<00:03:43.139> option<00:03:43.799> by<00:03:43.950> hitting<00:03:44.280> LR<00:03:44.790> start<00:03:45.470> there's

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that option by hitting LR start there's
