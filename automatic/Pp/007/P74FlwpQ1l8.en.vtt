00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
exhaust is 26 and intake is ten and you

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.770 
exhaust is 26 and intake is ten and you
adjust<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.790> injectors<00:00:20.210> with<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.450> height

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
adjust the injectors with a height

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.600 
adjust the injectors with a height

measurement of eighty two point one

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.420 
measurement of eighty two point one
millimeters<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.440> order<00:00:24.770> is<00:00:24.890> you're<00:00:25.130> just

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
millimeters and the order is you're just

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.880 
millimeters and the order is you're just
injected<00:00:25.940> number<00:00:26.180> one<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.630> you're<00:00:27.470> just<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
injected number one and you're just the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.190 
injected number one and you're just the
Pistons<00:00:28.280> that<00:00:28.430> go<00:00:28.580> up<00:00:28.700> you're<00:00:29.450> just<00:00:29.480> about<00:00:29.990> to

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
Pistons that go up you're just about to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.019 
Pistons that go up you're just about to
go<00:00:30.350> up<00:00:30.440> with<00:00:30.560> that<00:00:30.740> pistons<00:00:31.130> ready<00:00:31.370> number<00:00:31.610> six

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
go up with that pistons ready number six

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.630 
go up with that pistons ready number six
and<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.870> go<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.290> firing<00:00:33.500> order<00:00:33.950> based<00:00:34.430> off

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
and you go in the firing order based off

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.480 
and you go in the firing order based off
the<00:00:34.790> injector<00:00:35.240> so<00:00:35.960> after<00:00:36.500> injector<00:00:37.370> you're

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
the injector so after injector you're

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.310 
the injector so after injector you're
just<00:00:37.790> injected<00:00:38.240> number<00:00:38.450> one<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.930> thousand

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
just injected number one and thousand

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.730 
just injected number one and thousand
number<00:00:39.500> six<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:40.730> do<00:00:41.290> injector<00:00:42.290> number<00:00:42.530> five

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
number six you do injector number five

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.710 
number six you do injector number five
and<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.010> piston<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.579> valve<00:00:44.090> go<00:00:44.360> up<00:00:44.420> with<00:00:44.570> that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
and the piston the valve go up with that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.319 
and the piston the valve go up with that
business<00:00:44.900> rugby<00:00:45.410> on<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.670> valves<00:00:46.970> from<00:00:47.000> number

business rugby on the valves from number

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.520 
business rugby on the valves from number
two<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.550> here<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.840> order<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.230> kind<00:00:54.440> of

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
two and here it is the order is kind of

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.010 
two and here it is the order is kind of
confusing<00:00:56.050> but<00:00:57.050> basically<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:59.600> see<00:00:59.840> when

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
confusing but basically you you see when

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.239 
confusing but basically you you see when
a<00:01:00.050> just<00:01:00.680> injector<00:01:01.220> with<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.520> valve<00:01:01.730> overlap

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
a just injector with the valve overlap

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.919 
a just injector with the valve overlap
spare<00:01:04.249> that's<00:01:04.399> better

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:04.929 
spare that's better

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:13.490 
spare that's better
only<00:01:05.929> I'll<00:01:06.020> go<00:01:06.200> keep<00:01:06.380> on<00:01:06.590> killing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:28.950 

there<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.410> an<00:01:20.500> overlap<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.190> didn't<00:01:21.670> move

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.930 

now<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.530> ingest<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.160> objective<00:01:30.640> with<00:01:30.790> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
now you ingest the objective with the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:55.940 
now you ingest the objective with the
height<00:01:31.120> measurement

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.300 

after<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> finish<00:01:57.210> suggesting<00:01:57.750> injective

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
after you finish suggesting injective

after you finish suggesting injective
number<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.750> you're<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> valves<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
piston that goes up with it so I be

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660 

you<00:02:45.409> don't<00:02:45.620> want<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.829> keep<00:02:45.950> people<00:02:46.010> saying

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you don't want to keep people saying

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.069 
you don't want to keep people saying
things<00:02:46.939> in<00:02:47.090> class<00:02:47.360> get<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:47.750> right<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.049> first

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
things in class get it right the first

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.050

time

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
I was goofing off the trip but we're not

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.180 
I was goofing off the trip but we're not
off<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> chicken<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.530> trips<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.010> we've

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
off the chicken on the trips that we've

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.790 
off the chicken on the trips that we've
taken<00:03:03.370> instructs<00:03:04.200> trip<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.850> state<00:03:06.850> passed<00:03:07.180> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800

rule in thousands of miles every day and

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.700 
rule in thousands of miles every day and
he's<00:03:13.090> doing<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.720> be<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.930> greatest<00:03:14.170> trucks<00:03:14.530> on

he's doing to be the greatest trucks on

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:43.380 
he's doing to be the greatest trucks on
my<00:03:15.330> break<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:17.470> tell

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:04:41.679 

okay

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.659 

and<00:04:42.689> after<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.139> adjust<00:04:43.289> injector<00:04:44.069> number<00:04:44.399> one

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
and after you adjust injector number one

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.419 
and after you adjust injector number one
and<00:04:44.969> the<00:04:45.479> valve<00:04:45.689> number<00:04:45.989> six<00:04:46.379> you<00:04:47.039> go<00:04:47.219> on<00:04:47.309> the

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:47.429 
and the valve number six you go on the

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:50.529 
and the valve number six you go on the
firing<00:04:47.819> order<00:04:47.939> based<00:04:48.269> off<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.629> injector<00:04:49.339> so

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
firing order based off the injector so

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.389 
firing order based off the injector so
you<00:04:51.539> wait<00:04:51.779> for<00:04:52.019> the<00:04:52.139> valve<00:04:52.739> overlap<00:04:53.069> on

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:53.399 
you wait for the valve overlap on

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.279 
you wait for the valve overlap on
injector<00:04:54.179> number<00:04:54.479> five<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:57.300> you'll

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
injector number five and then you'll

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.109 
injector number five and then you'll
adjust<00:04:58.439> about<00:04:59.009> to<00:04:59.189> go<00:04:59.309> up<00:04:59.429> with<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.729> person

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:00.119 
adjust about to go up with that person

00:05:00.119 --> 00:06:11.860 
adjust about to go up with that person
so<00:05:00.839> it'd<00:05:00.929> be<00:05:01.080> number<00:05:01.409> two

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.189
