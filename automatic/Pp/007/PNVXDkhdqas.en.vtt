00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
pre the way it size wise in the way it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.780 
pre the way it size wise in the way it
feels<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.680> hand<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> quite<00:00:38.520> nice

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to say that it's a bad phone but it is

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.339 
to say that it's a bad phone but it is
very<00:03:19.919> slow<00:03:20.519> slower<00:03:21.239> than<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.540> would<00:03:21.690> expect<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
very slow slower than I would expect you

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.680 
very slow slower than I would expect you
can<00:03:22.560> see<00:03:22.769> there<00:03:22.919> we<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.310> come<00:03:23.519> as<00:03:23.700> taking<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
can see there we go it come as taking a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.270 
can see there we go it come as taking a
moment<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.079> pick<00:03:25.440> up<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.829> think<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.220> is

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
moment to pick up and I think this is

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.759 
moment to pick up and I think this is
this<00:03:26.609> phone's<00:03:26.910> main<00:03:27.419> downfall<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.470> speed

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
this phone's main downfall is the speed

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.819 
this phone's main downfall is the speed
is<00:03:28.919> just<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.459> up<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.849> par<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.959> guess<00:03:31.590> with<00:03:31.799> a

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
is just not up to par I guess with a

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.740 
is just not up to par I guess with a
free<00:03:32.099> phone<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.549> not<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:32.910> bad<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.389> compared

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
free phone it's not so bad and compared

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.580 
free phone it's not so bad and compared
to<00:03:33.780> some<00:03:33.959> others<00:03:34.549> but<00:03:35.629> it<00:03:36.629> just<00:03:36.930> doesn't<00:03:37.139> feel

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
to some others but it just doesn't feel

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.789 
to some others but it just doesn't feel
like<00:03:38.060> what<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.180> would<00:03:39.299> expect<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.500> let's<00:03:40.650> go

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
like what you would expect so let's go

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.009 
like what you would expect so let's go
back<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.010> home<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.359> does<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.510> haptic

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
back to home and it does have haptic

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.659 
back to home and it does have haptic
feedback<00:03:43.049> i<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:43.980> think<00:03:44.160> i<00:03:44.220> mentioned<00:03:44.400> that

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
feedback i don't think i mentioned that

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.759 
feedback i don't think i mentioned that
so<00:03:45.209> if<00:03:45.510> we<00:03:45.720> hit<00:03:45.840> these<00:03:46.049> buttons<00:03:46.379> these<00:03:46.530> are<00:03:46.650> our

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
so if we hit these buttons these are our

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.000 
so if we hit these buttons these are our
phone<00:03:46.980> buttons<00:03:47.599> this<00:03:48.599> is<00:03:48.750> pick<00:03:49.169> up<00:03:49.199> and<00:03:49.590> hang

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
phone buttons this is pick up and hang

phone buttons this is pick up and hang
up<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:51.049> they<00:03:52.049> are<00:03:52.199> these<00:03:52.560> are<00:03:52.739> actually

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
up and they are these are actually

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.430 
up and they are these are actually
rubber<00:03:53.250> buttons<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.940> there<00:03:54.540> they're<00:03:55.169> pushed

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
rubber buttons and there they're pushed

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.140 
rubber buttons and there they're pushed
out<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.889> obviously<00:03:56.310> being<00:03:56.669> that<00:03:56.879> this<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.120> a

and<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.880> does<00:05:18.060> work<00:05:18.330> but<00:05:18.600> again<00:05:18.930> it's<00:05:19.500> on<00:05:19.740> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
and it does work but again it's on the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.920 
and it does work but again it's on the

that<00:05:22.110> part<00:05:22.380> nose<00:05:22.760> feels<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.850> little<00:05:23.970> choppy

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
that part nose feels a little choppy

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.210 
that part nose feels a little choppy
it's<00:05:24.660> definitely<00:05:25.169> usable<00:05:25.650> but<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:26.010> type

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
it's definitely usable but the type

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.219 
it's definitely usable but the type
right<00:05:26.520> now<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:26.940> blurry<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.479> can't<00:05:27.810> read<00:05:28.080> it

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
right now is so blurry I can't read it

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.379 
right now is so blurry I can't read it
so<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:29.160> would<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.430> zoom<00:05:29.699> in<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:30.030> read<00:05:30.210> the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
so you would have to zoom in to read the

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.490 
so you would have to zoom in to read the
type<00:05:30.570> on<00:05:30.780> here<00:05:30.810> let<00:05:31.410> me<00:05:31.500> show<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:33.500> it's

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
type on here let me show you that it's

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.260 
type on here let me show you that it's
it's<00:05:34.979> kind<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.460> hard<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.729> read<00:05:35.940> because<00:05:36.090> you

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
it's kind of hard to read because you

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.700 
it's kind of hard to read because you
can<00:05:36.419> actually<00:05:36.450> see<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:37.050> pixels<00:05:37.380> in<00:05:37.530> this

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
can actually see the pixels in this

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.670 
can actually see the pixels in this
camera<00:05:38.100> I<00:05:38.940> mean<00:05:39.750> up<00:05:39.930> close<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:40.350> have<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:40.530> bring

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
camera I mean up close I have to bring

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.469 
camera I mean up close I have to bring
it<00:05:40.770> up<00:05:40.830> pretty<00:05:41.039> close<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.550> see<00:05:41.760> it<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:42.360> just

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
it up pretty close to see it it just

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.469 
it up pretty close to see it it just
doesn't<00:05:42.990> look<00:05:43.200> up<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:44.669> snuff<00:05:44.910> and<00:05:45.090> that's<00:05:45.270> due

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
doesn't look up to snuff and that's due

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.390 
doesn't look up to snuff and that's due
to<00:05:45.570> its<00:05:45.720> lower<00:05:45.930> resolution<00:05:46.650> but<00:05:46.860> again<00:05:47.190> if
