opposing<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.190> shaking<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.820> one<00:02:29.060> that's

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
opposing the shaking in this one that's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.570 
opposing the shaking in this one that's
a<00:02:29.510> great<00:02:29.720> question<00:02:30.080> actually<00:02:30.290> most<00:02:31.130> cocktails

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
a great question actually most cocktails

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.390 
a great question actually most cocktails
that<00:02:31.670> have<00:02:32.000> sugars<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.990> citrus<00:02:33.560> require<00:02:34.010> a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
that have sugars and citrus require a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.860 
that have sugars and citrus require a
shake<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.120> helps<00:02:35.360> integrate<00:02:35.570> and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
shake because it helps integrate and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.150 
shake because it helps integrate and
break<00:02:36.020> down<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> sugars<00:02:36.620> into<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.980> cocktail

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
break down the sugars into the cocktail

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.580 
break down the sugars into the cocktail
since<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.270> all<00:02:38.450> spirits<00:02:39.080> for<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.410> most

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
since this is all spirits for the most

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.140 
since this is all spirits for the most
part<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.430> needs<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.670> stir<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.030> what

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
part it just needs a stir and what

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.210 
part it just needs a stir and what
that's<00:02:41.300> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.570> achieve<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.620> more<00:02:42.830> even

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
that's going to achieve is a more even

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800 
that's going to achieve is a more even
dilution<00:02:43.700> that's<00:02:44.060> gonna<00:02:44.150> do<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.540> little<00:02:44.630> bit

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
dilution that's gonna do it a little bit

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.390 
dilution that's gonna do it a little bit
slower<00:02:45.020> because<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> want<00:02:45.680> these<00:02:45.860> stronger

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
slower because I want these stronger

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.880 
slower because I want these stronger
flavors<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.970> pop<00:02:47.180> out<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:48.170> not<00:02:48.350> going<00:02:48.680> to

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
flavors to pop out and it's not going to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.870 
flavors to pop out and it's not going to
it's<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.340> it's<00:02:49.459> gonna<00:02:49.550> give<00:02:49.730> me<00:02:49.790> that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880
