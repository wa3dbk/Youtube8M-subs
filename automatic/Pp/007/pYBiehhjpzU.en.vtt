00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.770
 At the end of May, a military beta test started. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.830
 action armored warfare fight here 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.810
 to be on modern tanks and this 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.810
 means the best weapon 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.590
 heaped powerful defense systems 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.960
 engines and speed beta tester armored 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.730
 warfare is now available more 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530
 fifty models of military equipment 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.440
 created in the last few 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 decades and today we will tell you about 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 5 most interesting cars 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.799
 the choice the first one may seem for 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.799
 someone weird italian wheeled 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.229
 tank destroyer b1 centauro wrong 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 famous as t-80 or leopard 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.940
 however, he shows best 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.610
 the main difference armored warfare 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.210
 from other similar games even easy 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.899
 the car may be in the right hands 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 deadly opponent in the game 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.690
 can be tested as a basic version 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.750
 cars and modernized centauro 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:41.369
 155 equipped with a powerful caliber gun 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.410
 155 millimeters both armored cars are much 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.320
 faster than any tank so they can 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.970
 first to take a favorable position 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.119
 suddenly shoot at enemies and quickly 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.700
 get to a safe distance 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.350
 the main thing is to move as much as possible 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.590
 like the rest of the cars in this class 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 Armor for something I'm lying very weak therefore 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.340
 open battle with a real tank he 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.340
 still lose 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.500
 but in order to bully the heavyweights 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.069
 it is not necessary to choose wheeled 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 armored car 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.959
 there are enough fast tanks in the game and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.569
 among them are many russian and soviet 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.390
 machines the fact is that in the years of cold 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.180
 wars in the world 2 different 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.190
 tank school western school did 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.980
 emphasis on heavy vehicles with strong armor 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.230
 and powerful weapons but the soviet 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.810
 tanks hung almost half as much 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.739
 but they were faster and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.630
 maneuverable 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.110
 the top of the Soviet development 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.790
 tank building became t-80 designers 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.730
 gas turbine installed on it 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.920
 the engine that accelerates the tank to 70 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.620
 kilometers per hour and provides him 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.260
 excellent dynamics but the engine has become 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.739
 and the main drawback of the war machine is he 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.140
 one cost the whole t-64 tank 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.030
 but after the designers succeeded 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.250
 raise the effectiveness of traditional 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.569
 diesel engines from gas turbines 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.299
 units refused 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.900
 latest russian tanks like t-90 and 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.849
 mattress 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.849
 diesel engines are used 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.329
 in armored warfare d80 bribes its 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.340
 mobility tank almost does not lag behind 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.680
 light armored vehicles fast 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.370
 turns around and his armor stands 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.590
 several hits from a powerful gun 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.049
 in addition, the t-80 has a very small body 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.319
 so getting into it will be wrong 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.319
 simply 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.690
 the exact opposite of t-80 german 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.740
 tank leopard is a huge machine with 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.780
 chopped forms 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.970
 least like fast and 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.370
 graceful cat in honor of which her 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.440
 named however dimensions allowed 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.670
 Designer to allocate enough space. 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.850
 for equipment and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.200
 crew and also ensure the tank is very 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.660
 decent booking 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.120
 2 leopard is one of the most popular 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.880
 tanks in the world just produced more 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:24.570
 3000 cars which are in addition to the Bundeswehr 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:27.000
 serving in their army another 16 countries in beta 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.850
 armored warfare there are just three 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.170
 modifications of 2 leopards each of which 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.840
 they can be equipped 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.540
 various modules has circulated on leopard 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.790
 maximum player will get one of the most 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.560
 tech cars in the game there is 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.780
 almost everything from huge 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.910
 range of ammunition to the complex 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.040
 active defenses that knock down 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.400
 enemy fired missiles at 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.400
 approaching 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.350
 another interesting German development 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.810
 represented in this armored warfare 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.960
 self propelled gun pisa h2000 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.639
 in the 90s of the last century 2 thousand 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.040
 it was decided to write on all that 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.040
 the opinion of the authors will definitely overtake his 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.500
 case spezi h2000 time 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.160
 so it happened for almost 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.770
 20 years this particular machine holds 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.560
 the title of the most perfect of all serially 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.230
 produced in the world physic carries 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.600
 the most powerful gun that is just 9 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.480
 seconds can release three shells on 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.340
 distance up to 30 kilometers this 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.419
 self-propelled gun even set a record for 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.030
 firing range 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:47.840
 firing a velib missile on 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:50.390
 56 km distance to armored 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.060
 h2000 warfare bizet will suit players 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.700
 who love and know how to act in 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.840
 the team on it is by no means worth it 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.060
 fight forehead 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.919
 This machine is designed to 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.760
 bring down artillery fire on enemies 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.850
 which reveal intelligence by the way 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.470
 play artillery in armored warfare 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.650
 harder than other tank games 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.640
 so the commander of pisa and 4000 must 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.640
 be able to disguise 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.070
 like any self propelled guns and sow 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.080
 need a couple quick scout 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.600
 for example bmd-4 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.640
 Soviet and Russian designers of 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.490
 rightly can be proud of these machines 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.010
 because bmd can parachute along with 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:41.000
 crew and engage immediately after 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.220
 There are no landings in the game yet. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.010
 which bmd-4 could crank this 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.590
 trick but even without it a tiny battle 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.170
 the car remains very useful for any 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.020
 groups excellent speed maneuverability and 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.840
 stealth make it the best choice 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.850
 for intelligence but if necessary she 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.230
 can even attack a powerful tank 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.230
 hitting rockets at him 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.210
 on this until everything is open 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.550
 testing armored warfare 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.589
 there is very little time therefore 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.249
 ride on these and many others 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:22.559
 combat vehicles will soon be able to anyone 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:25.139
 we promise not to forget about the game and 

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:28.969
 regularly back to it see you soon 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.969
 meetings and thanks for watching
