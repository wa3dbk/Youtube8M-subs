00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
amount of waste product for example that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.849 
amount of waste product for example that
a<00:00:56.969> chicken<00:00:57.300> would<00:00:57.510> put<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> week<00:00:58.590> a

a chicken would put out in a week a

a chicken would put out in a week a
large<00:00:59.190> dog<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.850> out<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.210> day<00:01:00.449> and

large dog would put out in one day and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
large dog would put out in one day and
of<00:01:01.079> course<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> case<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> chickens<00:01:02.309> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
of course in the case of chickens you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.889 
of course in the case of chickens you
actually<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> waste<00:01:03.300> product<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
actually use the waste product as a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.260 
actually use the waste product as a
fertilizer<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> bonus<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.729> opposed<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
fertilizer so it's a bonus as opposed to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
fertilizer so it's a bonus as opposed to
something<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.110> dispose<00:01:07.950> of

tray in the bottom of the a glue that we
pull<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.060> dump<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> into<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> compost

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pull out and we dump it into the compost

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.100 
pull out and we dump it into the compost
bin<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> layer<00:01:46.829> some<00:01:47.100> leaves<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.490> top<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
bin and layer some leaves on top this is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
bin and layer some leaves on top this is
the<00:01:49.229> egg<00:01:49.380> blue<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> main<00:01:50.579> part<00:01:50.850> here

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the egg blue this is the main part here

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
the egg blue this is the main part here
this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.110> roost<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.560> night<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this is where they roost at night and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.429 
this is where they roost at night and
this<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.220> where<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.520> lay<00:01:53.700> their<00:01:53.729> eggs<00:01:54.439> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this is where they lay their eggs so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.959 
this is where they lay their eggs so
that's<00:01:55.829> about<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.369> terms<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.670> daily

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that's about it in terms of daily

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760 
that's about it in terms of daily
maintenance<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.450> open<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.110> take<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.530> eggs

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
maintenance I open it up I take the eggs

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
open that part of the coop oh it's a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.820 
open that part of the coop oh it's a
simple<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.989> how<00:02:12.989> much<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:13.379> eat<00:02:13.530> and

what<00:02:14.129> do<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.280> eat<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.819> by<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> layer<00:02:15.900> smash<00:02:16.260> for

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
what do they eat I by a layer smash for

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.070 
what do they eat I by a layer smash for
them<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.400> layers<00:02:17.610> mash<00:02:18.049> consists<00:02:19.049> of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
them and the layers mash consists of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.869 
them and the layers mash consists of
different<00:02:19.470> kinds<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.799> grains<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.640> about

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
different kinds of grains it's about

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.880 
different kinds of grains it's about
think<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:21.840> about<00:02:21.959> fifteen<00:02:22.349> percent<00:02:22.620> protein

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
think it's about fifteen percent protein

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.300 
think it's about fifteen percent protein
which<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> laying<00:02:24.269> hen<00:02:24.360> needs<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.900> eat

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
which is what a laying hen needs to eat

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.009 
which is what a laying hen needs to eat
they<00:02:26.310> eat<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.120> summertime<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.870> eat<00:02:27.989> a

they eat in the summertime they eat a

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.539 
they eat in the summertime they eat a
lot<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> bugs<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.950> they<00:02:29.099> don't<00:02:29.280> need<00:02:29.370> as<00:02:29.519> much

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
lot of bugs so they don't need as much

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.809 
lot of bugs so they don't need as much
food<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.310> know<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:32.579> were<00:02:32.640> only

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
eating grain they probably eat about

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.339 
eating grain they probably eat about
four<00:02:34.769> or<00:02:34.829> five<00:02:34.950> ounces<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.549> day<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.230> other

thing is we have no table scraps that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.850 
thing is we have no table scraps that

the<00:02:43.049> green<00:02:43.260> bin<00:02:43.440> program<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.099> eat

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the green bin program they eat

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.699 
the green bin program they eat
everything<00:02:44.989> another<00:02:45.989> common<00:02:46.349> misconception

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
everything another common misconception

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.509 
everything another common misconception
is<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.840> grain<00:02:48.840> fed<00:02:49.319> chickens<00:02:49.769> are<00:02:50.220> better

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
is that grain fed chickens are better

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.610 
is that grain fed chickens are better
but<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> fact<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.569> matter<00:02:51.629> is<00:02:51.930> chickens

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
but the fact of the matter is chickens

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.830 
but the fact of the matter is chickens
are<00:02:52.739> omnivores<00:02:53.340> their<00:02:53.730> meat<00:02:53.970> eaters<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:54.810> I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
are omnivores their meat eaters so I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.319 
are omnivores their meat eaters so I
think<00:02:55.109> for<00:02:55.440> everyone<00:02:56.010> who<00:02:56.250> has<00:02:56.310> backyard<00:02:57.090> hens

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329

miserable life that they have that
that's<00:03:03.239> one<00:03:03.480> better<00:03:03.750> off<00:03:03.959> chicken<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that's one better off chicken and you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.800 
that's one better off chicken and you
know<00:03:05.040> overall<00:03:05.459> you're<00:03:06.030> getting<00:03:06.299> better<00:03:06.450> food
