way<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> would<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.490> possible<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.450> need<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
way that it would be possible you need a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
way that it would be possible you need a
lot<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> time<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.640> need<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.299> about

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lot of time and you need to know about

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.969 
lot of time and you need to know about
trading<00:01:42.990> already<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> need<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
trading already you know you need to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
trading already you know you need to
know<00:01:44.220> how<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> make<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.119> spreadsheets<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
know how to make your spreadsheets you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
know how to make your spreadsheets you
need<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.829> Excel<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.909> all

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
need to know about Excel and then all

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.520 
need to know about Excel and then all
the<00:01:48.299> stuff<00:01:48.540> surrounding<00:01:48.750> trading<00:01:49.380> with

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the stuff surrounding trading with

the<00:01:52.890> trial<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> starting

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the trial you have a bit of starting

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
the trial you have a bit of starting
capital<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.320> start<00:01:55.530> buying<00:01:55.829> and

you try to earn a place on that trial

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220 
you try to earn a place on that trial
account<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.520> would<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.940> true<00:02:30.180> exploration<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
account it would be true exploration and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.620 
account it would be true exploration and
for<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.830> we've<00:02:32.070> got<00:02:32.310> specific<00:02:32.910> ships<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.390> EVE

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
for that we've got specific ships in EVE

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.650 
for that we've got specific ships in EVE
Online<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.730> first<00:02:36.000> part<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
Online and so the first part in the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.510 
Online and so the first part in the
meantime<00:02:36.840> I'll<00:02:37.170> maybe<00:02:37.320> show<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.740> guys<00:02:38.010> what

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
meantime I'll maybe show you guys what

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.310 
meantime I'll maybe show you guys what
you'd<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.850> doing<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.300> exploration<00:02:39.990> most<00:02:40.170> of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
you'd be doing as exploration most of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.780 
you'd be doing as exploration most of
the<00:02:40.410> time<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.310> first<00:02:41.520> part<00:02:41.910> would<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.690> do

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the time the first part would be to do

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.000 
the time the first part would be to do
both<00:02:44.790> sets<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.480> career<00:02:45.840> agents<00:02:46.350> for<00:02:46.500> my<00:02:46.680> race

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
both sets of career agents for my race

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.790 
both sets of career agents for my race
and<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.570> will<00:02:48.780> yield<00:02:49.350> someone

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and I think that will yield someone

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040 
and I think that will yield someone
around<00:02:50.070> 10<00:02:50.370> million<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.910> starting<00:02:51.390> capital<00:02:51.630> if

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
around 10 million in starting capital if

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.140 
around 10 million in starting capital if
you<00:02:52.260> sell<00:02:52.650> all<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.190> extra<00:02:53.550> stuff<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.820> get

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you sell all of the extra stuff you get

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.940 
you sell all of the extra stuff you get
there<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.570> then<00:02:55.050> several<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.709> these

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
there and then several of these

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250 
there and then several of these
exploration<00:02:56.790> ships<00:02:57.030> which<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:57.959> fit

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
exploration ships which you would fit

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.160 
exploration ships which you would fit
very<00:02:58.470> cheaply<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.550> just<00:02:59.970> some<00:03:00.150> probes<00:03:00.510> data

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
very cheaply so just some probes data

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.290 
very cheaply so just some probes data
relic<00:03:01.770> analyzer<00:03:02.190> maybe<00:03:02.670> something<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.180> help

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
relic analyzer maybe something to help

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.570 
relic analyzer maybe something to help
you<00:03:03.480> stand<00:03:03.810> better<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.770> propulsion<00:03:05.190> mod

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
you stand better and a propulsion mod

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.840 
you stand better and a propulsion mod
and<00:03:05.820> then<00:03:06.300> for<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> first<00:03:07.080> 10<00:03:07.740> days<00:03:08.010> maybe<00:03:08.580> 2

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and then for the first 10 days maybe 2

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.470 
and then for the first 10 days maybe 2
weeks<00:03:09.030> even<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:10.410> would<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:11.459> your<00:03:11.760> scanning<00:03:12.209> in

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
weeks even you would do your scanning in

weeks even you would do your scanning in
heizak<00:03:12.959> look<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.410> data<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.920> relic<00:03:14.250> sites<00:03:14.520> and

heizak look for data and relic sites and
in<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.360> meantime<00:03:15.570> focus<00:03:16.410> your<00:03:16.620> skills<00:03:17.040> on

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
in the meantime focus your skills on

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.600 
in the meantime focus your skills on
this<00:03:18.690> tab<00:03:18.930> right<00:03:18.959> here<00:03:19.170> scanning<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.310> want<00:03:20.519> to

be able to probe almost every signature
that<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.820> game<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.840> want<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.110> have

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that is in the game and you want to have

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.680 
that is in the game and you want to have
archaeology<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.130> high<00:03:26.400> as<00:03:26.580> possible<00:03:27.090> because

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
archaeology as high as possible because

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.050 
archaeology as high as possible because
the<00:03:27.989> relic<00:03:28.350> sites<00:03:28.620> are<00:03:28.860> where<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.610> real<00:03:29.760> money

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
the relic sites are where the real money

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.120 
the relic sites are where the real money
will<00:03:30.239> be<00:03:30.450> after<00:03:30.989> you're<00:03:31.320> able<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.739> actually

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
will be after you're able to actually

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.830 
will be after you're able to actually
run<00:03:32.340> them<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> skills<00:03:33.209> which<00:03:33.390> i<00:03:33.510> think

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
run them with the skills which i think

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.770 
run them with the skills which i think
is<00:03:34.050> possible<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> trial<00:03:35.010> account<00:03:35.450> but<00:03:36.450> still

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
is possible on a trial account but still

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.130 
is possible on a trial account but still
it's<00:03:37.380> gonna<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:37.950> very<00:03:38.220> very<00:03:38.400> tight<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.019> is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
it's gonna be very very tight so this is

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.270 
it's gonna be very very tight so this is
what<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.410> would<00:03:40.470> usually<00:03:40.680> do<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.130> know<00:03:41.220> you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
what you would usually do you know you

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.330 
what you would usually do you know you
see<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.580> couple<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.440> signatures<00:03:43.440> over<00:03:43.650> here<00:03:44.130> and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
see a couple of signatures over here and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.840 
see a couple of signatures over here and
you<00:03:44.550> would<00:03:44.930> try<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:45.959> find<00:03:46.140> out<00:03:46.620> what<00:03:47.190> they<00:03:47.610> are

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
you would try to find out what they are

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.509 
you would try to find out what they are
exactly<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.690> let's<00:03:48.870> quickly<00:03:49.140> do<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.250> for

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
exactly so let's quickly do that for

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.420 
exactly so let's quickly do that for
this<00:03:50.640> one<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.150> again<00:03:52.050> with<00:03:52.230> skills<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:53.100> can

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
this one and again with skills you can

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.270 
this one and again with skills you can
improve<00:03:54.330> your<00:03:54.900> ability<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.470> find<00:03:55.860> out<00:03:56.010> what's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
improve your ability to find out what's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.030 
improve your ability to find out what's
behind<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.760> signature<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:58.260> data<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.769> relic

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
behind a signature the data and relic

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.820 
behind a signature the data and relic
sites<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.550> heizak<00:04:00.060> they<00:04:00.450> don't<00:04:00.900> yield<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.590> a

well just to help with your skill

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.480 
well just to help with your skill
training<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.560> goes<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> bit<00:04:26.070> faster

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.590 
training so that that goes a bit faster
and<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.729> can<00:04:26.850> actually

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
and you can actually

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.380 
and you can actually
Finnish<00:04:27.900> archaeology<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.970> decent<00:04:30.330> amount

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
Finnish archaeology in a decent amount

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.960 
Finnish archaeology in a decent amount
of<00:04:30.660> time<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.170> you<00:04:31.320> can<00:04:31.440> do<00:04:31.980> those<00:04:32.520> juicy

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
of time so that you can do those juicy

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.640 
of time so that you can do those juicy
real<00:04:33.180> excite<00:04:33.450> attraction<00:04:34.020> looking<00:04:34.320> for<00:04:34.500> any

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
real excite attraction looking for any

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.800 
real excite attraction looking for any
thermal<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.790> that's<00:04:36.000> perfect<00:04:36.480> because<00:04:36.600> that

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
thermal so that's perfect because that

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.330 
thermal so that's perfect because that
would<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.320> second<00:04:37.650> leg<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:37.950> know<00:04:38.070> once

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
would be the second leg you know once

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.180 
would be the second leg you know once
you're<00:04:38.640> ready<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.540> actually<00:04:40.170> scan<00:04:40.740> those

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
you're ready to actually scan those

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.510 
you're ready to actually scan those

those sites with a relic analyzers

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.040 
those sites with a relic analyzers
you'll<00:04:46.950> want<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.310> head<00:04:47.820> off<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.210> worm<00:04:48.840> old

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
you'll want to head off to worm old

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.900 
you'll want to head off to worm old
space<00:04:49.410> which<00:04:49.680> I'm<00:04:49.890> heading<00:04:50.190> towards<00:04:50.760> that

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.780

worm<00:04:51.120> alright<00:04:51.480> now<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.860> you'll<00:04:53.190> want<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.550> look

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
worm alright now and you'll want to look

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.880 
worm alright now and you'll want to look
for<00:04:53.850> pirate<00:04:54.690> relic<00:04:54.990> sites<00:04:55.230> in<00:04:55.470> there<00:04:55.710> now

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
for pirate relic sites in there now

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.580 
for pirate relic sites in there now
those<00:04:56.190> sites<00:04:56.520> they<00:04:57.270> can<00:04:57.300> be<00:04:57.870> run<00:04:58.080> in<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.380> ship

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
those sites they can be run in a ship

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.620 
those sites they can be run in a ship
like<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.010> there<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.400> no<00:04:59.610> combat<00:05:00.000> involved

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
like this there is no combat involved

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.720 
like this there is no combat involved
unless<00:05:00.900> it's<00:05:01.170> other<00:05:01.350> players<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.010> they<00:05:02.490> can

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
unless it's other players and they can

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.840 
unless it's other players and they can
yield<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.360> 50<00:05:03.930> 60<00:05:04.410> 70<00:05:04.950> million<00:05:05.160> if<00:05:05.430> you're<00:05:05.820> a

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
yield you 50 60 70 million if you're a

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.030 
yield you 50 60 70 million if you're a
little<00:05:06.270> bit<00:05:06.450> lucky<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.500> think<00:05:07.860> that

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
little bit lucky and so I think that

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.690 
little bit lucky and so I think that
this<00:05:08.280> is<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:09.420> pretty<00:05:10.260> much<00:05:10.440> only<00:05:10.740> realistic

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
this is the pretty much only realistic

less<00:06:58.740> than<00:06:59.240> 30<00:07:00.240> or<00:07:00.449> 40<00:07:00.810> hours<00:07:01.169> a<00:07:01.500> week<00:07:01.760> so<00:07:02.760> yeah

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
less than 30 or 40 hours a week so yeah

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.060 
less than 30 or 40 hours a week so yeah
opportunity<00:07:03.870> costs<00:07:04.290> and<00:07:04.440> the<00:07:04.770> fact<00:07:05.010> that

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
opportunity costs and the fact that

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.070 
opportunity costs and the fact that
you'll<00:07:05.280> burn<00:07:05.610> yourself<00:07:05.760> out<00:07:06.300> trying<00:07:06.660> to<00:07:06.930> earn

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
you'll burn yourself out trying to earn

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.610 
you'll burn yourself out trying to earn
a<00:07:07.110> Plex

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
a Plex

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.310 
a Plex
on<00:07:07.740> your<00:07:08.280> first<00:07:08.580> 30<00:07:08.820> days<00:07:09.000> are<00:07:09.449> really<00:07:09.840> the

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
on your first 30 days are really the

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.010 
on your first 30 days are really the
main<00:07:10.500> reason<00:07:10.530> why<00:07:11.220> I<00:07:11.250> would<00:07:11.729> say<00:07:11.970> don't<00:07:12.720> try

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
main reason why I would say don't try

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.960 
main reason why I would say don't try
this<00:07:13.080> but<00:07:13.440> if<00:07:13.590> you<00:07:13.740> want<00:07:13.950> to<00:07:14.070> do<00:07:14.160> it<00:07:14.280> if<00:07:14.430> I<00:07:14.610> had

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
this but if you want to do it if I had

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.150 
this but if you want to do it if I had
to<00:07:15.120> do<00:07:15.240> it<00:07:15.389> it<00:07:15.900> would<00:07:16.169> be<00:07:16.200> the<00:07:16.470> exploration

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
to do it it would be the exploration

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.520 
to do it it would be the exploration
route<00:07:17.370> and<00:07:17.669> what<00:07:18.600> would<00:07:18.810> I<00:07:18.900> do<00:07:18.960> instead<00:07:19.350> I

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
route and what would I do instead I

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.010 
route and what would I do instead I
would<00:07:19.950> use<00:07:20.310> the<00:07:20.490> trial<00:07:20.790> to<00:07:21.450> try<00:07:21.690> a<00:07:21.720> bit<00:07:21.960> of

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
would use the trial to try a bit of

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.710 
would use the trial to try a bit of
everything<00:07:22.310> try<00:07:23.310> to<00:07:23.370> find<00:07:23.669> out<00:07:23.820> what<00:07:24.150> I<00:07:24.180> enjoy

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
everything try to find out what I enjoy

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.820 
everything try to find out what I enjoy
and<00:07:24.990> try<00:07:25.680> to<00:07:25.740> find<00:07:26.100> a<00:07:26.280> corporation<00:07:27.000> that<00:07:27.330> also

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
and try to find a corporation that also

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.219 
and try to find a corporation that also
does<00:07:28.830> the<00:07:28.979> stuff<00:07:29.220> that<00:07:29.400> I<00:07:29.430> enjoy<00:07:29.940> then<00:07:30.630> after

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
does the stuff that I enjoy then after

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.469 
does the stuff that I enjoy then after
that<00:07:31.410> I<00:07:31.710> would<00:07:31.950> pay<00:07:32.340> for<00:07:32.400> my<00:07:32.639> subscription<00:07:33.330> and

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 
that I would pay for my subscription and

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.690 
that I would pay for my subscription and
then<00:07:33.810> I<00:07:34.020> would<00:07:34.200> slowly<00:07:34.500> set<00:07:34.800> my<00:07:34.950> goal<00:07:35.190> of<00:07:35.340> let's

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700 
then I would slowly set my goal of let's

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.610 
then I would slowly set my goal of let's
see<00:07:35.910> how<00:07:36.120> long<00:07:36.360> it<00:07:36.570> actually<00:07:36.600> takes<00:07:37.110> me<00:07:37.380> to

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
see how long it actually takes me to

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.740 
see how long it actually takes me to
earn<00:07:37.800> that<00:07:37.830> for<00:07:38.280> first<00:07:38.639> place<00:07:38.940> and<00:07:39.389> I<00:07:39.510> think

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
earn that for first place and I think

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.779

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:41.789 
you'll be really surprised at how fast

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.240 
you'll be really surprised at how fast
you'll<00:07:42.030> be<00:07:42.180> paying<00:07:42.479> only<00:07:43.289> half<00:07:43.620> price<00:07:43.919> for<00:07:43.949> the

you'll be paying only half price for the
game<00:07:44.430> because<00:07:44.729> at<00:07:45.330> some<00:07:45.600> point<00:07:45.840> you'll<00:07:45.990> easily
