00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello tourist is now in full swing 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.759
 season 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 so today we will make a tool 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.230
 which will help us overcome the spring and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.220
 more often cut meat and fish what is it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.430
 small urine 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 we will need a billet suitable for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.570
 hardness of steel in our case 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.960
 billet 3mm stainless 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.950
 for a start we will define the form of life 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.079
 did not stop on this form 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.289
 perfect main manufacture progress 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 First we put the blade shape on our 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.539
 preparation 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.570
 after marking the workpiece with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.570
 Bulgarians give the initial entrance 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.170
 the main thing that the main thing is to comply or 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.280
 to 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.400
 further on the emery machine and 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.930
 grinding machine 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.930
 finally we do here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.270
 now a failed match 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.409
 So 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.569
 here we are 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.060
 I led to the final refinement with 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:08.280
 using a belt grinder 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 life wedge shaped 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.960
 google google 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.290
 and degrees and using a drill . sickly 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.290
 tasks 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.510
 reducing the graininess of the circle we achieve 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.090
 understand and roughness checking 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.569
 then comes the turn of felted cinema 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.890
 ritmo mean 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.850
 achieve the maximum 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 to cut 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.959
 so here we came out a small knife night 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.280
 yes you can say that there is no pen 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.900
 but i want you 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.160
 will show in the next video how 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.390
 can we make a paracord handle we 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.640
 sharpened less often 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:53.220
 the newspaper is fine so thank you all for 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.550
 attention everyone liked the video put 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.550
