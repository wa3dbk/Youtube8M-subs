think balance is very important to be

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.260 
think balance is very important to be
able<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.830> balance<00:02:27.250> your<00:02:27.550> whole<00:02:27.670> body<00:02:27.910> and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
able to balance your whole body and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.470 
able to balance your whole body and
speed<00:02:29.140> over<00:02:29.440> 10<00:02:30.160> or<00:02:30.340> 15<00:02:30.670> yards<00:02:30.850> that's<00:02:31.240> very

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
speed over 10 or 15 yards that's very

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.530 
speed over 10 or 15 yards that's very
important<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:31.990> see<00:02:32.320> how<00:02:32.680> about<00:02:32.860> dribbling<00:02:33.540> well

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
that's something that's difficult to

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.310 
that's something that's difficult to
