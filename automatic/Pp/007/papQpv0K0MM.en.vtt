00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hi, video, let's upgrade today. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.250
 in this little boat is the boat of otava 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.929
 by little pop barrel 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.929
 soon after more vignette 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.259
 you upgrade it will need 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 only a box of juice or milk 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.230
 Then you pick up the milk carton and cut it with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 south cuts in half of it there and then with 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 the other half that cuts only one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.650
 piece make the booth and put more 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
 or less so to make the cabin of the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.300
 neighborhood with this part and now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
 To make a square to be able to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 put a motor as if it were a motor 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.739
 and then the square will be 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.079
 so it's only you fit this part is the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.570
 that makes the boat ride the engine giving 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.609
 so you fill with hot glue to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.230
 see to it that water does not get inside 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.969
 from the park 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.000
 after all it will get collado 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.509
 so I've pasted this part there is 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.800
 grudei comfort engine around here this 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.369
 part has to stay underneath every 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.190
 water is prohibited and this part is for 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.070
 you put the novel is to see if 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.160
 puts candle and lights to happen 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.160
 put water inside the engine 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.849
 he could heat the water and make the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.849
 little boat walks 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.480
