00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.830 
techniques like one-way and two-way
pickslanting<00:01:29.670> actually<00:01:30.670> work<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.119> because

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
pickslanting actually work and because

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.580 
pickslanting actually work and because
it's<00:01:32.020> live<00:01:32.259> we<00:01:32.770> can<00:01:32.920> stop<00:01:33.220> at<00:01:33.400> any<00:01:33.579> point

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.399 

to<00:01:38.039> review<00:01:38.429> tricky<00:01:38.909> sequences<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.869> offer

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to review tricky sequences and offer

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.679 
to review tricky sequences and offer
even<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.890> real-world<00:01:41.399> examples<00:01:42.240> than<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.570> do

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
even more real-world examples than we do

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.779 
even more real-world examples than we do
in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.929> episodes<00:01:43.350> will<00:01:44.039> also<00:01:44.340> train<00:01:44.609> our

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
in the episodes will also train our

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.880 
in the episodes will also train our
magnifying<00:01:45.329> glasses<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> code<00:01:46.350> archive

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
magnifying glasses on the code archive

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.919 
magnifying glasses on the code archive
and<00:01:47.219> of<00:01:47.579> course<00:01:47.789> you'll<00:01:48.270> bring<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.569> guitars

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
and of course you'll bring your guitars

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.580 
and of course you'll bring your guitars
so<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.679> workshop<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:50.369> techniques<00:01:50.880> live

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
so we can workshop these techniques live

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.139 
so we can workshop these techniques live
now<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> key<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.189> me<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
now the key here for me is the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
now the key here for me is the
interaction<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.959> talking<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.679> code<00:01:55.890> viewer

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
interaction in talking the code viewer

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
interaction in talking the code viewer
questions<00:01:57.090> inspired<00:01:57.659> viewer<00:01:58.200> follow-up

questions inspired viewer follow-up

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
questions inspired viewer follow-up
questions<00:01:59.250> which<00:01:59.729> ended<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.090> taking<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
questions which ended up taking the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
questions which ended up taking the
discussion<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.020> whole<00:02:01.259> new<00:02:01.439> directions

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.740 
discussion in whole new directions
now<00:02:02.459> I<00:02:02.490> ended<00:02:02.789> up<00:02:02.880> playing<00:02:03.119> things<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.479> hadn't

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
now I ended up playing things I hadn't

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.569 
now I ended up playing things I hadn't
prepared<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.319> but<00:02:04.829> that's<00:02:05.009> cool<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.219> helps

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
prepared for but that's cool that helps

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.969 
prepared for but that's cool that helps
get<00:02:05.759> me<00:02:05.909> thinking<00:02:06.569> and<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.079> fact<00:02:07.289> as<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> result

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
get me thinking and in fact as a result

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.740 
get me thinking and in fact as a result
of<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.280> we've<00:02:08.729> already<00:02:09.000> made<00:02:09.269> changes<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
