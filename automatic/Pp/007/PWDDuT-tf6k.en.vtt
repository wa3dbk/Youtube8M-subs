00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
you differently than other people which

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.600 
you differently than other people which
is<00:02:09.170> obvious<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:09.800> think<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.160> lot<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.399> people

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
is obvious so I think a lot of people

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.340 
is obvious so I think a lot of people
forget<00:02:10.760> about<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.420> that's<00:02:11.750> why<00:02:11.960> I<00:02:11.990> always

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
forget about it and that's why I always

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.320 
forget about it and that's why I always
say<00:02:12.500> that's<00:02:12.980> number<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.820> understand

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
say that's number one to understand

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330 
say that's number one to understand
because<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.170> need<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.500> find<00:02:15.800> what<00:02:16.010> works<00:02:16.160> for

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
because you need to find what works for
