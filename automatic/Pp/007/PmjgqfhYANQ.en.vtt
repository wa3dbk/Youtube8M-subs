 hello everybody talking here about windows 8.1 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 the geo tv channel on youtube in this video 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.340
 Here's another novelty. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.289
 interesting and useful in windows 8.1 that is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.920
 initialization in the area of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.680
 classical work, ie this area of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.260
 I work here before on windows 8 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 we had an alternative to do 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.140
 with which initialization here in the area of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
 classical work 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 Only now we have an option. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.410
 just mark an option it already initializes 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 right in this area of ​​work here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 many people want as we 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 we do this by right clicking 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.760
 here on my desktop and I'm going 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 navigation despite my version here 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.530
 it's in Portuguese as is the preview version 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 so it still has some adjustments and also 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 with luck then must do in 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.049
 some cases there we'll see it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 words in English still then is this 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.950

 Navigation, you see, I'm going to click on it. 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.409

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.409
