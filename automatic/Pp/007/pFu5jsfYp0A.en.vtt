00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
loose but it's okay the figure will

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.940 
loose but it's okay the figure will
still<00:03:53.459> stand<00:03:53.760> as<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.930> say<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.739> falls

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
still stand as I say that and it falls

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.789 
still stand as I say that and it falls
right<00:03:56.250> will<00:03:56.940> stand<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.540> long<00:03:58.110> as<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.410> balance

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
right will stand so long as you balance

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.039 
right will stand so long as you balance
it<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.519> it<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.269> pretty<00:04:00.540> stable

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
it but it is pretty stable

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.170 
it but it is pretty stable
you<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.920> got<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.100> take<00:04:02.310> into<00:04:02.519> account<00:04:02.610> all

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you just got to take into account all

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.750

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
not much area here for standing but it

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.750 
not much area here for standing but it
does<00:04:09.780> seem<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.799> for<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.070> most<00:04:11.220> part<00:04:11.370> stay
