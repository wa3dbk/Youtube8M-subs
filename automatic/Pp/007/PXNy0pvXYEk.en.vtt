00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.120
 DIY brick repair 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.559
 stoveheating House Cottage 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 how is it all repaired early or 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.100
 late we try such a problem that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 pussy should be repaired to touch 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.080
 now just what is the problem 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.630
 is the firebox that is win 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 bricks especially when you heat coal 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:37.829
 it is still quite often it happens 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:42.329
 cell that is a couple of years and here we go 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.640
 materials as it is now 30 problem not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.579
 punch slots somehow had to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.780
 encounter and for myself discovered 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.600
 some set that already exists 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.600
 appeared so to speak shops in this 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.750
 a lot of material already appears 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:11.970
 gradually a new technology so to speak 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.909
 Of course the problem of a match is always hers. 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.390
 facing 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.640
 I, in my lifetime, only cool myself 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.920
 did you see qatar when faced 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.360
 the stove wolves and metal sides of the wall 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.659
 metal is used best of course 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.320
 but it's all great stainless steel not herself 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530
 thin 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.930
 or aluminum is also not very thin 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.399
 metals that is already a brick there inside 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.399
 Already no appearance as it allows 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.990
 enjoy this piece 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 art tiles over very 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.460
 costly dollar or everywhere 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.460
 can it all apply 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.909
 how would I come across this too 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.730
 I had to do it once 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:15.180
 show faced such a stove saw 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.090
 it became scary of course builders such 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.830
 left it had to somehow all 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.200
 naturalize channel and there is not 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.090
 understand whether to sing something to me have become 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.870
 roughly sony here have done this 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.870
 incomprehensibility 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.200
 no matter how important it is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.340
 with the wall just figured out as if 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.739
 plasterboard already have refractory like 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.830
 Profile all throws all elementary 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:53.510
 then rushes proof it all 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.510
 screwed ips card everything is simple 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.739
 tile tiles also already have heat resistant 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.200
 optional and immediately sold and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.410
 heat st as there is frost so much so if 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.760
 heat as well as the adhesive itself is the same 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.459
 there is for us on here where warm floors are there 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 everything is like me, too, can be different too 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:25.110
 use use the whole thing 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.299
 naturally facing 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.299
 In this case, you will be a little longer 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.640
 serve but she the stove of course here 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:40.590
 same thing 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.560
 heat resistant tiles already have glue 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.299
 special for 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.100
 they are used for masonry work 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.850
 same for tile work 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.850
 also heat resistant sealant and sealants 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.239
 it's all generally much torus as it were 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.640
 in the area cheap product well some 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:07.320
 time is natural that this is all you have 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.430
 will serve as a little bit to please 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.680
 you 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.260
 then this all work is not finished then 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.859
 I'll show you all this later how it will be 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.269
 finish 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:20.789
 if we live the same way if you helped 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.190
 ask stores use 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.610
