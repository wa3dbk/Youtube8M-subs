00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
starting with the left side you're going

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.550 
starting with the left side you're going
to<00:03:25.440> get<00:03:25.970> two<00:03:26.970> strands<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.840> contrasting

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.860 
to get two strands of the contrasting
color<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.330> we're<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.480> start<00:03:30.690> with<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
color and we're going to start with the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.340 
color and we're going to start with the
left<00:03:31.140> side<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.739> pull<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.940> loop<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.480> we're

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
left side and pull up a loop and we're

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.600 
left side and pull up a loop and we're
going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.530> work<00:03:34.769> with<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.250> side<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.299> um<00:03:37.610> it's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
going to work with that side so um it's

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.640 
going to work with that side so um it's
best<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.180> start<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> left<00:03:39.900> side<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.500> way

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
best to start on the left side the way

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.550 
best to start on the left side the way
that<00:03:40.859> you<00:03:41.010> work<00:03:41.220> around

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.020 

the<00:03:44.099> boot<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.459> because<00:03:45.110> when<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.140> say<00:03:46.440> left<00:03:46.680> side

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
the boot is because when I say left side

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.290 
the boot is because when I say left side
like<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.720> back<00:03:48.930> part<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.730> boot<00:03:50.730> facing

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
like the back part of the boot facing

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.110 
like the back part of the boot facing
you<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:52.230> would<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.800> left<00:03:53.040> side<00:03:53.280> so

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
you and this would be the left side so

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.140 
you and this would be the left side so
we're<00:03:54.390> going<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:55.040> pull<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.370> loop<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.790> start

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
we're going to pull up a loop and start

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.030 
we're going to pull up a loop and start
