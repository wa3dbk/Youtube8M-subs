00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.639
 Pauli is again Christian from update 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.740
 and that is a comparison between now 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.599
 i have the samsung galaxy s 6 here 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.749
 in my left hand and the samsung 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.090
 galaxy s 5 the galaxy s 6 that became 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.190
 yesterday at the first sight in 2015 in 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.630
 barcelona unveiled the galaxy s 5 has 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.250
 Accordingly , already a year 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.930
 the hump and I'm going in this one 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.910
 video on the differences between the two devices 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.100
 and tell me my opinion 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.310
 Maybe there is a change 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.419
 upgrade to the galaxy s 6 is worthwhile on the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.489
 So we have the right side 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.010
 predecessor the samsung galaxy s 5 with 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.749
 a 5 1 inch displays super amoled 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.519
 of course, accordingly thick 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.409
 black levels and super saturation 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.449
 and color contrasts and on the left 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.789
 page we also have a 5 1 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.469
 inch display super amoled technology 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.929
 of course with a different one 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.339
 resolution of galaxy s 5 so here now 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.999
 in the foreground has a full hd 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.609
 Resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.639
 this device has the galaxy s 6 has one 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.309
 resolution in the quad hd that is 2560 x 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.500
 1440 pixels is accordingly around 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.000
 some book dissolving and 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.560
 accordingly, the green is too 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.810
 sharpness the angles are better and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.820
 Overall, they are much better 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.009
 from it you can see the edges around 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 this display in wesel the narrower 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.090
 become opposite the galaxy s 5 and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.399
 Just look at the size 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.340
 maybe the galaxy s 6 is one 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.049
 half a millimeter bigger ticker longer 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.530
 Be that as it may be called 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.780
 samsung actually has one 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.619
 another built-in display 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.570
 or 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.729
 The housing is almost the same but 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.439
 Overall, it will look a bit narrower 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.719
 So you have the feeling that that 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.820
 galaxy s 6 just better in the 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.689
 Incidentally, if you buy the hand, that is 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.950
 want to scotch down into the 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.780
 description because I have a link from 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.420
 11 deposited also we have of course 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.820
 also the grand prix galaxy s 6 im 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.979
 offer to otherwise we have naturally in 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.270
 upper area a right into the layout that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.950
 means we have one 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.719
 button on the right side in 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.729
 Samsung Galaxy S 5 on the left 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.229
 of course also with fingerprint scanner 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.640
 however, they work here 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.560
 different that is that would be 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.000
 galaxy s 5 here i have to finger 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.679
 repeatedly pull over the scanner and 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.690
 to unlock the device when 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.340
 Samsung Galaxy S 6 is the fingerprint 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.780
 scanner got a bit bigger 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 that means that i just when i am 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.430
 keep your finger on care and then unlocked 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.110
 otherwise the device will come 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 to talk briefly to the back 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.950
 There we have a 16 megapixel camera 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.269
 in both models that is synonymous 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.519
 something out as you can see 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.920
 However, the camera samsung 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.720
 galaxy s 6 and also at the samsung galaxy 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.519
 s 6 as with an optical 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.769
 image stabilizer equipped that is 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.049
 The pictures are shake-free videos 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.220
 and smooth and also pictures in the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.590
 lower lip bad lighting conditions 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.420
 are much better at the has 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.400
 the layout of the heart rate monitor it around 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.750
 the led lightning is something of a gander that is 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.880
 no longer under the camera but 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.670
 Now have the camera on time 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.560
 we samsung logo and also the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.000
 loudspeaker anyway at galaxy s 5 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.610
 he is now at samsung 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 galaxy s 6 in the lower area that is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.209
 in the foot of the device what you naturally 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.920
 Immediately pulling is here too 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.239
 use of other materials that 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.030
 Samsung samsung sets the samsung galaxy 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.560
 s 6 on glass and metal that is 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.910
 gorilla glass on the back gorilla 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 Glass on the front 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.450
 during the samsung galaxy s 5 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.489
 actually made of plastic that is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.019
 we have a removable website 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.900
 where we insert a micro sd card 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.850
 can insert the SIM card 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.260
 can and also the battery 1000 can all 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.569
 this is no longer possible with the samsung galaxy 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.870
 s 6 that is we have a tight here 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.760
 Built-in battery from 2550 04 hours 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.859
 accordingly, it is a bit smaller 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.260
 because the samsung galaxy s 5 had that 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.359
 still 2800 milliamps, however 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.579
 you have to say that the new ob day 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.410
 was used here is 35 percent 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.510
 Energy is economical and accordingly 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 this flaw thus this difference of 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.530
 Lid are as 250 million few hours 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.730
 so loose balance and 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.790
 Accordingly, should also with the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.040
 samsung galaxy s 6 easy one and a half 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.230
 days 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.909
 just come through life otherwise can 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.159
 the technical data the samsung galaxy 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.319
 s 5 that started with one 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.629
 16 gigabyte variant since the memory 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.700
 expandable was the samsung galaxy s 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.530
 Sixth only starts at 32 gigabytes 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.629
 also has a faster memory that 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.370
 Whole is called os 2.0 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.620
 accordingly, the access times 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.690
 from on camera on the image stock 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.660
 files and also on games altogether 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.000
 much faster and accordingly 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.860
 Of course , the galaxy s 6 is something 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.630
 brisk on the go whether that is the customer in the 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.310
 everyday life notes that once put there 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.349
 we have a victim core processor here 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.380
 that means eight cores at samsung galaxy 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.880
 Just give us a quadcore and also 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.340
 the RAM is now here on 3 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.410
 gb of conversations is more frequent 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.320
 ddr4 while here in samsung galaxy 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.389
 s fans only 2 gb ram so on the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.039
 the first impression is really almost 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.349
 barely perceptible, however, you have to 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.150
 also say that the pockets are flat or 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.970
 something was purified on the 4th of July and now 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.620
 If I call that you call each one 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.039
 something faster and agree comes up 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.050
 other animation to use the 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.090
 surplus on the samsung galaxy s 5 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.710
 otherwise software must say 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.720
 that they are both equal, that is 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.229
 We both like the samsung galaxy 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.110
 s 5 as well as the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.090
 android 5.0 europe installs that is 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.070
 currently the latest android 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.470
 integration and accordingly 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.490
 really kind to date with a weight 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.900
 of 138 grams here at samsung galaxy s 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.830
 6 you have to say that the combination 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.659
 made of metal gorilla glass and in the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.190
 Processing is absolutely finished and that 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.050
 The device really great in the hand 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.060
 I personally would like it though 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.930
 probably more for the galaxy s 6 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.510
 to decide 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.639
 that's just those actors with display edge 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.710
 had really really looks good and 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.930
 in my opinion really very good in 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.850
 the hand lies 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.110
 yes i hope i could give you something like that 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.210
 clarify where the differences lie 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.910
 between the samsung galaxy s 6 and the 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.160
 samsung galaxy s 5 so from the previous year 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.050
 Generally one has to say one absolutely 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.090
 not just evolution but a small one 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.970
 revolution in samsung goes first of all 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.620
 plastic way blocked materials 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.820
 glass and aluminum also 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.990
 are in accordance with the much much 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.880
 high quality and also at the 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.979
 technical internal so at one 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.139
 hardware components salt camera dem 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.400
 RAM or the cdu has 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.530
 samsung here really the window 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.050
 In addition, it is possible that 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.759
 galaxy s 6 and also the galaxy s 6 as 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.990
 to charge wirelessly 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.610
 that was a very short one 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.560
 Comparison between both devices so 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.120
 the samsung galaxy s 5 from the last one 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.430
 year and the current flagship so 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.720
 the new device is the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.770
 I thank you that you was going to 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.770
 soon it will be good
