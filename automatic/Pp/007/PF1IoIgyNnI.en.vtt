00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.280
 inspired by other books and the letter is 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.140
 quite medium plus the best of this

 edition is that I have it autographed by 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.039

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.960
 the one that I leave here but good of 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.510
 what is the story about this book 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.570
 Sebastian is a child who was orphaned 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.519
 the 12 - year work recalls the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.399
 face of his parents in pain continues 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.449
 being very present in your heart 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.909
 fortunately, he is not alone 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.219
 uncle paco the god baco is a person 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.979
 incredible the truth the time that you 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.530
 even by the elbows a lot you know 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.910
 a thousand memory poems all the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.039
 time is reciting poems from 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.200
 different authors also believes quite 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.030
 in the power of the word there is a part 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.679
 of the dress for ccoo says that people 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 he is more afraid of words than of 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.810
 cannons and it's true and also uncle paco 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.750
 He spends most of his time in 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.970
 take care of sebastián her nephew so that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.250
 Definitely uncle paco ni sebastián 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.039
 they are normal people but good 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.750
 let's be honest who would want to be this 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.420
 book to start is 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.220
 full of bibliographies has a lot 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 of books that you can consult while 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.360
 you are reading like this is that if you are a 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.390
 very curious person this book is going to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.640
 fascinate there are quotes from neruda elena 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.920
 poniatowska gabriel garcía marquez 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 william shakespeare the way in which 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.330
 is written is like built with 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.040
 short sentences separated by periods and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.470
 followed is a bit the style that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.660
 used ernest hemingway that are things 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.490
 very short because good a class and 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.070
 I set the average human brain 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.860
 with an average coefficient does not capture more than 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.479
 20 words per sentence then have 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 you like to write I recommend you 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 Write in sentences 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.780
 briefs separated by points is how 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 does benito taibo also you go 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.650
 seeing the evolution of each of the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.989
 characters of sebastián and paco vas 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.959
 growing with them more by learning with 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.370
 them and it's something that I find extremely 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.830
 enriching something else very father of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.410
 book is that it makes you remember the value 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.900
 what does the person in the world have 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.910
 important that we are like people like 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.330
 human beings done I remembered a tweet 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 that I put in quite some time ago and that if 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.000
 I have it I leave it out 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.530
 and the truth is that evidence has been 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.750
 reviewed not because there are already many 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 it truly is wonderful 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.340
 When I finished reading it, I was missing a 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.569
 couple of lagrimillas by use post I know 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.819
 I'm very crying and I cry with 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.010
 everything but is that I really take 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.709
 quite this book really is what 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.659
 I highly recommend not let it pass 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.540
 but good throughout this video 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.129
 I hid a sentence from this book to see if 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.819
 they find you if they find you put on 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.980
 comments and also and I do not know if 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.870
 they want me to make them a top 5 of my 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.310
 favorite phrases because how can you 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.440
 give a lot of sentences to mars 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.510
 there is a lot of poise in this book 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.849
 then there are a lot of phrases that I 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.260
 they like and if you want to share them 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.150
 with you also put in the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.159
 comments is good until the video 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.109
 today remember that the review of this 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.019
 book is also on the blog with other 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.209
 different things and do not forget in the box 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.400
 of descriptions I leave all that those 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 beautiful places where you can follow 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.209
 God God God 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.750
