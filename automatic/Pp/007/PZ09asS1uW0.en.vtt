00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.410
 hi to all of you guys and well back 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.680
 with this new test I am here today 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.869
 to present the bergman gtv 430 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.080
 practically a wagon collect grain and 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.720
 less so is we say better in the menu than 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.570
 farming at the store are essentially i 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.290
 dear ones who serve to stay below we say 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.410
 to the three ways with the tractor and then go to 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.600
 bring seas on a bigger trailer 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.129
 let's say the great without making run on 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.260
 typical rumor field environment that 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.670
 would go to implant because maybe 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.030
 brought by a truck or something like these 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.879
 very large fields are used 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.339
 in my part I have not seen or sidio 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.799
 faces are tiny maris un campetti 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.860
 small that marie dear great effort to 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.200
 turn around and here they bring this here 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.650
 that then the trevi and not make you 100 thousand 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.700
 go and download and list below 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.609
 the threshing, however, I have to say works 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.369
 very well and also done well to wonder 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.439
 termeno also seen from the photos of 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.960
 monster takes some time because 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.710
 he used it a little bit rump towards 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.439
 if you see just mini mini a little bit 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.619
 on the wheels 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:40.189
 I cultivate, however, everything will come 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.490
 wagon let's give the possibility to unhook 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.409
 the pd oe we sit and tells us that the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 beat to allow in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.590
 the barrel in operation we look for barrel 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.960
 but to write at least wagon this is it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.149
 a little error to fix 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.159
 then I don't know why it's always the tractor that 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.810
 does a little up and down when attacked the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.780
 wagon but let's leave it so you have 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.869
 possibility with the right button of the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.819
 mouse to adjust a little there maybe a 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.620
 inclination of the wagon or in any case the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.299
 worse on skis or worse on 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.900
 tractor a tractor in front bale 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.450
 always in any case it is a bit like tea 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.940
 ravitex that you can adjust inclination 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.470
 but based on the weights whatever else there is 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.590
 some experts want to give some 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.450
 clarification for the fact why it comes 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.709
 used this thing in reality write 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.989
 well then we have with the key 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.370
 possibility to open close let's say 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.640
 the exhaust pipe for which you see 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.459
 however you copy the inside and that 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.349
 left mouse button possibility of 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:59.450
 go to adjust the inclination here of 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:02.540
 Jet basically live there are 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.569
 others we have the n for 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.409
 let's say cover I must say that too 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.079
 beautiful 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.450
 pity that they could ever do it at least 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:16.430
 that you pull a little up and down instead of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:20.030
 appears or more so very fast or 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 the b key then we have the light of the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.239
 discharge if you're at night definitely 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.829
 it may be of interest to you and with blocked lines 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.260
 practically ticket assistance and yes 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.090
 all right and wrong are put 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.720
 download 9 usual good things we give 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.600
 below we see 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.910
 discharge 41 thousand liters capacity here 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.910
 some starts downloading 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.890
 you also have the window lucchettino 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.880
 to see more or less the cart counts 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.960
 example they put two you can 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.000
 see for sure that if you have low level 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:10.709
 here in front the tall window 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.110
 back does not make download noises or 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.200
 other type 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.959
 silence there are no animations here 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.860
 inside, however, the cochlea was bad 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.050
 straight that pushed pushed things 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.640
 towards the outside instead we see that 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.520
 let's say a little like that 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.520
 on the sides and away 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.630
 which for the downloads of what 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.790
 in short, it works and carros a cart 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.400
 simple, however, I saw a beautiful war 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:47.479
 cart said but let's present it 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.789
 a good capacity of a good does not have a 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:55.009
 exaggerated weight and less I could see 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:57.860
 leave quite well even with zeus 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:03.889
 4 that doesn't have who knows how many horses 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.840
 so I must say that it is also good to have 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.529
 guys short presentation this not 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.749
 there is more to say functional works e 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.769
 after here see all the sound sticks out 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:17.499
 outwards 

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:20.799
 beat first edge is yours nothing 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:25.519
 arrows work in reverse too 

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:28.039
 also brakes therefore we are opposed to have 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:30.129
 commented guys sign up left 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.559
 nice like 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.559
 Hello everyone, bye bye bye next time
