00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
that's just more storage otherwise it's

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.750 
that's just more storage otherwise it's

he's showing 13,600 miles but I should

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.389 
he's showing 13,600 miles but I should
think<00:05:31.139> it's<00:05:31.439> a<00:05:31.529> hundred<00:05:31.889> and<00:05:32.009> thirteen

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:32.399 
think it's a hundred and thirteen

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.479
