 I 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.450
 personal note 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.149
 we are at war pontresina 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.710
 this is where the catenary stops 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.810
 single phase of the Rhaetian Railways 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.350
 and that they start it's the court in 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.240
 continuous line of the bernina collar 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.069
 bernina reread the centuries 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.289
 the engadine to the poschiavo valley 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.630
 at the beginning it is not only a path 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.459
 mule the village to counter zina 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.560
 strategically placed at the foot of the pass 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.119
 did not really matter 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.119
 that with the opening of the railway 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.300
 at 2253 meters altitude war 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.120
 of hospice yoga nina is the highest of 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.840
 network of Rhaetian railways 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.760
 unfortunately on the location is 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:06.710
 very exposed and snow drifts 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:08.600
 accumulate on height standards for 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:15.350
 continue on poschiavo the bow is 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.780
 no longer needed this rotary snow plow 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.850
 built by slm de winter 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.450
 tower can move by its own 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.710
 means thanks to its steam mechanism 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.900
 to fit in the tight curves 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.090
 from the line of the bernina he climbed 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.420
 on two trains of 3 powered axles 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.680
 by two cylinders noÃ© the coal are 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.010
 in addition in a time of air to two 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.010
 axles 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.969
 it's actually a real 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:48.819
 articulated locomotive equipped with a 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.950
 turbine snow flush this machine has 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.599
 immediately given satisfaction and the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.639
 st moritz section at the hospice you 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.750
 Bernina could be exploited as early as winter 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.579
 1911 1912 a second unit was then 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.540
 ordered to allow the opening of 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.540
 the whole modern line 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.650
 accompany make a team 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.660
 hopper up at the back between the 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.550
 boiler and the tandem while the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.550
 front wheel drive mechanic 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.330
 the craft is normally pushed by a 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.790
 self-propelled to keep all its 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.560
 power for snow removal 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.420
 if the catenary and off it's 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 pushed in diesel traction by one of 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.560
 two dual-mode locomotives
