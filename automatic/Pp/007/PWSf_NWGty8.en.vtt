00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
all right what's a today's date remove

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.619 
all right what's a today's date remove
the<00:00:02.970> today's<00:00:03.510> date<00:00:03.750> 18th<00:00:04.740> October<00:00:05.279> 2013<00:00:05.970> just

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the today's date 18th October 2013 just

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.780 
the today's date 18th October 2013 just
in<00:00:06.810> case<00:00:07.020> our<00:00:07.200> demonstration<00:00:08.189> goes<00:00:08.400> horribly

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
in case our demonstration goes horribly

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.160 
in case our demonstration goes horribly
wrong<00:00:08.910> yeah<00:00:09.809> okay<00:00:11.389> it<00:00:12.389> turn<00:00:12.599> turn<00:00:12.900> off<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
wrong yeah okay it turn turn off the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.650 
wrong yeah okay it turn turn off the
power<00:00:13.290> supply<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.599> I'll<00:00:16.410> restart<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
power supply and I'll restart the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.250 
power supply and I'll restart the
demonstration<00:00:18.660> three<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:20.070> one

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
demonstration three two one

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.890 
demonstration three two one
right<00:00:22.260> stop<00:00:24.710> okay<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.890> start<00:00:26.900> talking

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
right stop okay this start talking

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.150 
right stop okay this start talking
calibration<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.060> see<00:00:31.009> that's<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
calibration as you can see that's a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.580 
calibration as you can see that's a
twenty<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.579> millimeter<00:00:32.790> struggler<00:00:33.590> yeah

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
twenty two millimeter struggler yeah

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
twenty two millimeter struggler yeah
which<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> parameter<00:00:36.050> now<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.260> show

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
which is the parameter now let's show

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.959 
which is the parameter now let's show
you<00:00:37.500> error<00:00:37.739> detection<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.670> an<00:00:38.820> error

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
you error detection so that's an error

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
you error detection so that's an error
right<00:00:40.879> that's<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:42.030> error<00:00:42.210> yeah

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
right that's an error yeah

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
right that's an error yeah
and<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.710> signified<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> little<00:00:45.239> red

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and that's signified by the little red

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.690 
and that's signified by the little red
LED<00:00:45.539> yeah<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.280> error<00:00:47.430> occurs<00:00:48.320> our

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
LED yeah so when an error occurs our

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.270 
LED yeah so when an error occurs our
system<00:00:50.700> tries<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> fix<00:00:52.079> itself<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.980> just

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
system tries to fix itself as you just

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.639 
system tries to fix itself as you just
saw<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> brings<00:00:54.600> itself<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.320> exactly

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
saw and it brings itself back to exactly

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
saw and it brings itself back to exactly
twenty<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.219> millimeters<00:00:56.699> now<00:00:59.570> we<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> also

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
twenty two millimeters now we can also

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
twenty two millimeters now we can also
apply<00:01:01.050> constants<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:01.890> options<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.309> that's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
apply constants or options so that's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.840 
apply constants or options so that's
simulating<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.180> constant<00:01:03.899> changing<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.439> load

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
simulating a constant changing in load

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.570 
simulating a constant changing in load
so<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> system<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.390> learn<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:08.220> there's<00:01:08.460> an

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so the system will learn that there's an

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
so the system will learn that there's an
extra<00:01:08.850> load<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:09.930> attempt<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
extra load and it will attempt to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
extra load and it will attempt to
readjust<00:01:10.860> itself<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> most<00:01:12.390> optimum

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
readjust itself to the most optimum

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.600 
readjust itself to the most optimum
frequency<00:01:13.890> yeah<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> optimum

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
frequency yeah as well as the optimum

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.210 
frequency yeah as well as the optimum
PWM<00:01:18.259> if<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> doesn't<00:01:19.680> take<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> correct

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
PWM if it doesn't take the correct

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060 
PWM if it doesn't take the correct
frequency<00:01:20.369> it'll<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:20.970> through<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:22.080> frequency

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
frequency it'll go through the frequency

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
frequency it'll go through the frequency
sweep<00:01:23.250> multiple<00:01:23.610> times<00:01:23.820> until<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
sweep multiple times until they get the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.999 
sweep multiple times until they get the
right<00:01:25.159> PWM<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.180> over<00:01:27.390> here

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
right PWM and if you look over here

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.010 
right PWM and if you look over here
that's<00:01:29.009> back<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> 22<00:01:30.030> millimeters<00:01:30.479> yeah

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
that's back to 22 millimeters yeah

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.320 
that's back to 22 millimeters yeah
show<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:34.700> quite<00:01:35.060> not<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.330> see<00:01:35.480> on<00:01:35.570> this

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
show that it's quite not to see on this

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.950 
show that it's quite not to see on this
you<00:01:38.330> go<00:01:38.980> 22<00:01:39.980> millimeters<00:01:42.370> then<00:01:43.840> what<00:01:44.840> else

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
you go 22 millimeters then what else

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.710 
you go 22 millimeters then what else
collision<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.920> true<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.240> if<00:01:47.450> there's<00:01:47.630> a

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
collision is a true so if there's a

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.830 
collision is a true so if there's a
collision<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:49.910> green<00:01:50.450> LED<00:01:50.750> will

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
collision that little green LED will

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.680 
collision that little green LED will
turn<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:51.229> over<00:01:51.440> here<00:01:51.560> yep<00:01:51.950> god<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:52.970> then

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
turn on over here yep god that and then

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.060 
turn on over here yep god that and then
it<00:01:53.810> will<00:01:53.900> attempt<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.229> figure<00:01:54.440> up<00:01:54.619> that's<00:01:54.860> dead

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
it will attempt to figure up that's dead

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.040 
it will attempt to figure up that's dead
time<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.000> after<00:01:56.300> that<00:01:56.420> will<00:01:56.540> attempt<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.900> fix

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
time and after that will attempt to fix

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.640 
time and after that will attempt to fix
it<00:01:57.229> sighs<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.710> are<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.220> we<00:01:58.400> have<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:59.080> timer<00:02:00.080> so

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
it sighs we are so we have a timer so

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.200 
it sighs we are so we have a timer so
after<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> minute<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:01.850> thirty<00:02:02.240> pretty<00:02:02.570> much

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
after a minute and thirty pretty much

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.630 
after a minute and thirty pretty much
the<00:02:05.210> whole<00:02:05.570> thing<00:02:05.899> turns<00:02:06.590> off<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.220> simulate

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the whole thing turns off to simulate

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.639 
the whole thing turns off to simulate
their<00:02:08.030> five<00:02:08.330> minute<00:02:08.570> on<00:02:08.720> time<00:02:09.020> in<00:02:09.200> five<00:02:09.440> minute

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
their five minute on time in five minute

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.000 
their five minute on time in five minute
off<00:02:09.800> time<00:02:10.239> which<00:02:11.239> was<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.870> think<00:02:12.200> required<00:02:12.890> by

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
off time which was I think required by

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.920 
off time which was I think required by
first<00:02:13.220> level<00:02:13.640> like<00:02:13.910> we<00:02:14.390> were<00:02:14.540> told<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
first level like we were told in the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.150 
first level like we were told in the
design<00:02:15.350> me<00:02:15.530> yeah<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.850> yeah<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.320> just<00:02:19.010> for

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
design me yeah so yeah so like just for

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.650 
design me yeah so yeah so like just for
this<00:02:19.480> just<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:21.880> demonstration<00:02:22.880> we

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
this just for this demonstration we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.630 
this just for this demonstration we
turned<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.110> off<00:02:24.260> only<00:02:24.560> for<00:02:24.709> 30<00:02:25.040> seconds<00:02:25.400> just

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
turned it off only for 30 seconds just

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.010 
turned it off only for 30 seconds just
to<00:02:25.870> speed<00:02:26.870> things<00:02:26.900> up<00:02:27.940> yes<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.510> after<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
to speed things up yes so after the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.050 
to speed things up yes so after the
timer<00:02:30.230> finishes<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.250> turns<00:02:31.610> back<00:02:31.730> it's<00:02:31.940> all

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
timer finishes it turns back it's all
