00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 ah 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 and a goal interest rates here they 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.440
 I bring a video and today we are going to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 see how to change the name of the bill 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.770
 ayers or the villagers in minecraft of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 xbox and playstation good first that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.740
 all I want to tell you that only 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 can do this in creative since of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.250
 otherwise they will not be able to change the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.410
 name but once they are in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 creative it is very simple to change the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.180
 name you just have to put a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.769
 anvil grab a villager egg what 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.290
 we put in here and instead of that 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:41.130
 say townsville yesterday we changed you and you 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.559
 we put for example pop then we have 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.379
 the name that we want here that will be pop 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.989
 Villager grabbed the huevito ie 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.579
 the spawn and we put it anywhere 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.640
 can see says pop and if not we put 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.039
 there says pop or first emerald pop pop pop 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 pop dares everything that says here is pop and 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.730
 this seems as quite a trick 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 interesting if we want to do as a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 only for this reason, where I am, I do not know 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.560
 the savior villager or the dean or not be 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.310
 you are seek to say no one in that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 it escaped me then nothing and fast 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 people, it's worth mentioning that if we do 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 of the colors in minecraft we can 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.390
 also change the color to the names 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.500
 of our villagers as you can see me 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.360
 I put here and it says sun 12 sun but if it 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 we see from afar no more says sun and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 because it says here it is sunny it is sunny 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.320
 because this is the way we can 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 change the name of our villagers or 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
 in any other way or even from the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.050
 posters in minecraft this les 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 I recommend before that they want to change 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.850
 name the villagers so look 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 my other videos where says how 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 change the name to two modes or that of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.429
 the posters how to change the color to 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.350
 the letter of the posters because with that 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.420
 they will understand much better and they are already three 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.890
 times I explain how to do this well 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 that here I will simply explain it in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.690
 short that is that you get an egg of 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 aldeanueva here and you write this symbol 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.700
 which is only on the keyboard of 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.310
 english here you put it and you write a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.649
 letter of the aa the fo number of 19 and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.400
 I'm going to put 1 and we're going to put this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.379
 x is until then we put this here and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.180
 when we named the villager rather 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.980
 when we invoke him he will change his 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.780
 name and now it's going to be blue like 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.090
 can see 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.500
 so I recommend that if you want 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.730
 know all the colors and all the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.170
 color combinations go to 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.930
 any of the other two videos that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.300
 I tell them how to change the color to 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.830
 the letters on the posters or the others 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
 names of the mobile phones but what has 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 liked this little trick if it was like that 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.700
 leave your like here I say goodbye goodbye
