two<00:04:24.160> because<00:04:24.370> if<00:04:24.490> as<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.700> can<00:04:24.790> see<00:04:24.910> it's<00:04:25.060> quite

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
two because if as you can see it's quite

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.020 
two because if as you can see it's quite
a<00:04:25.300> bit<00:04:25.480> bigger<00:04:25.660> than<00:04:25.870> that<00:04:26.800> one<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.730> maybe

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
a bit bigger than that one so that maybe

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.210 
a bit bigger than that one so that maybe
two<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.750> there<00:04:28.870> may<00:04:28.960> be<00:04:28.990> three<00:04:29.380> there<00:04:29.710> but

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
two so there may be three there but

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
two so there may be three there but
either<00:04:30.310> way<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.700> two<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.090> bullets

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
either way the two of the bullets

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.850 
either way the two of the bullets
missing<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:32.740> sent<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> couple<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.520> flyers<00:04:33.760> so

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
missing it sent a couple of flyers so

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.890 
missing it sent a couple of flyers so
very<00:04:35.860> cool<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.400> had<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.030> riot<00:04:37.360> shooting<00:04:37.810> I've

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
very cool I had a riot shooting I've

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.430 
very cool I had a riot shooting I've
been<00:04:38.050> shooting<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.500> ton<00:04:38.980> lately<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:41.260> took

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
been shooting a ton lately and it took

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.050 
been shooting a ton lately and it took
me<00:04:41.620> forever<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:42.070> break<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.490> barrel<00:04:42.790> in<00:04:42.910> on

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
me forever to break the barrel in on

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.880 
me forever to break the barrel in on
this<00:04:43.210> gun<00:04:43.450> cuz<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.020> literally<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.500> know<00:04:44.620> took<00:04:44.680> a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
this gun cuz I literally you know took a

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.790 
this gun cuz I literally you know took a
shot<00:04:45.190> cleaned<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:45.970> took<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.600> shot<00:04:46.930> cleaned<00:04:47.500> it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
shot cleaned it took a shot cleaned it

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.950 
shot cleaned it took a shot cleaned it
and<00:04:48.040> I<00:04:48.280> did<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.700> for<00:04:48.940> basically<00:04:49.330> two<00:04:49.810> days

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
and I did that for basically two days

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.260 
and I did that for basically two days
that's<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.320> range<00:04:50.580> breaking<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:51.730> Barrel<00:04:52.120> in

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
that's a range breaking this Barrel in

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.660 
that's a range breaking this Barrel in
because<00:04:53.230> I<00:04:53.260> really<00:04:53.470> wanted<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.010> be<00:04:54.220> as

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
because I really wanted it to be as

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.060 
because I really wanted it to be as
accurate<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.240> humanly<00:04:55.630> possible<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.980> think

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
accurate as humanly possible and I think

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.650 
accurate as humanly possible and I think
the<00:04:57.340> results<00:04:57.700> are<00:04:57.790> pretty<00:04:57.970> pretty<00:04:58.960> good<00:04:59.230> for<00:04:59.500> a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
the results are pretty pretty good for a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.840 
the results are pretty pretty good for a
custom<00:05:01.660> build<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.020> know<00:05:02.050> especially<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.560> $700

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
custom build you know especially a $700

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.880 
custom build you know especially a $700
let's<00:05:04.480> fight<00:05:04.630> about<00:05:04.750> 800<00:05:05.170> I<00:05:05.200> have<00:05:05.320> into<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.530> now

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
let's fight about 800 I have into it now

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.480 
let's fight about 800 I have into it now
an<00:05:06.010> 800<00:05:06.490> dollar<00:05:06.520> var<00:05:06.910> meter<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:08.310> not<00:05:09.310> bad

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
an 800 dollar var meter and not bad

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.190 
an 800 dollar var meter and not bad
results<00:05:09.910> as<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.030> can<00:05:10.210> see<00:05:10.300> these<00:05:10.480> squares<00:05:10.870> are

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
results as you can see these squares are

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.850 
results as you can see these squares are
one<00:05:11.500> inch<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:12.610> there<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:13.410> only<00:05:14.410> about<00:05:14.800> a

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
one inch so that there is only about a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.010 
one inch so that there is only about a
half<00:05:15.100> inch<00:05:15.310> group<00:05:15.550> at<00:05:15.700> 100<00:05:16.030> yards<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.570> that's

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
half inch group at 100 yards and that's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.970 
half inch group at 100 yards and that's
using<00:05:17.230> a<00:05:17.500> 3<00:05:17.830> by<00:05:17.980> 9<00:05:18.180> scope<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:20.470> will<00:05:20.620> improve

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
using a 3 by 9 scope that will improve

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.740 
using a 3 by 9 scope that will improve
with<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.220> better<00:05:21.370> scope<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:22.000> also<00:05:22.180> has<00:05:22.540> the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
with a better scope and it also has the

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.020 
with a better scope and it also has the
standard<00:05:23.260> trigger<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:23.980> came<00:05:24.220> with<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.460> I

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
standard trigger that came with it I

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.150 
standard trigger that came with it I
think<00:05:25.690> with<00:05:25.780> an<00:05:25.900> upgraded<00:05:26.260> trigger<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.800> scope

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
think with an upgraded trigger and scope

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
think with an upgraded trigger and scope
these<00:05:27.850> groups<00:05:28.270> will<00:05:29.130> go<00:05:30.130> down<00:05:30.310> slow<00:05:30.670> there's

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
these groups will go down slow there's

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.910 
these groups will go down slow there's
not<00:05:31.360> much<00:05:31.600> more<00:05:31.780> room<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.170> get<00:05:32.290> that<00:05:32.440> down<00:05:32.680> much

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
not much more room to get that down much

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.890 
not much more room to get that down much
smaller<00:05:33.220> but<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.180> think<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:37.120> know<00:05:37.240> maybe<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.690> 4

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
smaller but I think you know maybe a 4

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.170 
smaller but I think you know maybe a 4
by<00:05:38.020> 12<00:05:38.260> scope<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.890> two-stage<00:05:39.730> trigger<00:05:39.970> I

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
by 12 scope and a two-stage trigger I

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.270 
by 12 scope and a two-stage trigger I
think<00:05:40.420> that<00:05:40.570> might<00:05:40.780> tighten<00:05:41.170> up<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:42.160> know

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
think that might tighten up you know

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.670 
think that might tighten up you know
maybe<00:05:42.580> 10<00:05:42.910> or<00:05:42.940> 20<00:05:43.420> percent<00:05:43.600> who<00:05:44.140> knows<00:05:44.350> but

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
maybe 10 or 20 percent who knows but

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.130 
maybe 10 or 20 percent who knows but
very<00:05:45.370> happy<00:05:45.730> with<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:45.940> gun<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.390> just<00:05:46.420> wanted

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
very happy with the gun and just wanted

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.370 
very happy with the gun and just wanted
to<00:05:47.170> share<00:05:47.820> because<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:50.640> feel<00:05:51.640> like<00:05:51.670> bragging

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
to share because I feel like bragging

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.050 
to share because I feel like bragging
but<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.440> am<00:05:53.590> gonna<00:05:53.740> continue<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.190> try<00:05:54.460> more<00:05:54.730> ammo

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
but I am gonna continue to try more ammo

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.970 
but I am gonna continue to try more ammo
I'm<00:05:55.360> gonna<00:05:55.600> be<00:05:55.720> what<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.140> do<00:05:56.260> is<00:05:56.440> when<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.620> do<00:05:56.740> this

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
I'm gonna be what I do is when I do this

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.460 
I'm gonna be what I do is when I do this
I<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.610> keep<00:05:58.570> these<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:58.930> I<00:05:58.960> have<00:05:59.140> like<00:05:59.260> a<00:05:59.320> little

I I keep these and I have like a little

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.010 
I I keep these and I have like a little

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
which which circle and so I'm gonna try

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.110 
which which circle and so I'm gonna try
a<00:06:04.990> few<00:06:05.320> more<00:06:05.380> ammo<00:06:05.920> I<00:06:06.070> want<00:06:06.280> to<00:06:06.340> try<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.610> match

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
a few more ammo I want to try a match

to<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.650> 2<00:06:14.800> 2<00:06:14.980> 3<00:06:15.220> and<00:06:15.760> then<00:06:15.850> I'll<00:06:16.000> kind<00:06:16.120> of<00:06:16.240> make

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
to the 2 2 3 and then I'll kind of make

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.120 
to the 2 2 3 and then I'll kind of make
a<00:06:16.390> decision<00:06:16.870> as<00:06:16.990> to<00:06:17.020> which<00:06:17.290> one<00:06:17.350> I'm<00:06:17.800> going<00:06:18.010> to

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
a decision as to which one I'm going to

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.410 
a decision as to which one I'm going to
sack<00:06:18.340> up<00:06:18.370> on<00:06:18.730> but<00:06:19.540> I'll<00:06:19.660> probably<00:06:19.870> use<00:06:20.350> this

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
sack up on but I'll probably use this

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.470 
sack up on but I'll probably use this
Horn<00:06:22.420> of<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:22.630> Super<00:06:23.200> garment<00:06:23.800> there<00:06:23.980> for

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
Horn of the Super garment there for

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.190 
Horn of the Super garment there for
ground<00:06:25.480> hog<00:06:25.690> hunting

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
ground hog hunting

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.090 
ground hog hunting
and<00:06:26.290> then<00:06:26.770> I'll<00:06:26.950> probably<00:06:27.160> use<00:06:27.490> this<00:06:27.940> federal

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
and then I'll probably use this federal

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.090 
and then I'll probably use this federal
as<00:06:30.210> just<00:06:31.210> my<00:06:31.420> kind<00:06:31.630> of<00:06:31.750> stack<00:06:32.020> up<00:06:32.230> shit<00:06:32.950> hits

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
as just my kind of stack up shit hits

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.090 
as just my kind of stack up shit hits
the<00:06:33.190> fan<00:06:33.280> ammo<00:06:33.820> but<00:06:34.620> maybe<00:06:35.620> if<00:06:35.770> it's<00:06:35.920> just

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
the fan ammo but maybe if it's just

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.470 
the fan ammo but maybe if it's just
going<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.490> range<00:06:36.610> for<00:06:36.790> fun<00:06:37.030> shooting<00:06:37.330> I

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
going to the range for fun shooting I

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.760 
going to the range for fun shooting I
might<00:06:37.630> do<00:06:37.750> that<00:06:37.810> cuz<00:06:38.080> it's<00:06:38.200> kind<00:06:38.350> of<00:06:38.410> cheaper

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
might do that cuz it's kind of cheaper

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.070 
might do that cuz it's kind of cheaper
but<00:06:39.010> we'll<00:06:39.160> see<00:06:39.340> but<00:06:40.050> good<00:06:41.050> price<00:06:41.320> ranges

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
but we'll see but good price ranges

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.450 
but we'll see but good price ranges
