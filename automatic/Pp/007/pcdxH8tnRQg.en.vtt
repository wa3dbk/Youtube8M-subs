interesting part about all of this is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.459 
interesting part about all of this is
they're<00:00:11.340> not<00:00:11.490> even<00:00:11.969> from<00:00:12.120> Ireland<00:00:12.599> or<00:00:12.750> Iceland

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
conditions so now they call them bells

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
conditions so now they call them bells

they were nicknamed bells of Ireland

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.979 
they were nicknamed bells of Ireland
because<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.760> look<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.600> national

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
people when they think of green they

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.959 
people when they think of green they
think<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> Saint<00:00:47.160> Patrick's<00:00:47.520> Day<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.850> they

think of Saint Patrick's Day and they

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.479

think<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> Irish<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.590> they're<00:00:49.920> easy<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
think of the Irish so they're easy to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
think of the Irish so they're easy to
grow<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:51.059> long<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> realize<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> they're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
grow as long as you realize that they're

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
grow as long as you realize that they're
not<00:00:52.649> Hardy<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.430> cold<00:00:53.760> climates<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.449> not

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
not Hardy in cold climates they will not

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.389 
not Hardy in cold climates they will not
make<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.870> over<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> winter<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
make it over the winter so you have to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.670 
make it over the winter so you have to
start<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:56.969> as<00:00:57.180> an<00:00:57.329> annual<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> live

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
start them out as an annual if you live

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
start them out as an annual if you live
in<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> warm<00:00:59.100> climate<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.879> grow<00:01:00.090> them

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
in a warm climate you can grow them

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
in a warm climate you can grow them
outside<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.870> they'll<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.170> back<00:01:01.289> by<00:01:01.649> seed

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
outside and they'll come back by seed

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
outside and they'll come back by seed
from<00:01:02.100> year<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> year<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.300> live<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.690> cold

from year to year if you live in a cold
climate<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> start<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:05.939> seed

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

now<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:11.939> starting<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:12.840> seed<00:01:13.229> they're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
now when starting them from seed they're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
now when starting them from seed they're
just<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.189> small<00:01:14.520> seed<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.420> put

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just a very small seed and you can put

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.899 
just a very small seed and you can put
that<00:01:15.720> right<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> soil<00:01:16.590> whenever<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> has

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
quit freezing I usually like to wait

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
quit freezing I usually like to wait
even<00:01:20.159> later<00:01:20.400> into<00:01:20.850> June<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> found

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
even later into June because I found

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.289 
even later into June because I found
there<00:01:22.770> later<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.189> start<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.640> warmer

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
there later you start with warmer

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.670 
there later you start with warmer
climate<00:01:24.720> plants<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> better<00:01:25.409> they<00:01:25.619> do

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
climate plants the better they do

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
climate plants the better they do
because<00:01:26.610> naturally<00:01:27.060> they<00:01:27.240> will<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.570> grow

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
because naturally they will not grow

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.590 
because naturally they will not grow
under<00:01:28.350> maybe<00:01:28.500> even<00:01:28.860> 6070<00:01:29.640> degrees<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.450> he

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
under maybe even 6070 degrees so he

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.609 
under maybe even 6070 degrees so he
start<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.900> too<00:01:30.990> early<00:01:31.020> they're<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.500> going

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
start them too early they're not going

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.800 
start them too early they're not going
to<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.770> anything<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.159> rot<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.509> easiest

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to do anything but rot so the easiest

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
to do anything but rot so the easiest
way<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> start<00:01:34.200> seeds<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> seed<00:01:35.189> trays<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
way to start seeds is in seed trays and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
way to start seeds is in seed trays and
I<00:01:36.360> found<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.960> by<00:01:37.079> putting<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.590> couple<00:01:37.770> seeds

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I found just by putting a couple seeds

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.149 
I found just by putting a couple seeds
in<00:01:38.670> each<00:01:38.820> tray<00:01:41.210> bit<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> spoon<00:01:42.979> they<00:01:43.979> can

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
in each tray bit on a spoon they can

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.319 
in each tray bit on a spoon they can
thin<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.670> too

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
thin it out too

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
thin it out too
but<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> easiest<00:01:46.350> way<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.880> bit

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
but the easiest way is just a little bit

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.800 
but the easiest way is just a little bit
a<00:01:48.060> few<00:01:48.840> seeds<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.380> each<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.270> scatter<00:01:51.659> them

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a few seeds in each and scatter them

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.870 
a few seeds in each and scatter them
around<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.220> try<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> cover

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
around and then you can try to cover

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.730 
around and then you can try to cover
them<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.570> found<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> easier<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> put

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
them up but I found it easier to put

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.280 
them up but I found it easier to put
another<00:01:55.979> layer<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.729> soil<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.450> top<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.960> even

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
another layer of soil on top not even

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.249 
another layer of soil on top not even
more<00:01:58.469> than<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.829> quarter<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> our<00:01:59.490> half<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.909> inch

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.690 

and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> water<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.310> make<00:02:05.670> sure

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and then when you water it in make sure

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
and then when you water it in make sure
that<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.119> use<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> mister<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.500> not

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that you use a mister so that you're not

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.080 
that you use a mister so that you're not
using<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.039> heavy<00:02:08.250> stream<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.789> everything

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
using a heavy stream that's everything

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
using a heavy stream that's everything
that's<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> flow<00:02:09.660> back<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.860> can

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that's going to flow back out or you can

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's going to flow back out or you can
put<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.489> piece<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> cloth<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.450> our<00:02:13.050> sheet

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
put a piece of cloth on it our sheet

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.449 
put a piece of cloth on it our sheet
and<00:02:13.959> then<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.379> way<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> water<00:02:14.890> doesn't<00:02:15.220> just

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and then that way the water doesn't just

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.820 
and then that way the water doesn't just
flash<00:02:15.909> right<00:02:16.330> into<00:02:16.659> it<00:02:16.750> it'll<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.200> sink

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
flash right into it it'll just sink

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.280 
flash right into it it'll just sink
slowly<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.549> drip<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.750> goal<00:02:19.989> so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
slowly and drip and that's the goal so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.680 
slowly and drip and that's the goal so
that<00:02:20.440> they<00:02:20.560> stay<00:02:20.830> moist<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> water

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
that they stay moist but the water

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.930 
that they stay moist but the water
doesn't<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.019> drain<00:02:23.440> right<00:02:23.680> out<00:02:23.890> once<00:02:24.760> they

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
doesn't just drain right out once they

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.880 
doesn't just drain right out once they
start<00:02:25.239> growing<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.349> transplant<00:02:26.769> them

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
start growing you can transplant them

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
start growing you can transplant them
out<00:02:27.099> into<00:02:27.370> containers<00:02:27.879> or<00:02:28.060> right<00:02:28.209> out<00:02:28.239> into

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
out into containers or right out into

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720 
out into containers or right out into
the<00:02:28.720> garden<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.230> then<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:29.980> will<00:02:30.159> bloom<00:02:30.400> by

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the garden and then they will bloom by

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.030 
the garden and then they will bloom by
late<00:02:30.970> summer<00:02:31.379> usually<00:02:32.379> into<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.829> fall

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
late summer usually into the fall

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.619 
late summer usually into the fall
sometimes<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.640> depends<00:02:33.879> on<00:02:33.970> your<00:02:34.120> climate<00:02:34.360> if

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
sometimes it depends on your climate if

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.670 
sometimes it depends on your climate if
you<00:02:34.659> live<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.989> warmer<00:02:35.290> climate<00:02:35.319> they're

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you live in a warmer climate they're

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.199 
you live in a warmer climate they're
gonna<00:02:35.799> bloom<00:02:36.010> much<00:02:36.280> earlier<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.940> spring

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
gonna bloom much earlier in the spring

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.850 
gonna bloom much earlier in the spring
if<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:37.720> live<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.049> colder<00:02:38.409> climate<00:02:38.440> they're

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
if you live in a colder climate they're

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.649 
if you live in a colder climate they're
gonna<00:02:38.950> bloom<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.519> summer<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> found

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
gonna bloom in the summer so I found

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.600 
gonna bloom in the summer so I found
that<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:40.989> most<00:02:41.319> plants<00:02:41.860> they<00:02:42.099> will<00:02:42.129> bloom<00:02:42.430> at

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
that with most plants they will bloom at

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.100 
that with most plants they will bloom at
different<00:02:42.640> times<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.239> different<00:02:43.629> locations

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
different times in different locations

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.920 
different times in different locations
but<00:02:44.349> they're<00:02:44.980> easy<00:02:45.310> plant<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.790> grow<00:02:46.060> from<00:02:46.569> seed

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
but they're easy plant to grow from seed

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.690 
but they're easy plant to grow from seed
and<00:02:47.200> they're<00:02:47.560> gorgeous<00:02:47.829> addition<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.609> your

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and they're gorgeous addition to your

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.480
