and yeah the HTC one s feels really good
with<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.380> unibody<00:02:20.340> design<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:21.000> feels<00:02:21.240> really

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
with this unibody design it feels really

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.930 
with this unibody design it feels really
solid<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.770> also<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.160> little<00:02:23.310> bit<00:02:23.430> slippery

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
solid but also a little bit slippery

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.510 
solid but also a little bit slippery
because<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.720> has<00:02:24.840> no<00:02:25.110> real<00:02:25.380> texture<00:02:25.890> over<00:02:26.220> here

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
because it has no real texture over here

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.600 
because it has no real texture over here
and<00:02:26.730> also<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.680> color<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.430> it's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and also you see this color so it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.660 
and also you see this color so it's
lighter<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.750> darker<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
lighter here and darker here this it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.020 
lighter here and darker here this it
looks<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.300> really<00:02:33.750> cool<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:37.610> as<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.790> said

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
looks really really cool and as I said

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.360 
looks really really cool and as I said
before<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.630> display<00:02:40.350> resolution<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
before the display resolution is a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.370 
before the display resolution is a
little<00:02:41.850> bit<00:02:42.000> different<00:02:42.420> both<00:02:42.660> devices<00:02:43.080> are

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
little bit different both devices are

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.550 
little bit different both devices are
running<00:02:43.770> android<00:02:44.760> 4.0<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.020> compare<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
running android 4.0 you can compare it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.180 
running android 4.0 you can compare it
but<00:02:47.340> we've<00:02:47.700> got<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.210> similar<00:02:48.960> super<00:02:49.680> amoled

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
but we've got a similar super amoled

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.250 
but we've got a similar super amoled
plus<00:02:50.400> display<00:02:51.300> over<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:52.140> which<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.930> better

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
plus display over here which is better

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.430 
plus display over here which is better
because<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.890> has<00:02:56.160> another<00:02:56.550> matrix<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.660> here

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
because it has another matrix and here

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.680 
because it has another matrix and here
we've<00:02:58.560> got<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.610> super<00:02:59.940> amoled<00:03:00.330> display

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
we've got just a super amoled display

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.690 
we've got just a super amoled display
which<00:03:00.930> has<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.760> pentile<00:03:02.760> matt<00:03:03.060> matrix<00:03:03.750> and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
which has a pentile matt matrix and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.760 
which has a pentile matt matrix and
although<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.880> resolution<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.510> higher<00:03:06.810> you

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
although the resolution is higher you

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.110 
although the resolution is higher you
sometimes<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.670> color<00:03:09.180> fringing<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:10.260> um<00:03:11.120> text

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
sometimes see color fringing and um text

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.630 
sometimes see color fringing and um text
is<00:03:12.270> not<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.930> sharp<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.250> look<00:03:14.400> at<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
is not so sharp but if you look at the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.780 
is not so sharp but if you look at the
app<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:16.550> our<00:03:17.550> do<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:19.170> see<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
app of our do you see that because the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.490 
app of our do you see that because the
resolution<00:03:21.270> is<00:03:21.360> lower<00:03:21.660> when<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:22.080> samsung

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
resolution is lower when your samsung

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.300 
resolution is lower when your samsung
galaxys<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:24.210> graphics<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.990> ya<00:03:26.240> bigger

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
galaxys to the graphics are ya bigger

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.450 
galaxys to the graphics are ya bigger
but<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:30.060> HTC<00:03:30.510> One<00:03:30.690> S<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.560> little<00:03:32.310> bit

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
but the HTC One S is a little bit

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.360 
but the HTC One S is a little bit
sharper<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.180> display<00:03:33.390> even<00:03:33.960> more<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
sharper you can display even more on the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.470 
sharper you can display even more on the
same<00:03:35.610> screen<00:03:36.000> size<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:37.110> also<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.970> samsung

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
same screen size and also the samsung

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.940 
same screen size and also the samsung
galaxy<00:03:39.960> s2<00:03:40.140> has<00:03:40.860> some<00:03:41.700> yeah<00:03:42.630> bluish<00:03:43.500> display

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
galaxy s2 has some yeah bluish display

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.100 
galaxy s2 has some yeah bluish display
if<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.220> compare<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.270> emphasis

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
if you compare it to this one emphasis

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:56.730 
if you compare it to this one emphasis
the<00:03:47.040> whites<00:03:47.280> are<00:03:47.580> whiter<00:03:48.510> on<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.640> HTC<00:03:50.640> One<00:03:50.820> S

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.060 

yeah<00:03:57.370> um<00:03:57.870> in<00:03:58.870> terms<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.260> performance<00:03:59.470> we've

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
yeah um in terms of performance we've

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.210 
yeah um in terms of performance we've
got<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.360> one<00:04:01.360> gigabyte<00:04:01.750> RAM<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.260> both<00:04:02.740> of<00:04:02.980> them

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
got a one gigabyte RAM on both of them

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.420 
got a one gigabyte RAM on both of them
and<00:04:04.800> at<00:04:05.800> one<00:04:06.070> point<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.670> do<00:04:06.880> hurts<00:04:07.590> exynos<00:04:08.590> SOC

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
and at one point to do hurts exynos SOC

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.080 
and at one point to do hurts exynos SOC
on<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.850> Samsung<00:04:10.360> which<00:04:10.990> is<00:04:11.430> yeah<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.880> newest

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
on the Samsung which is yeah the newest

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.270 
on the Samsung which is yeah the newest
generation<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:14.250> 2011<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:16.140> on<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.260> HTC<00:04:17.680> One<00:04:18.010> S

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
generation of 2011 and on the HTC One S

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.530 
generation of 2011 and on the HTC One S
we've<00:04:18.820> got<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.660> new<00:04:20.260> Qualcomm<00:04:20.920> as<00:04:21.190> for<00:04:21.580> 1.5

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
we've got a new Qualcomm as for 1.5

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.840 
we've got a new Qualcomm as for 1.5
gigahertz<00:04:22.930> processor<00:04:23.310> which<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.490> really

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
gigahertz processor which is really

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.020 
gigahertz processor which is really
really<00:04:25.210> fast<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:26.650> even<00:04:26.920> faster<00:04:27.280> than<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
really fast so it's even faster than the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.500 
really fast so it's even faster than the
Samsung<00:04:29.430> Exynos<00:04:30.480> SOC<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.820> can<00:04:33.970> see<00:04:34.210> um

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
Samsung Exynos SOC and you can see um

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.850 
Samsung Exynos SOC and you can see um
let's<00:04:35.500> take<00:04:35.940> for<00:04:36.940> example<00:04:37.030> Facebook<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:41.560> see

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
let's take for example Facebook you see

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.760 
let's take for example Facebook you see
this<00:04:42.100> is<00:04:42.310> slightly<00:04:42.940> faster<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:44.230> you<00:04:44.260> don't

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
this is slightly faster so you don't

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:53.220 
this is slightly faster so you don't
really<00:04:46.590> yeah<00:04:50.700> it's<00:04:51.700> not<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.330> big<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:53.080> a

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
really yeah it's not that big of a

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.300 
really yeah it's not that big of a
difference<00:04:54.780> here<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:55.900> faster<00:04:56.380> because<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
difference here is faster because the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.990 
difference here is faster because the
distal<00:04:57.640> resolution<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.510> lower<00:04:58.860> but<00:04:59.860> still<00:05:00.000> in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
distal resolution is lower but still in

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.800 
distal resolution is lower but still in
benchmarks<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:02.020> HTC<00:05:02.590> One<00:05:02.770> S<00:05:02.980> is<00:05:03.280> just<00:05:03.750> he<00:05:04.750> has

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
benchmarks the HTC One S is just he has

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.340 
benchmarks the HTC One S is just he has
some<00:05:05.110> points<00:05:05.440> ahead<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:06.040> in<00:05:06.340> real<00:05:06.700> life<00:05:06.760> but

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
some points ahead but in real life but

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
some points ahead but in real life but
don't<00:05:08.350> really<00:05:08.830> doesn't<00:05:09.370> really<00:05:09.550> matter<00:05:11.370> yeah

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
don't really doesn't really matter yeah

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.840 
don't really doesn't really matter yeah
um<00:05:12.630> one<00:05:13.630> big<00:05:14.260> difference<00:05:14.530> is<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:14.980> web

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
um one big difference is that web

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.200 
um one big difference is that web
Samsung<00:05:16.420> you've<00:05:16.720> got<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.260> microSD<00:05:18.190> slot<00:05:18.220> just

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
Samsung you've got a microSD slot just

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.250 
Samsung you've got a microSD slot just
behind<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.750> cover<00:05:20.050> so<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.750> internal<00:05:22.750> memory

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
behind this cover so the internal memory

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.580 
behind this cover so the internal memory
of<00:05:23.380> 16<00:05:23.860> gigabyte<00:05:24.370> can<00:05:25.210> be<00:05:25.450> upgraded<00:05:25.690> but<00:05:26.410> with

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
of 16 gigabyte can be upgraded but with

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.060 
of 16 gigabyte can be upgraded but with
HTC<00:05:27.220> One<00:05:27.400> S<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:28.210> can<00:05:28.510> be<00:05:28.750> so<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.110> get<00:05:29.500> extra

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
HTC One S it can be so you get extra

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.560 
HTC One S it can be so you get extra

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
gigabyte with a new HTC device that is

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.500 
gigabyte with a new HTC device that is
just<00:05:38.020> all<00:05:38.200> online<00:05:38.680> memory<00:05:40.980> so<00:05:41.980> you<00:05:42.760> are<00:05:42.790> stuck

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510
