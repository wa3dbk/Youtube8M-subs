have a week left here in the States
well<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> States<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.310> home

well I'm not in the States but here home

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.200 
well I'm not in the States but here home
before<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.710> Vegas<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:20.610> practice

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
before we go to Vegas and then practice

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
before we go to Vegas and then practice
and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.630> we're<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:25.009> China<00:01:26.009> after<00:01:26.310> that
