00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:10.332
 Welcome to the intensive course of the Retribution paladin. 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.626
 In this video we will briefly explain what you have to do 

00:00:14.903 --> 00:00:18.000
 to play with the Retribution paladin at level 90. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.130
 Its damage rotation focuses on accumulating and spending Holy Power. 

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:27.783
 Like all paladins, Retribution has a mana bar 

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:30.813
 but you will not have to worry much about her 

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.941
 focus on the Sacred Power. 

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.338
 Before fighting, launch Blessing of power. 

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:42.254
 It is a great benefit for mastery, which will increase the damage. 

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.117
 You must also activate Seal of Truth 

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.916
 to increase the melee damage. 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.151
 In combat, use Crusader Strike whenever you can 

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.550
 followed by Sentence and Exorcism. 

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.329
 Each one will generate 1 p. of Holy Power on impact 

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:00.620
 so use them whenever you can. 

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:05.243
 Automatic attacks can restart Exorcism. 

00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:08.499
 When this happens, a message will appear on the screen. 

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:13.843
 If the target's health is less than 20%, you can use an anger hammer 

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.803
 that also generates Sacred Power and inflicts considerable damage. 

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:22.514
 When you reach 3 charges of Holy Power, use them for Templar Verdict. 

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:24.338
 It is the most powerful attack. 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.483
 There is much to learn to master the paladin 

00:01:28.658 --> 00:01:32.778
 but we hope we have helped you a little to move in the right direction. 

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:37.395
 When you have an idea, you should study carefully 

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.239
 the book of spells, talents and glyphs 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.366
 to see what we have not mentioned here. 

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.182
 Thank you very much and see you in Draenor!
