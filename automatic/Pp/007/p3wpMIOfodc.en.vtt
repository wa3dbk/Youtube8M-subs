look a bit better

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
look a bit better
hard<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> tell<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.860> goo<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
hard to tell with a goo on there the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
hard to tell with a goo on there the
problem<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.360> running<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
problem I was running into I think is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.210 
problem I was running into I think is
that<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.369> paint<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.970> cold<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.920> definitely

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that my paint is so cold it's definitely

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.350 
that my paint is so cold it's definitely
making<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.490> change<00:01:29.729> now<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.579> Gangu<00:01:32.909> residue<00:01:33.240> on

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
making a change now and Gangu residue on

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230 
making a change now and Gangu residue on
so<00:01:33.630> basically<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.140> went<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> smaller<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so basically I went with the smaller the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.670 
so basically I went with the smaller the
smaller<00:01:36.360> piece<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> larger<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.470> for

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
smaller piece there's a larger one for

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.069 
smaller piece there's a larger one for
bigger<00:01:37.829> dents<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.250> guess<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:39.960> my

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
bigger dents I guess but because my

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
bigger dents I guess but because my
dentists<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.530> small<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.040> larger<00:01:41.369> one

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
dentists so small that larger one

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
dentists so small that larger one
doesn't<00:01:41.759> contact<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> whole<00:01:42.390> thing<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
doesn't contact the whole thing so I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
doesn't contact the whole thing so I
think<00:01:43.850> basically<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> end<00:01:45.390> up

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
think basically I'm just going to end up

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.050 
think basically I'm just going to end up
doing<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.490> basically<00:01:47.579> baby

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.999 
as can be which is as I'm as I figure is
probably<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.170> best<00:01:55.320> way<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.860> take

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
probably the best way to do is just take

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.999 
probably the best way to do is just take
your<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.390> forth<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.140> mean<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.890> had

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
your time and and so forth I mean I had

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.520 
your time and and so forth I mean I had
no<00:01:59.100> paint<00:01:59.310> damage<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.090> wasn't<00:02:00.530> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
no paint damage there so it wasn't you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.660 
no paint damage there so it wasn't you
know<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.860> anything<00:02:02.159> coming<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.579> better

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
know so anything coming out is better

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
know so anything coming out is better
nothing<00:02:03.119> coming<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.899> just

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
nothing coming out so I think it's just

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
nothing coming out so I think it's just
gonna<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.320> time<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.369> brought<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> heat

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
gonna take some time so I brought a heat

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.150 
gonna take some time so I brought a heat
gun<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.750> case<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> looks

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
gun out just in case but now it looks

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.350 
gun out just in case but now it looks
like<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.580> actually<00:02:08.700> seeming<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> hold<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
like it's actually seeming to hold a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.809 
like it's actually seeming to hold a
little<00:02:09.479> bit<00:02:09.569> better<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.610> maybe<00:02:11.610> we'll<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
little bit better so maybe we'll have a

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
little bit better so maybe we'll have a
little<00:02:11.849> bit<00:02:12.000> better<00:02:12.180> luck<00:02:12.390> without<00:02:12.599> having<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
little bit better luck without having to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
little bit better luck without having to
some<00:02:13.409> heat<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.799> but<00:02:13.980> I'll<00:02:14.879> be<00:02:15.000> back<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
some heat on it but I'll be back in a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.149 
some heat on it but I'll be back in a
little<00:02:15.480> bit<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.810> we'll<00:02:15.900> see<00:02:16.140> Falls<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.890> think

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
little bit and we'll see Falls I think

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.830 
little bit and we'll see Falls I think
I'm<00:02:17.519> actually<00:02:17.760> using<00:02:17.969> both<00:02:18.209> tabs<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.629> time

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
I'm actually using both tabs this time

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.970 
I'm actually using both tabs this time
want<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.079> see<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.349> works<00:02:19.500> any<00:02:19.680> better<00:02:19.859> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
want to see if it works any better the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
want to see if it works any better the
smaller<00:02:20.099> one<00:02:20.430> seems<00:02:20.609> to<00:02:20.670> hold<00:02:20.849> better<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
smaller one seems to hold better the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.349 
smaller one seems to hold better the
larger<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.879> haven't<00:02:23.879> tried<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.150> since<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
larger one I haven't tried it since the

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.170 
larger one I haven't tried it since the
first<00:02:24.599> one<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.280> did<00:02:26.280> find<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.909> key<00:02:27.060> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
first one I did find that the key is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.149 
first one I did find that the key is
basically<00:02:27.569> make<00:02:27.689> sure<00:02:27.719> that<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.230> glue<00:02:28.709> cure

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
basically make sure that the glue cure

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.949 
basically make sure that the glue cure
on<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.730> car<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:30.299> that's<00:02:30.629> part<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
on to the car I think that's part of it

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.300 
on to the car I think that's part of it
was<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.290> wasn't<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.650> letting<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:31.980> sit<00:02:32.129> long

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
was I wasn't just letting it sit long

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.640 
was I wasn't just letting it sit long
enough<00:02:32.549> maybe<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:33.959> my<00:02:34.079> issue<00:02:34.230> before

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
enough maybe that was my issue before

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
enough maybe that was my issue before
it's<00:02:35.519> definitely<00:02:35.909> better<00:02:36.180> than<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.569> was

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
it's definitely better than it was

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240 
it's definitely better than it was
there's<00:02:37.049> still<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> couple<00:02:37.379> low<00:02:37.650> spots<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.099> got

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
there's still a couple low spots I got

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.720 
there's still a couple low spots I got
to<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.430> around<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:40.040> I've<00:02:41.040> used<00:02:41.310> an<00:02:41.459> entire

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to get around to I've used an entire

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.699 
to get around to I've used an entire
glue<00:02:42.060> stick<00:02:42.329> on<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:42.959> dent<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.620> all

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
glue stick on just this one dent and all

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.170 
glue stick on just this one dent and all
the<00:02:43.769> tools<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.069> all<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.189> use<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.609> know<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> fix

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the tools are all I use you know I fix

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.920 
the tools are all I use you know I fix
30<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.659> three<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> came<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.349> but<00:02:46.700> I

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
30 with the three I came with but I

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
30 with the three I came with but I
think<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:49.889> depends<00:02:50.099> on<00:02:50.189> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
think it's I think it depends on the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.589 
think it's I think it depends on the
dent<00:02:50.489> -<00:02:50.670> if<00:02:50.849> you've<00:02:51.030> got<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.150> lot<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.359> little

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
dent - if you've got a lot of little

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.020 
dent - if you've got a lot of little
poles<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.620> got<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.889> make<00:02:53.040> versus<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:53.639> big<00:02:53.879> one

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
poles you got to make versus one big one

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.360 
poles you got to make versus one big one
maybe<00:02:54.689> that's<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.139> I<00:02:55.169> don't<00:02:55.349> know<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.250> it's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
maybe that's it I don't know but it's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.740 
maybe that's it I don't know but it's
definitely<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.730> ton<00:02:57.030> better<00:02:57.269> than<00:02:57.389> what<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.599> was

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
definitely a ton better than what it was

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.619 
definitely a ton better than what it was
a<00:02:58.169> lot<00:02:58.769> less<00:02:58.950> noticeable<00:02:59.340> once<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.359> get<00:03:00.480> these

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
a lot less noticeable once I get these

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.949 
a lot less noticeable once I get these
two<00:03:00.840> pulled<00:03:01.079> out<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.260> here<00:03:01.530> then<00:03:01.889> now<00:03:02.959> then

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
two pulled out of here then now then

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.179 
two pulled out of here then now then
I'll<00:03:04.079> go<00:03:04.200> ahead<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:04.560> I'll<00:03:04.650> pan<00:03:04.889> out<00:03:05.069> and

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
I'll go ahead and I'll pan out and

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.699 
I'll go ahead and I'll pan out and
you'll<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.370> able<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.579> see<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.260> let<00:03:07.260> me<00:03:07.379> let<00:03:07.680> me

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
you'll be able to see it let me let me

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.869 
you'll be able to see it let me let me
get<00:03:07.829> these<00:03:07.980> pulled<00:03:08.280> out<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.609> I'll<00:03:08.669> be<00:03:08.700> right

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
get these pulled out and I'll be right

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.369 
get these pulled out and I'll be right
back

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
back

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.629 
back
all<00:03:10.379> right<00:03:10.590> about<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.859> pull<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.040> last<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.489> out

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
all right about to pull the last one out

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.210 
all right about to pull the last one out
the<00:03:12.480> one<00:03:12.599> thing<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.810> wish<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.169> had<00:03:13.379> at<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.919> I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the one thing I wish this had at it is I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.379 
the one thing I wish this had at it is I
wish<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.760> nut<00:03:15.060> was<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.389> little<00:03:15.659> bit<00:03:15.750> quicker

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
wish this nut was a little bit quicker

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.530 
wish this nut was a little bit quicker
in<00:03:18.389> that<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.379> takes<00:03:19.879> even<00:03:20.879> to<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.209> level

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540

blue is just starting to pop up now I
didn't<00:04:05.400> find<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.609> neat<00:04:05.819> little<00:04:05.970> trick<00:04:06.209> though

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449

this<00:04:06.659> stuff's<00:04:06.870> pain<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.229> peel<00:04:07.409> off<00:04:07.639> to<00:04:08.639> give

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
this stuff's pain to peel off to give

this stuff's pain to peel off to give
you<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:08.909> little<00:04:09.120> bottle<00:04:09.419> basically<00:04:09.840> acetone<00:04:12.109> so

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
you a little bottle basically acetone so

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.670 
you a little bottle basically acetone so
there's<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.689> release<00:04:15.959> agent<00:04:16.169> if<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.500> take<00:04:16.650> a

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
there's a release agent if you take a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.219 
there's a release agent if you take a
couple<00:04:17.039> drops<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.519> stuff<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:19.019> just<00:04:21.229> kind

solid<00:05:05.110> end<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.710> much<00:05:06.490> less<00:05:07.210> noticeable

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
solid end to a much less noticeable

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.550 
solid end to a much less noticeable
series<00:05:08.980> of<00:05:09.160> smaller<00:05:09.460> dents<00:05:09.790> so<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.440> might<00:05:11.440> do

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
series of smaller dents so I might do

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.250 
series of smaller dents so I might do
one<00:05:11.710> more<00:05:11.920> pull<00:05:12.130> right<00:05:12.400> there<00:05:13.230> again<00:05:14.230> just

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
one more pull right there again just

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.310 
one more pull right there again just
because<00:05:14.820> but<00:05:15.820> other<00:05:16.000> than<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:16.210> though<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.690> got

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
because but other than that though I got

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.350 
because but other than that though I got
a<00:05:17.350> safer<00:05:17.770> for<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.130> 13<00:05:18.490> bucks<00:05:18.730> I<00:05:18.910> spent<00:05:19.150> on<00:05:19.240> this

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
a safer for the 13 bucks I spent on this

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.750 
a safer for the 13 bucks I spent on this
thing<00:05:19.600> I've<00:05:20.470> been<00:05:20.530> out<00:05:20.770> here<00:05:20.800> how<00:05:21.340> in<00:05:21.460> time<00:05:21.640> it

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
thing I've been out here how in time it

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.980 
thing I've been out here how in time it
is<00:05:21.820> but<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.030> bet<00:05:22.120> are<00:05:22.300> since<00:05:22.510> new<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:22.840> think

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
is but I bet are since new and I think

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.010 
is but I bet are since new and I think
I've<00:05:23.080> been<00:05:23.170> out<00:05:23.260> here<00:05:23.290> about<00:05:24.570> 45<00:05:25.570> minutes

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
I've been out here about 45 minutes

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.340 
I've been out here about 45 minutes
maybe<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:27.450> you<00:05:28.450> know<00:05:28.570> considering<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.110> lot<00:05:29.230> of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
maybe and you know considering a lot of

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.540 
maybe and you know considering a lot of
that<00:05:29.440> time<00:05:29.650> was<00:05:29.860> also<00:05:29.950> waiting<00:05:30.250> for<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.430> glue

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
that time was also waiting for the glue

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.240 
that time was also waiting for the glue
gun<00:05:30.670> to<00:05:30.790> heat<00:05:30.940> up<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:32.140> so<00:05:32.320> forth<00:05:32.680> and

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
gun to heat up and and so forth and

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.860 
gun to heat up and and so forth and
again<00:05:33.580> half<00:05:33.820> of<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.060> is<00:05:34.150> spinning<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.480> nut<00:05:34.720> on

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
again half of it is spinning that nut on

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.630 
again half of it is spinning that nut on
and<00:05:35.080> off<00:05:36.330> yeah<00:05:37.440> I'd<00:05:38.440> give<00:05:38.890> it<00:05:39.010> a<00:05:39.040> four<00:05:39.250> star<00:05:39.460> out

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
and off yeah I'd give it a four star out

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.750 
and off yeah I'd give it a four star out
of<00:05:39.670> five<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:39.970> think<00:05:41.250> like<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.310> said<00:05:42.460> other<00:05:42.550> than<00:05:42.640> a

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
of five I think like I said other than a

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.330 
of five I think like I said other than a
little<00:05:42.880> little<00:05:43.600> things<00:05:43.780> probably<00:05:44.260> both<00:05:44.530> other

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
little little things probably both other

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.600 
little little things probably both other
than<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.580> though<00:05:45.970> like<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.420> said<00:05:46.720> I<00:05:46.750> mean<00:05:46.990> it's

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
than that though like I said I mean it's

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.920 
than that though like I said I mean it's
special<00:05:48.610> when<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.760> stand<00:05:48.970> back<00:05:49.240> having<00:05:49.780> yeah

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
special when you stand back having yeah

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.870 
special when you stand back having yeah
you<00:05:49.990> can<00:05:50.200> see<00:05:50.410> it<00:05:50.530> but<00:05:51.190> it's<00:05:51.310> not<00:05:51.430> nearly<00:05:51.700> as

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
you can see it but it's not nearly as

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.680 
you can see it but it's not nearly as
bad<00:05:52.030> as<00:05:52.090> it<00:05:52.270> was

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
bad as it was

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.740 
bad as it was
so<00:05:53.670> definitely<00:05:54.670> an<00:05:54.760> improvement<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:55.360> like<00:05:55.720> I

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
so definitely an improvement and like I

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.690 
so definitely an improvement and like I
said<00:05:55.960> I'm<00:05:56.080> sure<00:05:56.440> with<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.620> bunch<00:05:56.800> more<00:05:56.860> more

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
said I'm sure with a bunch more more

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.320 
said I'm sure with a bunch more more
small<00:05:57.970> poles

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
small poles

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.940 
small poles
I'll<00:05:59.200> have<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.670> almost<00:06:01.470> you<00:06:02.470> know<00:06:02.560> almost

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
I'll have that almost you know almost

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.070 
I'll have that almost you know almost
like<00:06:03.190> you<00:06:03.370> can<00:06:03.550> see<00:06:03.730> it<00:06:03.850> and<00:06:04.060> that's<00:06:04.840> that's

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
like you can see it and that's that's

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.480 
like you can see it and that's that's
kind<00:06:05.200> of<00:06:05.350> the<00:06:05.440> idea<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.770> think<00:06:05.860> is<00:06:06.160> just<00:06:06.340> a

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
kind of the idea I think is just a

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.310 
kind of the idea I think is just a
madness<00:06:07.450> or<00:06:07.540> they<00:06:07.600> make<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:07.870> perfect<00:06:08.230> but

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
madness or they make it perfect but

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.100 
madness or they make it perfect but
definitely<00:06:08.650> minimize<00:06:08.980> the<00:06:09.160> damage<00:06:09.460> so<00:06:09.960> anyway

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
definitely minimize the damage so anyway

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.130 
definitely minimize the damage so anyway
not<00:06:11.470> too<00:06:11.620> shabby<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.980> good
