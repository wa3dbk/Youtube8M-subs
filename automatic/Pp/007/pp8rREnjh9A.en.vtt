00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
you guys before I started this journey

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.640 
you guys before I started this journey
that<00:00:23.189> could<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.640> cook<00:00:23.910> rice<00:00:24.240> okay<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that could not cook rice okay it just it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
that could not cook rice okay it just it
just<00:00:25.949> wasn't<00:00:26.580> working<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.000> me<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> um<00:00:29.060> yeah

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
just wasn't working for me so um yeah

but<00:00:30.660> anyway<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.320> nothing<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> best

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
but anyway it's nothing I think the best

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540 
but anyway it's nothing I think the best
thing<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> woman<00:00:35.010> meets<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> god

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
thing is when a woman meets the god

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.250 
thing is when a woman meets the god
she's<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.180> trying<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.960> him

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950 
she's really trying to get to know him
and<00:00:37.500> instead<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.629> dinner<00:00:39.780> she

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
and instead of going out for dinner she
cooks<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.620> him<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.790> is
