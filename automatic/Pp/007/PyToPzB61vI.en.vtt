00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.549
 very good welcome to me you are 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.799
 dotcom today in this video I bring you 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.360
 this look that I'm wearing and that I'm going to 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.119
 put here for you to see more of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.250
 close is a smoky toned 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.840
 purple and the idea that I have with this 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.550
 tutorial is to teach you that we can 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.349
 use all the dark ones in our 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.750
 eyes without dwarfing or without visually 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.059
 make our eyes smaller is a 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.680
 very soft tuxedo is nothing ornate 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.970
 so for those who are not very 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.500
 used to make up you can 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.660
 start trying out this kind of looks a 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.210
 little bit stronger before trying with 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.399
 a black tuxedo or a smoked really 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.140
 loaded let's start the tutorial 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.450
 you are going to see the products that I will go 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 using throughout the tutorial 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.800
 on the screen and nothing else we started 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 good girls we started with the base of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 shadows that we always use because 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 you know that it helps us that the duration 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.330
 of shade and pigmentation increase 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.250
 the most intense as well as the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.960
 shadows are best obtained on the basis 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.960
 It is easier to work with them 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.380
 to base color mode we will use 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.030
 a shade in a warm lilac shade and the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.119
 we are going to put all the eyelid mobile 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.119
 ah 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.010
 now to create the smoky effect 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.900
 we will be creating intensity but little to 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.940
 little we will go putting little product 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.610
 every time giving more intensity if the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.530
 we will use a bevelled brush and a shadow 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.990
 abode that have good pigmentation and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.700
 that is quite dark and what is not 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.830
 we want is in small to make the eye 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.690
 we have to keep the dark in the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.790
 two thirds outside and we have to 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.480
 blur diagonally 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.440
 and 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.370
 i 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 precisely for that to help the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.360
 transition now let's use a brush 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.010
 pencil type that allows us to work with 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.380
 more precisely a brush 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.330
 blur and we're just going to take shade 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.610
 but let's mark the base of the smoked 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.940
 and we are going to blur it well 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.940
 Y 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.019
 Y 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.330
 to perfect the outer edges 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.400
 we will use a brush of 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.900
 blur that is well dense and we 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.230
 we will help from a shadow in a tone 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 natural 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.319
 ah 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.590
 Y 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.660
 we go back to the bevelled brush and put the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.990
 dark shadow darker in the corner 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.510
 of the lower eyelid 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.480
 and to blur the stroke we will use the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.790
 purple shadow lighter 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.739
 to finish we will illuminate the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.250
 tear integrated into the brightness with 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.250
 makeup rest 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.200
 another trick so that the eye did not know more 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.390
 small when we use shadows 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.520
 dark is to use for example a pencil in 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.470
 beige tones on the water line this 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.910
 will open the eye and clear it for 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.530
 bring a little more volume to the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.420
 tabs that what we're going to do with the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.790
 Mascara we will use a brush 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.770
 beveled and a black shadow and we're going to 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.900
 put to touch as close as possible to 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.910
 the base of the upper lashes now 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.290
 yes we go with the tabs to get 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.560
 more volume we will do it in three stages 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.390
 first a base we're just going to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040
 use at the root at the base of the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.200
 eyelashes and always with movements in 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.490
 zig-zag you are not on the tip of the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.710
 eyelashes because this will make it 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.630
 cake now we move to the mask 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.610
 we repeat the zig movement again 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.380
 zag and insisting on the base leading 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.730
 towards the tips only the residue that 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.340
 we stayed in the brush but never 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.110
 we load the lupillo or apply it 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.730
 directly on the tips because 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.970
 they're going to permeate us and it's not what 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.970
 we want 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.640
 to finish giving volume we use a 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.560
 top coat and guess incide in the base 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.159
 and just at the tips with movements 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.159
 in zig zag 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.740
 Y 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.210
 we go to the eyebrows that you know is 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.750
 essential you already have a whole video 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.750
 about them 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.930
 for the skin we are going to put the base in 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.630
 specific areas and then we fade 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.430
 those areas with a makeup brush 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.810
 this is especially useful when not 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.490
 you have too many imperfections and 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.249
 you simply want to unify the tone of 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.789
 your skin 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.789
 ah 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.690
 Y 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.590
 Y 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.180
 i 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.750
 Y 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.750
 Y 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.320
 i 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.300
 to contour we will use a brush 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.340
 beveled and we will be adding intensity 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.990
 little by little we will know when we have 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.250
 to stop and we will not see the cheeks 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.250
 too much make-up by mistake 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.830
 Y 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.570
 Y 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.120
 as we continue with the tonalities 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.010
 warm we use a blusher that has a 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.000
 powdery pink tone with a base 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.470
 quality 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.120
 and the same shadow that we used 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.640
 for the lacrimal we will use it 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.400
 also to illuminate the cheeks the 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.690
 tip of the nose and the arch of the eyebrow 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.490
 this mark by the way has discovered him 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.350
 very recently and although his name 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.790
 it squeaks because I hate the words 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.290
 Written badly, even by license 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.180
 artistic so to speak it would squeak me 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.180
 but hey the waves are very good 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.520
 Y 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.110
 ah 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.940
 and finally with the lips too 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.980
 we continue with the warm tones I will 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.510
 put the lipstick to touch and blur it 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.870
 with your finger so that it integrates well with 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.870
 the skin 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.590
 and as a final touch it gives more volume with a 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.590
 blues 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.530
 and now it's our turn to 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.030
 recreate the look and do not doubt 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.800
 in sending me your photos or of 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.450

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.060
 social will install facebook you can

 that comes as always two videos but 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.590
 we change the schedules again I do not 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.810
 you kill Tuesday and Friday there will be video 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.700
 there will be entry into my dotcom oysters as well 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.860
 It gives me a little more time to edit 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.740
 and prepare the tickets between day and 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.930
 day and I keep nothing else from the 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.280
 next week, Tuesday and Friday, 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.870
 from it then to infinity 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.870
 because beyond a little kiss 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.870
 or
