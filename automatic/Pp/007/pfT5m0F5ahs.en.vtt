00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
ok so here we go so this is the filled

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
changes also distortion as you move it

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
changes also distortion as you move it
slightly<00:00:19.529> higher<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:25.039> can<00:00:26.039> change<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.789> type

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
slightly higher up can change the type

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.870 
slightly higher up can change the type
of<00:00:27.060> base<00:00:30.260> by<00:00:31.260> pressing<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.430> button<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
of base by pressing the button with the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.630 
of base by pressing the button with the
four<00:00:33.380> circles<00:00:34.380> Japan<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> these<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> four

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
four circles Japan so these are the four

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
four circles Japan so these are the four
types<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.120> bases<00:00:39.540> such<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> moment<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
types of bases such at the moment I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
types of bases such at the moment I
haven't<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.850> phone<00:00:42.090> plugged<00:00:42.540> into<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
haven't got the phone plugged into the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
haven't got the phone plugged into the
camera<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> won't<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> hear<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
camera so you won't go out to hear the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.920 
camera so you won't go out to hear the
7s<00:00:47.090> but<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.510> happens<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
7s but this is what happens when the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.700 
7s but this is what happens when the
bestest

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.580 

and<00:00:57.070> each<00:00:58.070> one<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.370> these<00:00:58.520> buttons

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
and each one of these buttons

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.639 
and each one of these buttons
corresponds<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.040> saved<00:01:01.989> space<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.440> if<00:01:03.500> you

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
corresponds to the saved space so if you

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.770 
corresponds to the saved space so if you
go<00:01:03.800> back<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.190> first<00:01:04.400> base<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:08.330> massage<00:01:08.750> it

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
go back to the first base and massage it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.820 
go back to the first base and massage it
by<00:01:09.050> pressing<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.970> Aspern<00:01:14.140> now<00:01:15.140> playing<00:01:15.500> this

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
by pressing the Aspern now playing this

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.260 
by pressing the Aspern now playing this
church<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:17.440> can<00:01:18.440> then<00:01:18.590> go<00:01:18.880> distinct<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:22.270> sticky

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
church I can then go distinct one sticky

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.160 
church I can then go distinct one sticky
side<00:01:23.800> so<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:25.100> now<00:01:25.280> plays<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.729> sound<00:01:26.170> so

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
side so that now plays this sound so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:46.680 
side so that now plays this sound so
good<00:01:32.770> okay<00:01:42.429> let's<00:01:43.750> make<00:01:44.750> some<00:01:45.080> beats<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.619> well

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
good okay let's make some beats as well

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.740 
good okay let's make some beats as well
put<00:01:47.690> some<00:01:47.840> bass<00:01:48.050> over<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> beach<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:53.539> maybe

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
put some bass over the beach to maybe

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:09.069 
put some bass over the beach to maybe
choose<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.350> dropping<00:01:54.770> out<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.340> loop<00:02:08.079> so

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
choose to dropping out of the loop so

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.509 
choose to dropping out of the loop so
each<00:02:09.259> one<00:02:09.290> of<00:02:09.470> those<00:02:09.590> bases<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.220> we<00:02:10.310> chose

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
each one of those bases that we chose

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.840 
each one of those bases that we chose
earlier<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:11.269> corresponding<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.579> base<00:02:13.579> 1

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
earlier is now corresponding to base 1

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.890 
earlier is now corresponding to base 1
space<00:02:14.720> 2<00:02:15.250> phase<00:02:16.250> 3<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.970> phase<00:02:17.060> 4<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.510> consume

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
space 2 phase 3 and phase 4 so I consume

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.160 
space 2 phase 3 and phase 4 so I consume
these<00:02:21.079> bases<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.799> jump<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:23.140> make<00:02:24.140> a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
these bases to the jump it now make a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.660 
these bases to the jump it now make a
little<00:02:24.470> melody<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.709> I'm<00:02:27.769> going<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.040> back<00:02:28.070> to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
little melody so I'm going to go back to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.340 
little melody so I'm going to go back to
the<00:02:28.700> water<00:02:28.970> page<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:31.690> find<00:02:32.690> some<00:02:33.049> suitable

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
the water page and find some suitable

00:02:33.350 --> 00:03:00.390 
the water page and find some suitable
pitches

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:19.120 

so<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:02.420> also<00:03:02.600> got<00:03:02.900> multi-touch<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:18.950> can

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
so this also got multi-touch so you can

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.740 
so this also got multi-touch so you can
have<00:03:19.280> up<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.400> six<00:03:19.700> with<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.000> sound<00:03:20.330> playing

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
have up to six with the sound playing

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:37.830 
have up to six with the sound playing
any<00:03:21.080> one<00:03:21.290> time<00:03:21.530> if<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.890> give<00:03:22.070> your<00:03:22.280> fingers

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.960 

I'm<00:03:38.840> do<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.230> little<00:03:39.500> bit<00:03:39.650> more<00:03:39.800> practice<00:03:40.040> hang

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
I'm do the little bit more practice hang

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.160 
I'm do the little bit more practice hang
on<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:45.130> then<00:03:46.130> obviously<00:03:47.170> social

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
on to that and then obviously social

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.670 
on to that and then obviously social
effects<00:03:49.120> yet<00:03:50.120> there<00:03:50.240> these<00:03:50.840> effects<00:03:51.230> with<00:03:51.500> the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
effects yet there these effects with the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.210 
effects yet there these effects with the
the<00:03:52.280> next<00:03:52.580> update<00:03:52.790> as<00:03:53.210> well<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:54.500> as<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:54.890> nice

and<00:04:17.920> there<00:04:18.100> we<00:04:18.220> go<00:04:18.480> what<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.600> base<00:04:19.780> station

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
and there we go what the base station

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.829 
and there we go what the base station
for<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.440> iphone
