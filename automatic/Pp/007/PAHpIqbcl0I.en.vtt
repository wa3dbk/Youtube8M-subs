00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.350 
tried it a couple times and I was sold
on<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.820> had<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.149> my<00:01:27.299> own

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
on it you know and I had to get my own

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:38.960 
on it you know and I had to get my own
stuff<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.190 

kind<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.119> cool<00:01:40.330> thing<00:01:40.540> about<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.990> it's

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
kind of the cool thing about it it's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.289 
kind of the cool thing about it it's
like<00:01:41.500> if<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.920> training<00:01:42.189> tool<00:01:42.580> put<00:01:42.880> it's<00:01:43.030> fun

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
like if the training tool put it's fun

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.469 
like if the training tool put it's fun
so<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:43.960> guess<00:01:44.680> every<00:01:45.549> time<00:01:45.759> I'm<00:01:45.880> on<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.210> I'm<00:01:46.330> just

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
so I guess every time I'm on it I'm just

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.100 
so I guess every time I'm on it I'm just
using<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.960> as<00:01:47.079> both<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.590> know<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.990> know

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
using it as both you know and you know

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.679 
using it as both you know and you know
there's<00:01:50.350> times<00:01:50.649> when<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.520> know<00:01:52.090> I'll<00:01:52.299> do<00:01:52.509> like

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
there's times when you know I'll do like

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.810 
there's times when you know I'll do like
a<00:01:52.750> longer<00:01:53.229> race<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.830> stuff<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:54.340> maybe<00:01:54.610> I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
a longer race and stuff and maybe I'm

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.600

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.050 
tired or maybe I don't have other things
to<00:01:57.759> do<00:01:57.939> but<00:01:58.689> it's<00:01:59.280> it's<00:02:00.280> good<00:02:00.549> it's<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.939> good

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and you know I guess that just kind of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.870 
and you know I guess that just kind of
came<00:02:28.510> about<00:02:28.690> from<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.980> know<00:02:30.099> sometimes<00:02:30.610> you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
came about from you know sometimes you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.140 
came about from you know sometimes you
can<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:31.120> be<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> supporter<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.319> product<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
if you really do believe in it I think

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.410
