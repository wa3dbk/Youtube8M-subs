was<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.060> Z<00:00:07.049> rest<00:00:07.290> over<00:00:07.529> there<00:00:08.030> you<00:00:09.030> know<00:00:09.120> you

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
was the Z rest over there you know you

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.230 
was the Z rest over there you know you
can't<00:00:09.599> beat<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.320> foams<00:00:10.590> arrest<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.849> it's

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
can't beat the foams arrest for it's

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.180 
can't beat the foams arrest for it's
just<00:00:12.660> bulletproof<00:00:13.200> miss<00:00:13.440> there's<00:00:13.740> nothing<00:00:14.070> to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
just bulletproof miss there's nothing to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400 
just bulletproof miss there's nothing to
go<00:00:14.309> wrong<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:15.269> can<00:00:15.420> cut<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.750> down<00:00:15.870> if<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.230> want

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
go wrong you can cut it down if you want

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.680 
go wrong you can cut it down if you want
to<00:00:17.279> save<00:00:17.490> weight<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.970> could<00:00:18.090> cut<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.330> down<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to save weight you could cut it down to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.769 
to save weight you could cut it down to
make<00:00:18.930> sitting<00:00:19.350> pads<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
make sitting pads and you know it's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.349 
make sitting pads and you know it's
ready<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.170> go<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.380> don't<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.210> inflate<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
ready to go you don't have to inflate it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480 
ready to go you don't have to inflate it
full<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.600> air<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.170> mean<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.099> pretty<00:00:26.340> much

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
full of air I mean it's it's pretty much

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.179 
full of air I mean it's it's pretty much
other<00:00:26.789> than<00:00:26.910> its<00:00:28.760> space<00:00:29.760> its<00:00:30.119> bulk<00:00:31.189> there

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
other than its space its bulk there

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.920 
other than its space its bulk there
really<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.730> no<00:00:32.759> reason<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> Z

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
really is no reason to go with the Z

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.670 
really is no reason to go with the Z
rest<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:35.930> originally<00:00:36.930> got<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
rest and I originally got it because I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
rest and I originally got it because I
was<00:00:37.829> rolling<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.879> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.780> dual

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
was rolling with them kind of dual

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
was rolling with them kind of dual
system<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> winter<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.430> went<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
system in the winter I went to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.830 
system in the winter I went to
previously<00:00:42.450> had<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> lighter<00:00:42.930> pad<00:00:44.600> let's<00:00:45.600> see

previously had a lighter pad let's see

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.819 
previously had a lighter pad let's see
the<00:00:46.350> Z<00:00:46.649> rest<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.190> 14<00:00:47.969> ounces<00:00:48.390> oh<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.649> that's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the Z rest is 14 ounces oh that's that's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.709 
the Z rest is 14 ounces oh that's that's
pretty<00:00:50.010> good<00:00:51.949> let's<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.090> aria<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pretty good let's see here the aria is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
pretty good let's see here the aria is
short<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:56.160> I've<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.149> can

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
short which I've got right there you can

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
short which I've got right there you can
see<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> pretty<00:00:58.350> small<00:00:58.469> little<00:00:58.800> package<00:00:59.449> but

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
see is a pretty small little package but

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.130 
see is a pretty small little package but
even<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> 15<00:01:01.739> ounces<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
even that one is 15 ounces you know in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990 
even that one is 15 ounces you know in
15<00:01:04.260> ounces<00:01:04.769> isn't<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> whole<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.760> just

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
15 ounces isn't a whole lot it's just

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.560 
15 ounces isn't a whole lot it's just
under<00:01:06.150> pound<00:01:06.799> but<00:01:07.799> again<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
under pound but again this one is not a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.670 
under pound but again this one is not a
full<00:01:09.840> length<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.710> only<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> short<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.680> which

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
full length it is only a short and which

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
full length it is only a short and which
means<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.010> feet<00:01:14.159> will<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.340> exposed<00:01:15.320> you're

means your feet will be exposed you're

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
means your feet will be exposed you're
getting<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> light<00:01:17.130> weight

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
getting a little bit of light weight

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.210 
getting a little bit of light weight
pneus<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> half<00:01:18.409> inch<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.770> has

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pneus it's a one and a half inch it has

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
pneus it's a one and a half inch it has
a<00:01:20.250> foam<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.720> fill<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.020> air<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a foam and it is fill with air so you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.350 
a foam and it is fill with air so you
know<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> still<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.150> foam

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
know you still have a little bit of foam

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.010 
know you still have a little bit of foam
insulation<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.369> if<00:01:26.369> need<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.509> it's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
insulation in there if need be but it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.539 
insulation in there if need be but it's
self<00:01:28.290> inflating<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:29.070> where<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.280> foam

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
self inflating that's where that foam

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.920 
self inflating that's where that foam
comes<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> push<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> air<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
comes in you push all the air out of the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
comes in you push all the air out of the
foam<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.400> close<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> valve<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
foam and close the valve off and it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
foam and close the valve off and it
seals<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.930> once<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> open<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> Valve<00:01:34.799> all

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
seals it once you open that Valve all

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.020 
seals it once you open that Valve all
the<00:01:35.130> air<00:01:35.280> goes<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.850> foam<00:01:36.060> wants<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the air goes in the foam wants to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.190 
the air goes in the foam wants to
reinforce<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.329> inflate<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> with

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
reinforce it there and inflate it with

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.580 
reinforce it there and inflate it with
your<00:01:40.320> mouth<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.970> where<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.210> big<00:01:42.659> agnes<00:01:42.899> you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.490 
natural shelters then what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> Z<00:01:57.719> rest<00:01:57.960> strapped<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I'll have the Z rest strapped to the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.639 
I'll have the Z rest strapped to the
outside<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.979> I'll<00:01:59.399> put<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.610> underneath

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
outside and I'll put that underneath

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.090 
outside and I'll put that underneath
this<00:02:01.649> especially<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.399> i'm<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:04.100> big

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
this especially if i'm using the big

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.510 
this especially if i'm using the big
agnes<00:02:05.340> sleeping<00:02:06.329> bag<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.039> pad<00:02:08.310> will

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
agnes sleeping bag because this pad will

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.699 
agnes sleeping bag because this pad will
be<00:02:08.640> inside<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.270> sleeve<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.869> bag<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.410> so

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
be inside that sleeve of the bag and so

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.559 
be inside that sleeve of the bag and so
to<00:02:10.770> add<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.400> protection<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.239> add<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
to add a little protection and add the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.890 
to add a little protection and add the
moisture<00:02:12.989> wicking<00:02:13.200> from

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
moisture wicking from

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.229 
moisture wicking from
no<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.230> stuff<00:02:14.439> i<00:02:15.159> will<00:02:15.549> put<00:02:15.700> down<00:02:15.909> instead<00:02:16.180> of

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
no and stuff i will put down instead of

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.229 
no and stuff i will put down instead of
just<00:02:16.420> using<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.739> piece<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.519> tyvek<00:02:19.030> or

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
just using it like a piece of tyvek or

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.089 
just using it like a piece of tyvek or
tarp<00:02:19.510> or<00:02:19.720> something<00:02:20.049> I'll<00:02:20.439> just<00:02:20.650> carry<00:02:20.860> this

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
tarp or something I'll just carry this

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.440 
tarp or something I'll just carry this
with<00:02:21.280> me<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.790> adds<00:02:21.939> a<00:02:22.090> little<00:02:22.150> bit<00:02:22.299> more

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
with me and it adds a little bit more

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.280 
with me and it adds a little bit more
insulation<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:24.099> two<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> half<00:02:24.519> is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
insulation the two and a half is

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.380 
insulation the two and a half is
insulated<00:02:26.290> however<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.670> Big<00:02:27.819> Agnes<00:02:28.000> does

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
insulated however the Big Agnes does

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.839 
insulated however the Big Agnes does
have<00:02:28.689> I<00:02:29.230> believe<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:29.860> primaloft<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.609> its

they do have a down insulated one for

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.429 
they do have a down insulated one for
winter<00:02:58.540> camping<00:03:00.569> they<00:03:01.569> have<00:03:01.840> gotten<00:03:02.079> around

winter camping they have gotten around

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.089 
winter camping they have gotten around
the<00:03:04.109> reason<00:03:05.109> for<00:03:05.290> down<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.650> would<00:03:05.769> not<00:03:05.889> want

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
the reason for down you would not want

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.229 
the reason for down you would not want
to<00:03:06.159> add<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.549> moisture<00:03:06.909> out<00:03:06.939> of<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:07.180> breath

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239

you<00:03:10.239> have<00:03:10.359> quite<00:03:10.599> a<00:03:10.659> bit<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.870> moisture<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.260> your

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
you have quite a bit of moisture in your

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.220 
you have quite a bit of moisture in your
lungs<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:13.000> perspire<00:03:13.569> out<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:14.139> you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
lungs that you perspire out when you

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.990 
lungs that you perspire out when you
breathe<00:03:14.470> out<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.489> if<00:03:15.639> you're<00:03:15.760> trying<00:03:15.909> to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
breathe out and so if you're trying to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.809 
breathe out and so if you're trying to
fill<00:03:16.180> up<00:03:16.299> a<00:03:16.389> pad<00:03:17.250> remember<00:03:18.250> all<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.400> moisture

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
fill up a pad remember all that moisture

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.250 
fill up a pad remember all that moisture
is<00:03:18.879> going<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.090> get<00:03:19.209> trapped<00:03:19.569> in<00:03:19.810> there<00:03:19.989> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
is going to get trapped in there and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.379 
is going to get trapped in there and
went<00:03:20.680> down<00:03:20.949> not<00:03:21.639> only<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.000> going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.269> be<00:03:22.359> a

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
went down not only is it going to be a

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.879 
went down not only is it going to be a
particularly<00:03:22.810> bad<00:03:22.989> for<00:03:23.290> down<00:03:23.440> because<00:03:23.739> it's

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
particularly bad for down because it's

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:24.990 
particularly bad for down because it's
going<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.099> get<00:03:24.190> moist<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:24.669> going<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.849> lose

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
going to get moist it's going to lose

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.449 
going to get moist it's going to lose
its<00:03:25.209> loft<00:03:25.449> its<00:03:25.690> insulation<00:03:26.079> but<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.859> in<00:03:27.129> the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
its loft its insulation but you in the

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.979 
its loft its insulation but you in the
winter<00:03:27.730> when<00:03:27.849> it's<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.180> cold<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.720> do<00:03:28.840> not

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
winter when it's that cold you do not

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.599 
winter when it's that cold you do not
want<00:03:29.260> water<00:03:29.949> it's<00:03:30.609> stuck<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.090> your<00:03:31.180> pad<00:03:32.609> so

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
want water it's stuck in your pad so

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.580 
want water it's stuck in your pad so
what<00:03:33.849> they<00:03:33.970> do<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.209> they<00:03:34.510> actually<00:03:34.629> have<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.379> way

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
what they do is they actually have a way

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.939 
what they do is they actually have a way
of<00:03:35.859> taking<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.489> stuff<00:03:36.940> sack<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.769> hooking<00:03:38.769> it

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
of taking the stuff sack and hooking it

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.289 
of taking the stuff sack and hooking it
up<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.129> that<00:03:39.250> valve<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.879> you<00:03:40.000> essentially

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
up to that valve and you essentially

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.659 
up to that valve and you essentially
just<00:03:40.540> fill<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.840> full<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.049> air<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.530> then<00:03:41.680> squish

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
just fill it full of air and then squish

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.819 
just fill it full of air and then squish
the<00:03:42.909> air<00:03:43.060> out<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.659> that's<00:03:44.019> how<00:03:44.169> you<00:03:44.290> inflate

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
the air out and that's how you inflate

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.250 
the air out and that's how you inflate
the<00:03:45.099> down<00:03:45.280> one<00:03:45.549> now<00:03:46.030> as<00:03:46.419> weird<00:03:46.989> as<00:03:47.109> that<00:03:47.139> sounds

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
the down one now as weird as that sounds

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.500 
the down one now as weird as that sounds
it<00:03:47.799> doesn't<00:03:48.190> take<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.459> long<00:03:48.669> to<00:03:48.909> fill<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.419> up

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
it doesn't take that long to fill it up

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.460 
it doesn't take that long to fill it up
I<00:03:49.750> believe<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.590> did<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:50.949> five<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.489> six<00:03:52.470> puffs

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
I believe I did it in five to six puffs

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.119 
I believe I did it in five to six puffs
of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:54.879> sack<00:03:55.199> the<00:03:56.199> sack<00:03:56.560> worked<00:03:56.979> pretty

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
of the the sack the sack worked pretty

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.729 
of the the sack the sack worked pretty
good<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:58.299> that<00:03:58.540> way<00:03:58.659> it<00:03:58.780> keeps<00:03:58.930> here<00:03:59.229> they<00:03:59.560> get

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
good but that way it keeps here they get

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.909 
good but that way it keeps here they get
around<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.250> for<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.479> think<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.079> maybe<00:04:02.229> touch<00:04:02.620> bit

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
around it for I think it maybe touch bit

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.170 
around it for I think it maybe touch bit
lighter<00:04:03.159> it's<00:04:03.519> probably<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.819> little<00:04:03.879> bit<00:04:04.030> more

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
lighter it's probably a little bit more

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.180 
lighter it's probably a little bit more
expensive<00:04:04.449> but<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:05.409> your<00:04:05.530> down<00:04:05.709> guys<00:04:05.949> out

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
expensive but for your down guys out

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.770 
expensive but for your down guys out
there<00:04:06.400> they<00:04:06.549> do<00:04:06.609> have<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.819> down<00:04:07.060> insulated<00:04:07.510> one

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
there they do have a down insulated one

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.039 
there they do have a down insulated one
and<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:08.919> they<00:04:09.159> get<00:04:09.250> around<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.639> breath

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
and so they get around the breath

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.689 
and so they get around the breath
moisture<00:04:11.049> problem<00:04:11.470> by<00:04:12.250> using<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.699> sack<00:04:13.799> as<00:04:14.799> an

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
moisture problem by using the sack as an

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.039 
moisture problem by using the sack as an
inflation<00:04:16.299> tool<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.760> however<00:04:18.940> is<00:04:19.150> 24<00:04:19.659> ounces

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
inflation tool that however is 24 ounces

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.830 
inflation tool that however is 24 ounces
so<00:04:20.919> you've<00:04:21.039> got<00:04:21.070> 14<00:04:21.849> ounces<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.419> that's<00:04:22.599> still

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
so you've got 14 ounces and that's still

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.839 
so you've got 14 ounces and that's still
full<00:04:23.110> size<00:04:23.349> which<00:04:24.130> means<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.490> can<00:04:24.639> cut<00:04:24.820> it

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
full size which means you can cut it

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.500 
full size which means you can cut it
down<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.389> get<00:04:25.479> even<00:04:25.599> less

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
down and get even less

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.630 
down and get even less
if<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.410> go<00:04:27.530> some<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.950> ultra<00:04:28.130> white<00:04:28.250> light

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
if you go some of the ultra white light

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.000 
if you go some of the ultra white light
bags<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:29.840> actually<00:04:30.080> use<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.440> stiff

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
bags you can actually use that stiff

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.110 
bags you can actually use that stiff
foam<00:04:31.340> as<00:04:31.640> a<00:04:32.290> support<00:04:33.290> for<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.620> bag<00:04:33.910> inside<00:04:34.910> of

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
foam as a support for the bag inside of

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.760 
foam as a support for the bag inside of
it<00:04:35.240> or<00:04:35.390> in<00:04:35.570> this<00:04:35.720> stuff<00:04:36.050> sack<00:04:36.320> stuff<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.740> that

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
it or in this stuff sack stuff like that

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.940 
it or in this stuff sack stuff like that
it's<00:04:37.100> pretty<00:04:37.370> versatile<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.440> you've<00:04:39.650> got<00:04:39.860> an

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
it's pretty versatile so you've got an

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.860 
it's pretty versatile so you've got an
ounce<00:04:40.130> slider<00:04:40.460> with<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.760> full<00:04:40.940> size<00:04:41.210> that

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
ounce slider with the full size that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.130 
ounce slider with the full size that
guys<00:04:42.110> at<00:04:42.350> 15<00:04:42.710> ounces<00:04:43.040> was<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> light<00:04:43.520> core<00:04:44.140> you

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
guys at 15 ounces was a light core you

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.900 
guys at 15 ounces was a light core you
know<00:04:45.230> it's<00:04:45.410> not<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.590> full-size<00:04:46.010> pad<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.580> then

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
know it's not a full-size pad and then

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.290 
know it's not a full-size pad and then
the<00:04:47.030> full-size<00:04:47.450> this<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> square<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:49.490> mummy

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
the full-size this is a square a mummy

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.780 
the full-size this is a square a mummy
it<00:04:51.080> goes<00:04:51.200> inside<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.620> big<00:04:51.830> agnes<00:04:52.010> bag<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.670> the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
it goes inside the big agnes bag is the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.650 
it goes inside the big agnes bag is the
reason<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.120> got<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.420> but<00:04:53.710> 24<00:04:54.710> ounces<00:04:55.100> so<00:04:55.660> you

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
reason it got it but 24 ounces so you

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.660 
reason it got it but 24 ounces so you
can<00:04:56.840> see<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.020> 24<00:04:57.530> ounces<00:04:57.920> doesn't<00:04:58.490> look<00:04:58.640> that

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
can see that 24 ounces doesn't look that

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.000 
can see that 24 ounces doesn't look that
bad<00:04:59.030> for<00:04:59.450> bulk<00:04:59.720> but<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.590> know<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:00.740> got<00:05:00.980> to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
bad for bulk but you know you got to

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.320 
bad for bulk but you know you got to
find<00:05:01.250> out<00:05:01.370> whether<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.670> want<00:05:01.850> bulk<00:05:02.090> or<00:05:02.300> weight

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
find out whether you want bulk or weight

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.290 
find out whether you want bulk or weight
and<00:05:02.720> where<00:05:03.320> it's<00:05:03.440> going<00:05:03.500> on<00:05:03.800> your<00:05:03.950> bag<00:05:04.300> again

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
and where it's going on your bag again

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.180 
and where it's going on your bag again
like<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.570> said<00:05:05.600> in<00:05:05.870> my<00:05:05.900> night<00:05:06.140> hike<00:05:06.350> video<00:05:06.680> you

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
like I said in my night hike video you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.530 
like I said in my night hike video you
know<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.310> don't<00:05:07.400> worry<00:05:07.670> about<00:05:07.850> strapping<00:05:08.210> that

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
know I don't worry about strapping that

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.820 
know I don't worry about strapping that
to<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.900> outside<00:05:09.230> of<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.380> pack<00:05:09.560> because

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
to the outside of the pack because

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.250 
to the outside of the pack because
nothing<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.640> get<00:05:10.850> harmed<00:05:11.240> wear<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:11.960> I

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
nothing in get harmed wear this I

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.080 
nothing in get harmed wear this I
wouldn't<00:05:12.830> strap<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.340> outside<00:05:13.670> I'd<00:05:13.850> want

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
wouldn't strap that the outside I'd want

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.900 
wouldn't strap that the outside I'd want
to<00:05:14.150> have<00:05:14.270> an<00:05:14.390> inside<00:05:14.800> protected<00:05:15.800> I<00:05:16.100> probably

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
to have an inside protected I probably

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.210 
to have an inside protected I probably
want<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.270> be<00:05:17.390> using<00:05:17.690> a<00:05:17.780> tent<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.680> that<00:05:18.830> on<00:05:18.920> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
want to be using a tent so that on the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.800 
want to be using a tent so that on the
ground<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:19.670> I<00:05:19.700> don't<00:05:19.850> worry<00:05:20.060> about<00:05:20.240> punctures

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
ground so I don't worry about punctures

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.990 
ground so I don't worry about punctures
both<00:05:21.590> those<00:05:21.770> bags<00:05:21.980> do<00:05:22.220> have<00:05:22.400> repair<00:05:22.730> kits

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
both those bags do have repair kits

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.520 
both those bags do have repair kits
inside<00:05:23.360> of<00:05:23.510> them<00:05:23.630> in<00:05:23.780> case<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.140> do<00:05:24.320> get<00:05:24.470> a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
inside of them in case you do get a

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.700 
inside of them in case you do get a
puncture<00:05:24.770> again<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.700> adds<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.180> weight

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
puncture again that adds to the weight

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.970 
puncture again that adds to the weight
so<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:28.250> know<00:05:28.370> find<00:05:29.030> out<00:05:29.180> what<00:05:29.960> what<00:05:30.440> works<00:05:30.770> for

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
so you know find out what what works for

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.210 
so you know find out what what works for
you<00:05:31.130> essentially<00:05:32.470> just<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.560> compare<00:05:33.980> that

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
you essentially just to compare that

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.870 
you essentially just to compare that
little<00:05:35.560> well<00:05:36.560> let's<00:05:36.710> do<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:36.980> one<00:05:37.040> that

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
little well let's do that one that

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.190 
little well let's do that one that
little<00:05:38.090> guy<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.450> actually<00:05:38.600> four<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.140> half

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
little guy is actually four and a half

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.230 
little guy is actually four and a half
inches<00:05:39.520> by<00:05:40.520> 10<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.450> half<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:43.850> know<00:05:43.970> that's

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
inches by 10 and a half you know that's

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.510 
inches by 10 and a half you know that's
the<00:05:44.450> size<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.900> packs<00:05:45.170> down<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.440> Big<00:05:46.340> Agnes

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
the size that packs down to Big Agnes

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.820 
the size that packs down to Big Agnes
looks<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.180> little<00:05:47.330> bit<00:05:47.510> bigger<00:05:47.690> but<00:05:48.440> depending

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
looks a little bit bigger but depending

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.740 
looks a little bit bigger but depending
on<00:05:48.920> how<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.130> fold<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.700> down<00:05:49.910> it<00:05:50.330> is<00:05:50.600> actually

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
on how you fold it down it is actually

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.960 
on how you fold it down it is actually
only<00:05:51.020> four<00:05:51.350> by<00:05:51.500> eight<00:05:51.770> it<00:05:52.370> looks<00:05:52.580> a<00:05:52.670> little<00:05:52.790> bit

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
only four by eight it looks a little bit

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.040 
only four by eight it looks a little bit
bigger<00:05:53.150> there<00:05:53.360> because<00:05:53.660> it's<00:05:53.810> sort<00:05:53.990> of

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
bigger there because it's sort of

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.260 
bigger there because it's sort of
uncoiled<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.830> that<00:05:54.980> bag<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:55.790> could<00:05:55.940> get<00:05:56.120> it

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
uncoiled in that bag you could get it

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.550 
uncoiled in that bag you could get it
tighter<00:05:56.510> wrap<00:05:56.810> than<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.410> it<00:05:57.500> will

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
tighter wrap than that and it will

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.840 
tighter wrap than that and it will
actually<00:05:57.740> come<00:05:58.040> out<00:05:58.070> just<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.640> little<00:05:58.670> bit

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
actually come out just a little bit

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.400 
actually come out just a little bit
smaller<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.810> reason<00:06:00.050> for<00:06:00.080> that<00:06:00.200> is

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
smaller and the reason for that is

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.500 
smaller and the reason for that is
doesn't<00:06:00.650> have<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.830> foam<00:06:01.040> inside<00:06:01.460> this<00:06:02.240> still

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
doesn't have the foam inside this still

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.360 
doesn't have the foam inside this still
has<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.870> bulk<00:06:03.080> of<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.350> foam<00:06:03.560> inside<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.190> cell

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
has the bulk of the foam inside the cell

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.920 
has the bulk of the foam inside the cell
phone<00:06:04.520> plating<00:06:04.880> bag<00:06:05.030> so<00:06:05.570> that<00:06:05.600> will<00:06:05.810> actually

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
phone plating bag so that will actually

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.030 
phone plating bag so that will actually
get<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.170> little<00:06:06.380> bit<00:06:06.470> smaller<00:06:06.710> you<00:06:06.860> give<00:06:06.950> it

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
get a little bit smaller you give it

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.400 
get a little bit smaller you give it
four<00:06:07.220> by<00:06:07.340> eight<00:06:07.550> pack<00:06:07.910> size<00:06:08.180> but<00:06:08.870> with<00:06:09.230> this

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
four by eight pack size but with this

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.800 
four by eight pack size but with this
guy<00:06:09.590> you're<00:06:09.830> stuck<00:06:10.130> with<00:06:10.550> 20<00:06:10.850> inches<00:06:11.120> by<00:06:11.540> five

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
guy you're stuck with 20 inches by five

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.740 
guy you're stuck with 20 inches by five
and<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.020> half<00:06:12.050> by<00:06:12.560> five<00:06:12.830> I<00:06:13.160> mean<00:06:13.820> that's<00:06:14.090> it<00:06:14.360> you

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
and a half by five I mean that's it you

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.870 
and a half by five I mean that's it you
unless<00:06:15.140> you<00:06:15.290> cut<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.680> or<00:06:15.920> give<00:06:16.460> it<00:06:16.490> you<00:06:16.760> know

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880
