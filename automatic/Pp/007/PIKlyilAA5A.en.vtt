00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.860
 I'm not going to talk about that but the 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:18.230
 true when I saw this part of the game 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.570
 you know this is the third lcd the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.390
 second pack of word levels in the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.600
 two reminded me of that I say this this 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.580
 is this is referring to narnia to me that 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.500
 Do not tell me stories that I do not 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.360
 tell stories but what you 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.970
 they will say what you are telling stories 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.079
 are you manuel you were not going to teach us something 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.329
 if we are going to see the protagonists of 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.579
 call of duty cost as that to 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.610
 protagonists of call of duty cost if 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.300
 here in this tlc are all the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.600
 members of the snow band 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.110
 furious are worth as they will be 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.240
 you are now all 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.390
 pensive I just want you to notice 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.390
 the faces of the members is worth 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.480
 all except in that of the dwarves the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.420
 dwarves do not count are the only ones worth 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.360
 this band that do not have then the mask 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.910
 as it has been like all the rest of 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.370
 comrades worth here comes an example of 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.590
 that the dwarves do not have it that way so 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.310
 others all the other members including 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.570
 those who are the ghost lees the goliats and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.430
 others, if they have it they see it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.610
 mask of call of duty ghosts of the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.330
 protagonist yes yes yes yes yes yes yes already 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.790
 they will say what you say manuel but what do you say 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.450
 I've played this dlc and these people are not 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.330
 it seems to the protagonists of the df I say 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.420
 of call of duty ghosts do not look like 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.840
 but the mask resembles a lot 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.240
 Well, because these people go a lot 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.610
 reference are call of duty ghosts 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.990
 which has been released the first call of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.500
 duty that premieres at first 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.440
 generation 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.540
 and it turns out to be a mondongo lirondo but 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.000
 good leaving my opinion at least 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.210
 ice cream and you guys here so here 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 surely they think that way 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.250
 comes in reference to that here the boys 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.470
 they still do not see it they still do not see it 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 worry now I show you I show more 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.340
 images 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 but look, look at this bandit 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.739
 is shooting and what what mask is wearing 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.330
 he wears a mask so goss 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.640
 punishment the truth is that I too 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.470
 is a bit streaked as soon as 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.780
 I was commenting but I wanted to 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.420
 contact him a little bit nothing more 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.230
 little bit more so let's go 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.330
 start to see the corpses come see no 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.819
 is that this has been by chance Manuel 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.830
 I say do not worry I go and I look for another 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.260
 corpse of another rival that has killed and 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 there we have it is the same mask and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.420
 has been making reference to call of duty 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.440
 ghosts as I have been saying in particular 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.790
 is the mask of Elijah which good 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.680
 which after his son inherits it is worth 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.870
 good inherit it we inherit 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.060
 Well, they have what they are seeing 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.670
 Do not tell me not to not tell me no 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.120
 that are not getting scratched 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.879
 since we have never set ourselves, we have never 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.580
 fixed then look at the truth I too 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.260
 when I was commenting on live me 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.209
 I was getting a little bit streaked and 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.069
 I said that I'm going to hire him a 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.349
 product a little bit maybe it has 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.420
 It is given to me because it was so or not 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.440
 been like that but to me that does not tell me the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.959
 history is these people are all carry 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.720
