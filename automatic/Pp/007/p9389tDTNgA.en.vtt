00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
really struggling to find one I like and

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.360 
really struggling to find one I like and
so<00:03:39.780> I've<00:03:39.870> been<00:03:39.989> using<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:41.190> has

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
so I've been using this and it has

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.100 
so I've been using this and it has
cleared<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.760> my<00:03:41.820> skin<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.209> lot<00:03:42.420> which<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.690> thought

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
cleared up my skin a lot which I thought

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.540 
cleared up my skin a lot which I thought
it<00:03:43.200> would<00:03:43.350> because<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.800> n<00:03:43.950> works<00:03:44.250> really<00:03:44.459> well

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
it would because of n works really well

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.850 
it would because of n works really well
on<00:03:44.670> my<00:03:44.850> skin<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:46.140> would<00:03:46.260> say<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.680> even

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
on my skin and I would say that even

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.860 
on my skin and I would say that even
though<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.519> says<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> light<00:03:48.300> hydrating

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
though it says it's a light hydrating

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.960 
though it says it's a light hydrating
cream<00:03:49.140> it's<00:03:49.440> not<00:03:49.800> particularly<00:03:50.280> hydrating<00:03:50.880> it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
cream it's not particularly hydrating it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.880 
cream it's not particularly hydrating it
all<00:03:51.120> light<00:03:51.390> it's<00:03:51.630> definitely<00:03:52.080> not<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.500> would

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
all light it's definitely not I would

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.650 
all light it's definitely not I would
say<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:53.489> even<00:03:53.730> normal<00:03:54.239> skins<00:03:54.510> it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
say this is for even normal skins it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.790 
say this is for even normal skins it
would<00:03:54.780> definitely<00:03:54.930> be<00:03:55.110> for<00:03:55.470> kind<00:03:55.680> of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
would definitely be for kind of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.220 
would definitely be for kind of
combination<00:03:56.070> oily<00:03:56.550> skins<00:03:56.940> because<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.480> have<00:03:58.110> to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
combination oily skins because I have to

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.930 
combination oily skins because I have to
put<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.560> quite<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.800> lot<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.489> feels<00:03:59.700> nice

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
put on quite a lot and it feels nice

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.910 
put on quite a lot and it feels nice
when<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.330> immediately<00:04:00.900> put<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.380> but<00:04:01.709> then

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
when you immediately put it on but then

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.240 
when you immediately put it on but then
it<00:04:02.610> dries<00:04:03.120> quite<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:04.830> dries<00:04:05.040> really

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
it dries quite it just dries really

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.530 
it dries quite it just dries really
quickly<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.880> then<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.120> doesn't<00:04:06.269> feel

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
quickly and then it doesn't feel

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.780 
quickly and then it doesn't feel
particularly<00:04:06.870> moisturizing<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.640> put

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
particularly moisturizing but I can put

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.400 
particularly moisturizing but I can put
up<00:04:08.820> with<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.180> as<00:04:09.330> long<00:04:09.360> as<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.690> sorts<00:04:09.989> out<00:04:10.140> but

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
up with that as long as it sorts out but

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.400 
up with that as long as it sorts out but
like<00:04:10.890> my<00:04:11.070> skin<00:04:11.310> feels<00:04:11.640> nice<00:04:11.910> now<00:04:12.230> but<00:04:13.230> it's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
like my skin feels nice now but it's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.870 
like my skin feels nice now but it's
just<00:04:13.560> really<00:04:13.680> fast<00:04:13.950> better<00:04:14.190> on<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.610> doesn't

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
just really fast better on it doesn't

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.159 
just really fast better on it doesn't
feel<00:04:15.000> particularly<00:04:15.299> moisturizing<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.109> you

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
feel particularly moisturizing so you

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.210 
feel particularly moisturizing so you
should<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.410> aware<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.830> if<00:04:16.979> you're

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
should be aware of that if you're

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.409
