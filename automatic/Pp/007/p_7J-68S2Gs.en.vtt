you're<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.660> holding<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.199> day

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
you're going to be holding it all day

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
you're going to be holding it all day
and<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> nice<00:01:05.970> crisp<00:01:06.299> action<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.810> well
