grinder<00:00:17.760> now<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:19.140> seed<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.380> today<00:00:19.920> is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
grinder now the seed for today is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.349 
grinder now the seed for today is
actually<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.850> negative<00:00:21.270> 1<00:00:21.660> 39<00:00:23.029> 839<00:00:24.029> 1

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
actually going to be negative 1 39 839 1

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
actually going to be negative 1 39 839 1
2<00:00:24.960> 3<00:00:25.039> 4<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.400> I'm<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> repeat<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.180> one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
2 3 4 now I'm going to repeat that one

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.810 
2 3 4 now I'm going to repeat that one
more<00:00:27.539> time<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.890> seed<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.250> also<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.640> down

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
more time so the seed will also be down

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.279 
more time so the seed will also be down
below<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> description<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.929> case<00:00:30.960> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
below in the description in case you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.600 
below in the description in case you
missed<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> both<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.099> times<00:00:32.309> but

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
missed it both of these times but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.930 
missed it both of these times but
negative<00:00:32.969> 1398<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> negative<00:00:36.030> 1<00:00:36.239> 39<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.930> 39<00:00:37.860> 1<00:00:38.640> 2

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
negative 1398 so negative 1 39 a 39 1 2

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.979 
negative 1398 so negative 1 39 a 39 1 2
3<00:00:39.329> 4<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.040> pretty<00:00:41.280> simple<00:00:41.610> seed<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
3 4 so it's a pretty simple seed at that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.799 
3 4 so it's a pretty simple seed at that
but<00:00:43.350> um<00:00:43.590> close<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> spawn<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.450> over

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but um close to spawn over here so over

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.110 
but um close to spawn over here so over
here<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.230> dug<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.399> eventually<00:00:47.700> broke

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
here I dug down and I eventually broke

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.549 
here I dug down and I eventually broke
into<00:00:49.070> something<00:00:50.070> special<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.879> quickly<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
into something special really quickly so

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.779 
into something special really quickly so
I'm<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.680> give<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.010> guys<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.399> coordinates

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
I'm gonna give you guys the coordinates

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
I'm gonna give you guys the coordinates
to<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> whenever<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.629> inside<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.410> so

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to it whenever we get inside of it so

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
to it whenever we get inside of it so
here<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.820> over<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
here we go right over here it's going to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.400 
here we go right over here it's going to
be<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.140> zombie<00:00:58.590> spawner<00:00:58.920> etc<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.480> ravine<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
be a zombie spawner etc of a ravine so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
be a zombie spawner etc of a ravine so
the<00:01:01.770> coordinates<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> zombie<00:01:02.789> spawner

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the coordinates to the zombie spawner

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.460 
the coordinates to the zombie spawner
I'm<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.480> negative<00:01:04.229> 2<00:01:04.439> 03<00:01:04.920> y<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.820> 49<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.720> z<00:01:07.229> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I'm are negative 2 03 y of 49 and z of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.880 
I'm are negative 2 03 y of 49 and z of
148<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.200> inside<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
148 so as you can see it is inside of a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
148 so as you can see it is inside of a
ravine<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:11.909> nothing<00:01:12.060> really

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
ravine now there's nothing really

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
ravine now there's nothing really
special<00:01:13.080> inside<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> chest<00:01:14.520> which<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
special inside of the chest which is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
special inside of the chest which is
unfortunate<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> could<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> bucket

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
unfortunate but you could take a bucket

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.800 
unfortunate but you could take a bucket
out<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:18.229> one<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> chests<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.810> collect

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
out of one of the chests and collect

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
out of one of the chests and collect
this<00:01:21.990> water<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.759> reason<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.180> say<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
this water and the reason why I say that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
this water and the reason why I say that
is<00:01:24.630> because<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.159> break

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
is because right here if you just break

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
is because right here if you just break
these<00:01:26.790> blocks<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
these blocks and you pretty much make it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
these blocks and you pretty much make it
worth<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.979> zombie<00:01:29.310> falls<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> way<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
worth the zombie falls all the way to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
worth the zombie falls all the way to
the<00:01:30.600> ground<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.680> gonna<00:01:31.890> sit<00:01:31.979> down

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the ground you're just gonna sit down

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
the ground you're just gonna sit down
here<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.119> tons<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> rotten<00:01:33.869> flesh

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
here and just get tons of rotten flesh

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
here and just get tons of rotten flesh
or<00:01:34.530> something<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.430> yeah<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
or something like that or yeah just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
or something like that or yeah just
rotting<00:01:36.689> flesh<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.020> won't<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.350> XP<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
rotting flesh you won't get XP but it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.609 
rotting flesh you won't get XP but it
would<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.420> easy<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.930> turn<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.290> into<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
would be really easy to turn this into a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.370 
would be really easy to turn this into a
XP<00:01:41.460> grinder<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:42.119> well<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.810> maybe<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.229> could

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
XP grinder as well so maybe you could

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.620 
XP grinder as well so maybe you could
like<00:01:43.590> make<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> flat<00:01:44.579> platform<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.390> here

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
like make a flat platform down here

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240 
like make a flat platform down here
where<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.990> hurts<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> zombie<00:01:46.770> whenever<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
where it hurts the zombie whenever it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
where it hurts the zombie whenever it
falls<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.689> eventually<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.409> water

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
falls then like eventually the water

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
falls then like eventually the water
like<00:01:49.890> shoves<00:01:50.189> them<00:01:50.340> into<00:01:50.640> something<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
like shoves them into something and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
like shoves them into something and
actually<00:01:51.479> towards<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.590> could<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
actually towards you and you could just

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
actually towards you and you could just
hit<00:01:53.159> them<00:01:53.310> over<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.060> over<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.540> weekend

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
hit them over and over the weekend

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
hit them over and over the weekend
zombie<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.579> that's<00:01:56.579> easy<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.149> next<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> grindr

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
zombie so that's easy for next to grindr

zombie so that's easy for next to grindr
that<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.170> near<00:01:58.380> spawn<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.549> there<00:02:00.060> are

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that is near spawn but there are

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
that is near spawn but there are
actually<00:02:00.570> three<00:02:01.079> zombies<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.219> not

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
just a minute but um there are two

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.720 
just a minute but um there are two
libraries<00:03:04.200> inside<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.800> stronghold<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
libraries inside of the stronghold and a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.900 
libraries inside of the stronghold and a
end<00:03:05.970> portal<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:07.110> know<00:03:07.730> typical<00:03:08.730> good

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
end portal so you know typical good

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.880 
end portal so you know typical good
strong<00:03:09.300> hold<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.870> fairly<00:03:10.260> big<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.710> there

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
strong hold it is fairly big in there

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.130 
strong hold it is fairly big in there
plenty<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.460> chess<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:11.940> definitely<00:03:12.870> good<00:03:13.110> for

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
plenty of chess so definitely good for

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.050 
plenty of chess so definitely good for
exploration<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.700> we're<00:03:14.850> going<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.000> go

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
exploration and now we're going to go

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.660 
exploration and now we're going to go
over<00:03:15.210> here<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.660> check<00:03:16.500> out<00:03:16.710> some<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
over here and check out some of the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.520 
over here and check out some of the
generation<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.570> map<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.350> cave

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
generation on the map there the cave

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.840 
generation on the map there the cave
generation<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.220> map<00:03:20.340> now<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.730> is

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
generation on the map now this is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.100 
generation on the map now this is
something<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.150> actually<00:03:21.240> really<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.959> do

guys the cave generation it's not

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.860 
guys the cave generation it's not
something<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.970> whole<00:03:27.060> lot<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.330> people<00:03:27.510> tend<00:03:27.780> to
