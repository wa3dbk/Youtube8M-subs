jumping<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.759> pointless<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.360> not<00:00:15.540> pointless

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
jumping is pointless it's not pointless

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.099 
jumping is pointless it's not pointless
guys<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.430> basically<00:00:17.430> increase<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.810> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
guys and basically increase your if you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.019 
guys and basically increase your if you
straight<00:00:19.380> jump<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.250> increase<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:20.760> jump

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
straight jump you increase your jump

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.570 
straight jump you increase your jump
high-proof<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.020> jump<00:00:22.289> length<00:00:22.590> by<00:00:22.949> twenty<00:00:23.430> or

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
high-proof you jump length by twenty or

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.519 
high-proof you jump length by twenty or
thirty<00:00:23.820> percent<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.170> jump<00:00:25.320> higher

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
thirty percent so you will jump higher

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.070 
thirty percent so you will jump higher
and<00:00:25.800> move<00:00:25.980> them<00:00:26.189> further

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
and move them further

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
and move them further
so<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.260> straight<00:00:28.500> jump<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.250> two

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
so we straight jump in you can get two

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.609 
so we straight jump in you can get two
spots<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.849> can't<00:00:30.060> get<00:00:30.240> before<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.840> on

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
you want to run it with your left analog

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.500 
you want to run it with your left analog
stick<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.489> want<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.730> turn<00:03:09.970> with<00:03:10.150> your<00:03:10.239> writing

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
log stick then you want to jump at the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.360 
log stick then you want to jump at the
end<00:03:12.870> rather<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.019> edge<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:15.069> I'm<00:03:15.129> gonna<00:03:15.220> show

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
end rather the edge so I'm gonna show

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
end rather the edge so I'm gonna show
that<00:03:15.459> guys<00:03:15.780> one<00:03:16.780> second<00:03:18.299> if<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:19.840> can<00:03:20.019> see<00:03:20.200> it's

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that guys one second if you can see it's

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.229 
that guys one second if you can see it's
a<00:03:20.590> lot<00:03:20.739> easier<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.060> amazing

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
a lot easier and just it's just amazing

a lot easier and just it's just amazing
because<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.870> can<00:03:25.930> jump<00:03:26.200> further<00:03:27.630> then<00:03:28.630> you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
because you can jump further then you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.970
