00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
very carefully which by doing so I saw

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.350 
very carefully which by doing so I saw
three<00:01:34.750> problems<00:01:35.110> with<00:01:35.560> one<00:01:35.830> solution<00:01:36.360> first

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
three problems with one solution first

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.169 
three problems with one solution first
is<00:01:38.190> bumblebee<00:01:41.100> Blake's<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.369> now<00:01:42.729> looking

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
is bumblebee Blake's is now looking

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.490 
is bumblebee Blake's is now looking
better<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.350> more<00:01:44.590> accurate<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.500> movie

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
better and more accurate to the movie

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.320 
better and more accurate to the movie
version<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.450> second<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.750> by<00:01:50.709> doing<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.459> I<00:01:51.759> also

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
version and second is by doing so I also

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.779 
version and second is by doing so I also
allowed<00:01:52.929> a<00:01:53.229> better<00:01:53.740> licked<00:01:54.159> movement

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
allowed a better licked movement

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.109 
allowed a better licked movement
comparing<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.899> what<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:57.399> could<00:01:57.460> do<00:01:57.939> before

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
comparing to what it could do before

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.539 
comparing to what it could do before
before<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.810> believe<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.619> legs<00:01:59.860> can<00:02:00.100> only<00:02:00.310> go

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
before I believe the legs can only go

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
before I believe the legs can only go
this<00:02:00.789> far<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.630> now<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:02.079> goes<00:02:02.289> all<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.039> way<00:02:03.610> in

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this far but now it goes all the way in

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
this far but now it goes all the way in
so<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.979> third

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.270 
you can see that this piece is supposed
to<00:03:07.200> stick<00:03:07.709> out<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.819> back<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.450> form<00:03:10.280> kind

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
to stick out from the back to form kind

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.670 
to stick out from the back to form kind
of<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.819> bottom<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.569> wing<00:03:12.780> section

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
of like the bottom of the wing section

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.610 
of like the bottom of the wing section
but<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.940> know<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.569> can<00:03:15.750> only<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.109> so<00:03:16.139> much<00:03:16.410> for

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
but you know you can only do so much for

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.750 
but you know you can only do so much for
the<00:03:16.709> toys<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.950> know<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.370> way<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the toys but this is you know a way to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.800 
the toys but this is you know a way to
store<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.690> peace<00:03:21.959> without<00:03:22.230> losing<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:23.810> to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
store the peace without losing it and to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.440 
store the peace without losing it and to
fit<00:03:25.049> back<00:03:25.230> into<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.680> body<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.239> not

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
fit back into the body and have it not

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.599 
fit back into the body and have it not
showing<00:03:28.139> up<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.859> obvious<00:03:29.639> as<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:30.090> was<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.609> then

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
showing up as obvious as it was and then

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.960 
showing up as obvious as it was and then
another<00:03:33.480> solution<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.709> mean<00:03:35.099> another<00:03:35.459> thing<00:03:35.819> I

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
another solution I mean another thing I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.680 
another solution I mean another thing I
saw<00:03:36.269> by<00:03:36.870> doing<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.130> with<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.359> piece

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
saw by doing so is that with that piece

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.879 
saw by doing so is that with that piece
there<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.590> hood<00:03:40.889> is<00:03:41.130> now<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:42.739> kind<00:03:43.739> of

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
there the hood is now like kind of

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.569 
there the hood is now like kind of
secure<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.669> back<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.750> instead<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.579> pushing

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
secure to the back so instead of pushing

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.979 
secure to the back so instead of pushing
it<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.590> why<00:03:49.590> not<00:03:49.799> having<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.280> piece<00:03:50.579> here

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
it in why not having this piece here

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.590 
it in why not having this piece here
like<00:03:51.989> so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.280 

without<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.410> piece<00:03:56.830> being<00:03:57.130> there<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:58.290> keep

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
without that piece being there I keep

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.050 
without that piece being there I keep
constantly<00:03:59.890> like<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.220> know<00:04:00.310> pushing<00:04:00.760> this

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
constantly like you know pushing this

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.780 
constantly like you know pushing this
down<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.920> know<00:04:04.200> pushing<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.470> entire<00:04:06.280> top

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
down and you know pushing the entire top

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.810 
down and you know pushing the entire top
of<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.000> car<00:04:07.390> down<00:04:07.630> on<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.560> backpack<00:04:08.770> down<00:04:09.190> but

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
of the car down on the backpack down but

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.810 
of the car down on the backpack down but
by<00:04:10.000> playing<00:04:10.330> this<00:04:10.600> piece<00:04:11.310> into<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.490> chest

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
by playing this piece into the chest

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.100 
by playing this piece into the chest
here<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.960> kind<00:04:14.320> of<00:04:14.440> likes<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:14.920> hold<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.730> back

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
here it kind of likes to hold the back

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.210 
here it kind of likes to hold the back
pack<00:04:17.110> of<00:04:17.380> bumblebee<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.760> place<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.270> lot<00:04:19.660> better

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
pack of bumblebee in place a lot better

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:31.520 
pack of bumblebee in place a lot better
so<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:24.450> haven't<00:04:25.740> put<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:28.410> tap<00:04:29.410> into<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
so and I haven't put the tap into the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.490 
so and I haven't put the tap into the
back<00:04:32.530> of<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:33.250> car<00:04:33.780> yet<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.750> it's<00:04:38.050> not

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
back of the car yet so but it's not

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.020 
back of the car yet so but it's not
going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.770> be<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.890> hard<00:04:39.310> all<00:04:39.520> i<00:04:39.580> have<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:39.820> do

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
going to be that hard all i have to do

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.770 
going to be that hard all i have to do
is<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:40.380> add<00:04:41.380> some<00:04:41.700> kind<00:04:42.700> of<00:04:42.790> hinges<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.540> that

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
is just add some kind of hinges so that

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.270 
is just add some kind of hinges so that
when<00:04:43.960> i<00:04:43.990> transform<00:04:44.530> back<00:04:44.650> in<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.920> car<00:04:45.130> just

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
when i transform back in the car just

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.070 
when i transform back in the car just
plug<00:04:45.610> right<00:04:45.820> in<00:04:46.090> um<00:04:47.670> but<00:04:48.670> this<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.180> what<00:04:49.600> i<00:04:49.630> have

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
plug right in um but this is what i have

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.050 
plug right in um but this is what i have
so<00:04:50.290> far<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.580> as<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.970> can<00:04:52.120> see<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:53.490> feet<00:04:54.490> for

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
so far so as you can see the feet for

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.350 
so far so as you can see the feet for
the<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.840> leg<00:04:56.080> part<00:04:56.610> looks<00:04:57.610> more<00:04:58.000> like<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
the the leg part looks more like the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.710 
the the leg part looks more like the
movie<00:04:58.720> version<00:04:58.870> now<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:02.670> and<00:05:03.670> as<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.300> barrel

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
movie version now and and as a barrel

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.750 
movie version now and and as a barrel
length<00:05:04.930> movement<00:05:06.690> i<00:05:07.710> think<00:05:08.710> this<00:05:08.890> is<00:05:09.160> as<00:05:09.430> far

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
length movement i think this is as far

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.710 
length movement i think this is as far
as<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.210> would<00:05:10.750> do<00:05:11.290> to<00:05:11.650> bumblebee<00:05:12.280> i<00:05:12.670> don't<00:05:13.480> think

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
as I would do to bumblebee i don't think

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.940 
as I would do to bumblebee i don't think
i<00:05:13.840> will<00:05:14.340> be<00:05:15.990> customizing<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.110> chest<00:05:17.440> piece<00:05:17.740> to

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
i will be customizing the chest piece to

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.740 
i will be customizing the chest piece to
angle<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.760> because<00:05:19.030> i<00:05:19.150> felt<00:05:19.420> like<00:05:19.480> that's

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
angle and because i felt like that's

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.380 
angle and because i felt like that's
just<00:05:20.050> way<00:05:20.530> too<00:05:20.590> much<00:05:20.950> work<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.820> all<00:05:22.060> know<00:05:22.240> if

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
just way too much work and I all know if

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.570 
just way too much work and I all know if
it<00:05:22.570> would<00:05:22.750> even<00:05:22.990> going<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.860> work<00:05:24.070> so<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.470> oh

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
it would even going to work so and oh

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.800 
it would even going to work so and oh
another<00:05:27.580> thing<00:05:27.730> I<00:05:28.030> before<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.720> did<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.110> cab<00:05:29.350> I

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
another thing I before I did the cab I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.360 
another thing I before I did the cab I
kind<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.990> turned<00:05:32.260> them<00:05:32.560> x<00:05:33.400> into<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> blade<00:05:35.370> so

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
kind of turned them x into a blade so

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.290 
kind of turned them x into a blade so
because<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.570> how<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.260> X<00:05:38.740> were<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.700> angle<00:05:40.270> was

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
because of how the X were the angle was

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.220 
because of how the X were the angle was
kind<00:05:40.900> of<00:05:41.020> awkward<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:42.670> X<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.780> part<00:05:44.080> where

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
kind of awkward the X the part where

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.030 
kind of awkward the X the part where
chop<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.890> facing<00:05:45.820> upward<00:05:46.780> instead<00:05:46.990> of<00:05:47.380> you

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
chop is facing upward instead of you

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.460 
chop is facing upward instead of you
know<00:05:48.070> facing<00:05:48.700> down<00:05:48.940> so<00:05:49.330> you<00:05:49.720> know<00:05:49.840> nobody<00:05:50.230> chop

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
know facing down so you know nobody chop

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.580 
know facing down so you know nobody chop
upward<00:05:50.980> if<00:05:51.190> you<00:05:51.310> chop<00:05:51.610> downward<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.260> turned
