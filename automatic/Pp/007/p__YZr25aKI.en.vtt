is yeah exactly
so<00:01:47.410> that's<00:01:47.710> pretty<00:01:48.009> straight<00:01:48.460> ahead<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
so that's pretty straight ahead it's a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:58.169 
so that's pretty straight ahead it's a
little<00:01:49.690> bit<00:01:49.780> faster<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.259> think<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:58.000> I

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
little bit faster I think it's like if I

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.980 
little bit faster I think it's like if I
could<00:01:58.390> rap<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.929> would<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.600> really<00:02:01.810> like

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
could rap I would because I really like

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.149
