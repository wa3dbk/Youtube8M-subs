00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
always start from the top and just do

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
always start from the top and just do

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
just like working from the bottle gets a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
just like working from the bottle gets a
lot<00:01:02.100> faster<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.640> me<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.300> once

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
keep in mind that this jumbo set is made

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.960 
keep in mind that this jumbo set is made
for<00:01:32.229> volume<00:01:32.530> this<00:01:32.890> particular<00:01:33.490> set<00:01:33.759> isn't

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
for volume this particular set isn't

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.880 
for volume this particular set isn't
really<00:01:34.299> made<00:01:34.479> for<00:01:34.659> curls<00:01:35.110> so<00:01:35.619> if<00:01:35.770> you're

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
really made for curls so if you're

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.530 
really made for curls so if you're
wanting<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.220> achieve<00:01:36.310> more<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.850> curl<00:01:37.090> look<00:01:37.360> I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
wanting to achieve more of a curl look I

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.300 
wanting to achieve more of a curl look I
would<00:01:37.690> definitely<00:01:38.080> go<00:01:38.200> with<00:01:38.350> Connor's<00:01:38.799> multi

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
would definitely go with Connor's multi

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.249 
would definitely go with Connor's multi
Roller<00:01:39.549> set<00:01:41.670> I'll<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:42.850> pop<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.659> wire<00:01:43.869> clip

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
Roller set I'll just pop that wire clip

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:55.100 
Roller set I'll just pop that wire clip
right<00:01:44.440> into<00:01:44.740> place

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 

now<00:01:55.650> I<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.890> someone<00:01:56.370> over<00:01:56.670> direct<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.150> Roller

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
now I do someone over direct my Roller

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.360 
now I do someone over direct my Roller
placement<00:01:57.870> just<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.620> whenever<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.160> hair

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
placement just because whenever my hair

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.610 
placement just because whenever my hair
falls<00:01:59.640> sometimes<00:02:00.300> if<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.720> sectioned<00:02:01.200> -

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
falls sometimes if it's sectioned -

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.260 
falls sometimes if it's sectioned -
precisely<00:02:02.010> you'll<00:02:02.400> see<00:02:02.610> exactly<00:02:02.940> where<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
precisely you'll see exactly where the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.180 
precisely you'll see exactly where the
roller<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.870> just<00:02:04.470> because<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:04.950> hair

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
roller was just because of my hair

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.280 
roller was just because of my hair
textures<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.150> like<00:02:06.450> making<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:06.960> roller

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
textures so I do like making my roller

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.740 
textures so I do like making my roller
placement<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.070> more<00:02:08.250> random<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.510> as<00:02:15.630> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
placement a little more random but as I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
placement a little more random but as I
stated<00:02:16.050> before<00:02:16.140> that's<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.830> personal

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
going to start from the bottom up just

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.750 
going to start from the bottom up just
the<00:03:24.630> way<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.930> apply<00:03:25.170> them<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.310> just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
the way that I apply them in so just

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.190 
the way that I apply them in so just
first<00:03:27.660> taking<00:03:28.110> out<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.470> little<00:03:28.590> clips<00:03:29.040> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
first taking out the little clips and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.640 
first taking out the little clips and
releasing<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.620> roller<00:03:32.840> now<00:03:33.840> don't<00:03:34.110> just<00:03:34.319> tug

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
releasing the roller now don't just tug

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
since these rollers are ceramic I

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.010 
since these rollers are ceramic I
definitely<00:04:26.250> noticed<00:04:26.610> some<00:04:26.729> shine<00:04:27.090> added<00:04:27.630> into
