00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
is the dig way and many of these are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.090 
is the dig way and many of these are
viable<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.909> absolutely<00:01:06.360> no<00:01:06.570> idea<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.930> think

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
viable I have absolutely no idea i think

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.580 
viable I have absolutely no idea i think
generally<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.659> value<00:01:10.080> vision<00:01:10.439> very

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
generally we we we value vision very

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.609 
generally we we we value vision very
highly<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.189> think<00:01:11.400> vision<00:01:11.670> wins<00:01:11.880> games<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.619> we

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
highly we think vision wins games and we

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
highly we think vision wins games and we
have<00:01:13.740> yet<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.100> proven<00:01:14.430> otherwise<00:01:14.549> actually

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
have yet to be proven otherwise actually

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
have yet to be proven otherwise actually
by<00:01:15.540> any<00:01:15.689> region<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.490> maybe<00:01:17.729> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
by any region and so I think maybe we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
by any region and so I think maybe we
might<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.299> doing<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> too<00:01:18.689> much<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.290> I'd

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
might be doing it too much but I'd

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.499 
might be doing it too much but I'd
rather<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.310> doing<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> than<00:01:21.119> doing<00:01:21.330> too

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
rather be doing that than doing too

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
rather be doing that than doing too

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
to you right now are these guys your
type<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> competition<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.780> maybe<00:01:31.049> who<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
type of competition or maybe who is I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.620 
type of competition or maybe who is I
think<00:01:32.220> CLG<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.729> definitely<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> teams

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
think CLG is definitely one of the teams

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.450 
think CLG is definitely one of the teams
that<00:01:33.689> gives<00:01:33.900> us<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> most<00:01:34.140> problems<00:01:34.650> they

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that gives us the most problems they

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.219 
that gives us the most problems they
have<00:01:35.670> certain<00:01:36.509> things<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.840> their<00:01:37.049> team

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
have certain things about their team

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.510 
have certain things about their team
that<00:01:37.439> make<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> hard<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.009> our<00:01:38.250> team<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that make it hard for our team to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.749 
that make it hard for our team to
perform<00:01:38.790> well<00:01:39.090> against<00:01:39.360> them<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:41.040> think

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
perform well against them and I think

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.670 
perform well against them and I think
that<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> game<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that go into this game is just going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
that go into this game is just going to
be<00:01:43.799> decided<00:01:44.070> by<00:01:44.340> how<00:01:44.640> much<00:01:44.790> vision<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.299> can

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
be decided by how much vision we can

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
be decided by how much vision we can
actually<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.869> control<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.979> game<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.399> so

actually can control in this game and so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.370 
actually can control in this game and so

their shifter in Zion I feel like on an
individual<00:02:01.290> skill<00:02:01.619> level<00:02:01.950> dignitas<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
individual skill level dignitas is is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.780 
individual skill level dignitas is is
top<00:02:03.149> tier<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.469> another

top tier do you think that's another

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.620 
top tier do you think that's another
part<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> separate<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> from

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.390 
syrup is it may be doing quite as well I
definitely<00:02:10.349> think<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> new<00:02:10.770> pickups<00:02:11.099> were

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400

I've<00:02:29.040> ever<00:02:29.069> seen<00:02:29.720> he's<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> demon<00:02:31.290> when<00:02:31.380> it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I've ever seen he's like a demon when it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
comes to grinding solo q so he's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.880

definitely<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.319> players<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.800> watch

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
definitely one of the players to watch

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.410 
definitely one of the players to watch
out<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.610> think<00:02:35.700> right<00:02:35.940> now<00:02:36.150> he's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
out for because I think right now he's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.020 
out for because I think right now he's
yet<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.440> fully<00:02:37.739> even<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.580> even

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
yet to be like fully even like even

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.600 
yet to be like fully even like even
close<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.450> hitting<00:02:39.720> his<00:02:40.020> cap<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:41.400> means

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
close to hitting his cap and that means

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.370 
close to hitting his cap and that means
like<00:02:41.970> already<00:02:42.300> he's<00:02:42.510> shown<00:02:42.780> himself<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.200> at

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
like already he's shown himself to be at

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.660 
like already he's shown himself to be at
the<00:02:43.440> top<00:02:43.560> three<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:43.980> they<00:02:44.040> mid<00:02:44.190> laners<00:02:44.489> I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the top three and they mid laners I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.600 
the top three and they mid laners I
think<00:02:45.090> he's<00:02:45.239> only<00:02:45.480> has<00:02:45.690> up<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.620> upwards<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
think he's only has up like upwards to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.449 
think he's only has up like upwards to
go<00:02:47.700> from<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.110> that'll<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.170> fun<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.950> in
