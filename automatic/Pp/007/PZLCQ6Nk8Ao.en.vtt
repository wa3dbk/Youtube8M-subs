the target but since you're using curse
you're<00:01:21.390> pretty<00:01:21.540> much<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.810> blast<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you're pretty much going blast all the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
you're pretty much going blast all the
time<00:01:22.680> anyway<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.130> paybacks<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> always

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
time anyway so paybacks going to always

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
time anyway so paybacks going to always
beginning<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> hundred<00:01:25.530> base<00:01:25.650> power<00:01:25.860> would

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
beginning for a hundred base power would

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.819 
beginning for a hundred base power would
stab<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.420> boost<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> attack<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.619> that's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
stab with your boost to attack so that's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.830 
stab with your boost to attack so that's
incredibly<00:01:29.340> strong<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.150> toxic<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
incredibly strong and you have toxic to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
incredibly strong and you have toxic to
get<00:01:30.990> even<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.409> damage<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> stall<00:01:32.780> it's
