00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.140 

now<00:01:08.990> there<00:01:09.710> are<00:01:09.860> some<00:01:10.160> tutorials<00:01:10.910> out<00:01:11.090> there

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
now there are some tutorials out there

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.410 
now there are some tutorials out there
but<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.660> far<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:11.990> haven't<00:01:12.140> found<00:01:12.500> any<00:01:13.250> videos<00:01:13.940> on

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
but so far I haven't found any videos on

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.710 
but so far I haven't found any videos on
YouTube<00:01:14.900> or<00:01:15.229> any<00:01:15.470> other<00:01:15.650> website<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.550> all<00:01:17.540> the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
YouTube or any other website and all the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.670 
YouTube or any other website and all the
written<00:01:18.110> tutorials<00:01:20.320> require<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.560> have

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
written tutorials require you to have

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.499 
written tutorials require you to have
prior<00:01:22.130> knowledge<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.700> how<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:22.940> use<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.180> hex

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
prior knowledge of how to use a hex

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.830 
prior knowledge of how to use a hex
editor<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:25.729> had<00:01:26.000> no<00:01:26.149> idea<00:01:26.450> how<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.690> use<00:01:26.750> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
editor and I had no idea how to use a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.730 
editor and I had no idea how to use a
hex<00:01:27.110> editor<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.960> yeah<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.110> was<00:01:30.200> kind<00:01:30.320> of

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
hex editor so yeah it was kind of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.330 
hex editor so yeah it was kind of
challenging<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:32.619> figure<00:01:33.619> out<00:01:33.920> what<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.220> was

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
challenging to figure out what I was

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.400 
challenging to figure out what I was
meant<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.670> do<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.420> really<00:01:35.660> involved<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.259> lot

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
meant to do and it really involved a lot

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.570 
meant to do and it really involved a lot
of<00:01:36.440> trial<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:36.979> error<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:39.009> I'm<00:01:40.009> gonna<00:01:40.220> show<00:01:40.520> you

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
of trial and error so I'm gonna show you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.219 
of trial and error so I'm gonna show you
how<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> figured<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.780> out

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
how I figured it out

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.980 
how I figured it out

gonna<00:02:30.710> have<00:02:32.020> Program<00:02:33.020> Files<00:02:33.370> x86<00:02:34.370> or<00:02:34.970> this

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
gonna have Program Files x86 or this

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360 
gonna have Program Files x86 or this
program<00:02:35.390> files<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:36.140> now<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> deal<00:02:36.740> with<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.010> x86

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
program files up now I deal with the x86

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.210 
program files up now I deal with the x86
stands<00:02:37.910> for<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:39.110> if<00:02:39.560> you've<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.980> got

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
stands for but if you've just got

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.770 
stands for but if you've just got
Program<00:02:40.580> Files<00:02:40.790> it'll<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.270> in<00:02:41.360> there<00:02:41.540> if

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
Program Files it'll be in there if

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.990 
Program Files it'll be in there if
you've<00:02:41.930> got<00:02:42.080> x86<00:02:42.830> it'll<00:02:43.100> most<00:02:43.340> likely<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.760> in

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
you've got x86 it'll most likely be in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.300 
you've got x86 it'll most likely be in
that<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.260> yeah<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.960> then<00:02:48.130> you're<00:02:49.130> gonna

want to find origin games yep as I said
and<00:02:54.800> live<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.400> being<00:02:55.610> program<00:02:56.150> files<00:02:56.450> or

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and live the being program files or

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.600 
and live the being program files or
Program<00:02:57.200> Files<00:02:57.380> x86<00:02:59.320> now<00:03:00.320> you're<00:03:01.160> gonna<00:03:01.340> want

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
Program Files x86 now you're gonna want

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.640 
Program Files x86 now you're gonna want
to<00:03:01.700> go<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.030> open<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.600> up<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:03.080> go<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.290> mystic
