00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540

and while it comes with a normal pen ink

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.630 
and while it comes with a normal pen ink
thing<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.630> also<00:00:41.840> comes<00:00:42.020> with<00:00:42.080> the<00:00:42.230> UV<00:00:42.710> need<00:00:43.040> so

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
thing it also comes with the UV need so

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.280 
thing it also comes with the UV need so
you<00:00:43.670> can<00:00:43.940> ride<00:00:44.210> on<00:00:44.239> stuff<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:44.930> it's<00:00:45.020> invisible

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
you can ride on stuff and it's invisible

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.860 
you can ride on stuff and it's invisible
until<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:46.220> shine<00:00:46.460> ultraviolet<00:00:47.270> light<00:00:47.570> on<00:00:47.720> it

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
until you shine ultraviolet light on it

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.390 
until you shine ultraviolet light on it
so<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:48.140> was<00:00:48.559> writing<00:00:48.860> stuff<00:00:49.160> all<00:00:49.370> over

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400

light<00:00:51.350> or<00:00:51.650> one<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.309> these<00:00:52.489> shine<00:00:53.150> it<00:00:53.270> around

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
light or one of these shine it around

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.229 
light or one of these shine it around
random<00:00:54.440> places<00:00:54.680> probably<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.910> backs<00:00:56.089> of

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
random places probably the backs of

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
look around Melbourne for a bit I've

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.690 
look around Melbourne for a bit I've
only<00:01:12.200> been<00:01:12.409> there<00:01:12.560> once<00:01:12.860> before<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.370> I<00:01:13.460> didn't

like<00:01:13.940> very<00:01:13.970> much<00:01:14.330> probably<00:01:14.900> because<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.229> was

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
like very much probably because it was

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.410 
like very much probably because it was
raining<00:01:15.560> all<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.950> time<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:16.970> time<00:01:17.030> was

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
raining all the time but this time was

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.090 
raining all the time but this time was
much<00:01:17.659> better<00:01:17.870> experience<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.680> got<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.920> see<00:01:19.070> a

much better experience I got to see a
bit<00:01:19.280> more<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:20.000> feels<00:01:20.240> very<00:01:20.330> much<00:01:20.600> like<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
bit more it feels very much like a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.210 
bit more it feels very much like a
delayed<00:01:21.229> in<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:24.080> just<00:01:24.320> does<00:01:24.530> people

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220

Adelaide and sort of Melbourne felt a

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.819 
Adelaide and sort of Melbourne felt a
lot<00:01:35.659> like<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.840> delayed<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.380> was<00:01:36.500> over<00:01:36.740> there

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
lot like a delayed when I was over there

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.679 
lot like a delayed when I was over there
but<00:01:37.159> it<00:01:37.250> was<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.460> architecture<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.149> roads

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689

but it was the architecture the roads
were<00:01:39.049> all<00:01:39.229> straight<00:01:39.860> lines<00:01:40.130> like<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.789> Adelaide

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
were all straight lines like in Adelaide

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.819 
were all straight lines like in Adelaide
I<00:01:41.420> don't<00:01:41.600> know<00:01:41.659> what<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.840> was<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.020> um<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.799> just

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
spin and it would get really far us and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.580 
spin and it would get really far us and
you<00:03:05.810> couldn't<00:03:06.020> see<00:03:06.110> what's<00:03:06.260> happening<00:03:06.500> and

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.390 
then though turn on a strobe light and
then<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:09.110> would<00:03:09.350> look<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.530> fall<00:03:09.860> yet<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
then it would look like fall yet the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.030 
then it would look like fall yet the
people<00:03:10.519> are<00:03:10.790> moving<00:03:10.970> animated<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.860> was
