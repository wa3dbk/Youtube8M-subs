didn't go to plan sort of speak am I had

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.070 
didn't go to plan sort of speak am I had
a<00:00:16.500> couple<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> injuries<00:00:17.609> which<00:00:17.960> kept<00:00:18.960> me<00:00:19.020> out

of<00:00:19.140> action<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.220> think<00:00:20.609> there's<00:00:20.730> nothing

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
of action and I think there's nothing

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.320 
of action and I think there's nothing
worse<00:00:21.240> than<00:00:21.539> being<00:00:21.920> sort<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.210> segregated<00:00:24.210> from

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
worse than being sort of segregated from

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150

that<00:04:58.200> I<00:04:58.230> think<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.590> main<00:04:58.770> differences<00:04:59.250> as<00:04:59.550> a

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
that I think the main differences as a

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.630 
that I think the main differences as a
few<00:04:59.910> new<00:05:00.060> put<00:05:00.330> air<00:05:00.540> faces<00:05:01.200> when<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.130> left<00:05:02.460> there

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
as L the one off in last year and as I

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.630 
as L the one off in last year and as I
said<00:06:24.810> though<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.890> goal<00:06:26.100> is<00:06:26.250> years<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.550> win

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
said though the the goal is years to win

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.640 
said though the the goal is years to win
or<00:06:26.820> free<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.210> anything<00:06:28.020> but<00:06:28.230> less<00:06:28.410> than<00:06:28.560> that

or free and anything but less than that

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.250 
or free and anything but less than that
is<00:06:28.710> a<00:06:29.040> failure<00:06:29.430> finally<00:06:30.300> we<00:06:30.420> guess<00:06:31.020> when<00:06:31.170> you

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
is a failure finally we guess when you

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.110 
is a failure finally we guess when you
pull<00:06:31.440> on<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:32.100> cherry<00:06:32.370> and<00:06:32.460> wire<00:06:32.640> again<00:06:32.790> and

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
pull on the cherry and wire again and

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.120 
pull on the cherry and wire again and
run<00:06:33.510> out<00:06:33.630> here<00:06:33.810> that'll<00:06:34.020> be<00:06:34.169> a<00:06:34.410> pretty<00:06:34.740> special
