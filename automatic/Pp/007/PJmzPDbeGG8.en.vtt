00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310

it<00:00:58.520> not<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.090> original<00:00:59.480> key<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
it not in the original key so in the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.170 
it not in the original key so in the
lesson<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:00.710> talked<00:01:00.890> about<00:01:00.920> transposing<00:01:01.790> it

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
lesson we talked about transposing it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.660 
lesson we talked about transposing it
because<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.800> makes<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.130> little<00:01:04.250> bit<00:01:04.400> easier

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
because it makes it a little bit easier

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.360 
because it makes it a little bit easier
to<00:01:04.730> sing<00:01:05.030> or<00:01:05.210> something<00:01:05.480> like<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.130> if<00:01:07.130> I

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
to sing or something like that so if I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.710 
to sing or something like that so if I
have<00:01:07.580> any<00:01:07.700> chance<00:01:07.910> of<00:01:08.060> saying<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.420> I<00:01:08.540> had<00:01:08.660> to

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
have any chance of saying this I had to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.140 
have any chance of saying this I had to
sing<00:01:08.900> in<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.080> key<00:01:09.260> of<00:01:09.290> A<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.340> transposed<00:01:11.000> a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
sing in the key of A so I transposed a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.530 
sing in the key of A so I transposed a
little<00:01:11.360> lick<00:01:11.600> from<00:01:12.440> D<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:13.150> this<00:01:14.150> is<00:01:14.330> what<00:01:14.450> it

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
little lick from D to a this is what it

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.969 
little lick from D to a this is what it
sounded<00:01:14.750> like<00:01:14.810> indeed<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.790> we<00:01:16.910> added<00:01:17.150> him

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
sounded like indeed and we added him

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.880 
sounded like indeed and we added him
basically<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.020> keyboard<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.650> doing

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
right there adding a little bluesy twist

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.270 
right there adding a little bluesy twist
to<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.660> by<00:01:23.869> throwing<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.260> a<00:01:24.290> minor<00:01:24.560> third<00:01:24.920> in

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to it by throwing in a minor third in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.969 
to it by throwing in a minor third in
