00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 also our customers many doubts 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.420
 about this about it is about the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.890
 amino acid tablets and a good 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.270
 installed protein 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 yes good is a very common question and a 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.890
 very normal information that that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 find today the difference these 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.430
 are amino acids in tablets and the best 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 way of taking it what crushes us 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.210
 distributors enriching it with the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 meals is worth adding amino acids in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.119
 peptide tryp style set with the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.780
 meals help us increase the value 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.190
 biological of the meals what 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.910
 we comment takes the biological because the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.259
 milk 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.640
 we know he has one of the biggest 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350
 biological values of all 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.659
 proteins 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.220
 that the good biological value normally 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.880
 to know the biological value of a 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.729
 protein we rule to the human pattern 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.700
 of amino acids especially to DNA against 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.920
 more know the amino acid pattern of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200
 product to your body to your 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.580
 cellular greater geological value of such 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.830
 then adding the meals 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.840
 we increase the biological value of 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.850
 meals and so even for people who 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.280
 have problems eating a lot 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.680
 of meat I read again proteins 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.479
 and solid and thus help 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.170
 consume less quantity less volume 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.399
 adding tablet is worth and in the degree of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.630
 protein is more specific to take it 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.250
 before the trainings one hour 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 average in front of the workouts is worth 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.200
 or just at the end of the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.090
 training if you take before always 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 advise him to take it half an hour an hour 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.640
 before because the protein even being 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.230
 in this way isolated to flow to flow a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.030
 micro crossed a protein brought from the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.670
 cold of quite quality 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.190
 it requires blood for borgetti and if it 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.640
 we take very close to the training we 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.110
 gives the blood of co-management for the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.120
 muscular work and can not pass on 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.959
 what is the fatigue of fatigue 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.150
 muscular 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.230
 even when good when we finished 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.930
 to train if you can take 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.910
 immediately because the purpose of 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 exercise has finished and the body 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.360
 it requires blood to maintain the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.420
 muscle and can you can make a 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.750
 direction with a normal and natural tuna and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.750
 Go ahead 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.209
 Take the week 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.209
 it's not worth it 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.830
 but
