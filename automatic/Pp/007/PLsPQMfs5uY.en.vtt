00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
along the ball this cursor represents

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.580 
along the ball this cursor represents
where<00:02:31.850> my<00:02:32.240> club<00:02:32.570> is<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.959> impact<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.680 
where my club is going to impact the
ball<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> sweet<00:02:34.760> spot<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.240> club<00:02:35.510> is

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
ball so the sweet spot of the club is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.360

going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.930> impact<00:02:36.200> right<00:02:36.500> where<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:36.740> red<00:02:37.130> dot

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
going to impact right where that red dot

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.660 
going to impact right where that red dot
is<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.480> if<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.750> want<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.110> hit<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> ball<00:02:39.680> thin<00:02:40.190> for

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
is so if I want to hit the ball thin for

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.010 
is so if I want to hit the ball thin for
example<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.360> would<00:02:42.260> raise<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.040> up<00:02:43.100> high<00:02:45.910> I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
example I would raise it up high I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.040 
example I would raise it up high I
wanted<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.200> hit<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.530> fat<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.490> would<00:02:49.850> place<00:02:50.810> this

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
wanted to hit it fat I would place this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.340 
wanted to hit it fat I would place this
cursor<00:02:51.470> right<00:02:51.800> underneath<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.340> ball<00:02:53.350> go

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
cursor right underneath the ball go

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.250 
cursor right underneath the ball go
ahead<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.709> take<00:02:54.830> my<00:02:54.860> swing<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:57.110> was<00:02:57.230> a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
ahead and take my swing and that was a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.740 
ahead and take my swing and that was a
little<00:02:57.530> too<00:02:57.650> fat<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.820> element<00:02:59.630> is<00:02:59.690> going

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
little too fat so this element is going

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.830 
little too fat so this element is going
to<00:02:59.870> give<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.530> way<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> customize<00:03:01.940> your<00:03:02.330> shot

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

rough or you're buried in a bunker

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.949 
rough or you're buried in a bunker
you're<00:03:07.910> going<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.090> use<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.780> get

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
you're going to use that to get

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.170 
you're going to use that to get
underneath<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.410> ball<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.010> get<00:03:10.519> safely<00:03:11.030> out

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
underneath the ball and get safely out

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.690 
underneath the ball and get safely out
of<00:03:11.209> those<00:03:11.360> hazards<00:03:11.900> for<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:13.040> particular

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
of those hazards for this particular

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.229 
of those hazards for this particular
shot

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
shot

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.210 
shot
pretty<00:03:14.930> good<00:03:15.110> right<00:03:15.140> there<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.769> sitting<00:03:16.130> a

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
pretty good right there it is sitting a

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.680 
pretty good right there it is sitting a
little<00:03:16.370> bit<00:03:16.519> down<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> fairway<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:17.510> I'm

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
little bit down in the fairway so I'm

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.660 
little bit down in the fairway so I'm
just<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.140> nudge<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.380> down<00:03:18.709> just<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.100> touch

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
just going to nudge it down just a touch

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.290 
just going to nudge it down just a touch
you<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.450> land<00:03:21.050> it<00:03:21.230> safely<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.920> green

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.900 

and<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:27.230> looks<00:03:27.470> like<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.830> works<00:03:28.040> one<00:03:28.760> thing

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and that looks like it works one thing

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.220 
and that looks like it works one thing
you're<00:03:29.030> gonna<00:03:29.120> want<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.450> watch<00:03:29.570> out<00:03:29.810> for<00:03:30.020> in

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
you're gonna want to watch out for in

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.980 
you're gonna want to watch out for in
the<00:03:30.290> higher<00:03:30.500> difficulty<00:03:31.190> levels<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.870> you

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
the higher difficulty levels is that you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.500 
the higher difficulty levels is that you
don't<00:03:33.230> get<00:03:33.380> too<00:03:33.560> carried<00:03:33.800> away<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.510> missed

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
don't get too carried away and missed

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.300 
don't get too carried away and missed
the<00:03:35.630> ball<00:03:35.780> entirely<00:03:36.140> if<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.740> go<00:03:36.890> too<00:03:36.950> high

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
the ball entirely if you go too high

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.720 
the ball entirely if you go too high
with<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.570> swing<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.770> miss<00:03:39.980> so

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
with it you swing and you miss so

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.190 
with it you swing and you miss so
definitely<00:03:41.090> be<00:03:41.240> careful<00:03:41.450> with<00:03:41.780> that

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
definitely be careful with that

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.990 
definitely be careful with that
so<00:03:42.440> all<00:03:42.620> these<00:03:42.770> new<00:03:43.010> shots<00:03:43.310> setup<00:03:43.640> features

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
so all these new shots setup features
