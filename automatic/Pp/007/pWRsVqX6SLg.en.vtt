00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.610
 speaks site youtube guys down info 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.259
 thing for you a rock motherboard box 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.880
 970 own 3 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.390
 this is one of motherboards 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 intermediate for amd teachers 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 OMG 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.169
 so here we have the hunting super good 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.169
 packed 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.469
 I bought the best mammoth online store 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.829
 Now we'll check to see the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.920
 It 's not what people are saying. 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:56.040
 I expected beauty so we have here the plaque 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.310
 here we have the plate invoice 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.350
 I got a very interesting price. 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.339
 three hundred and sixty-seven reais and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.890
 twenty cents a plate the standard price 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.229
 of it for around 400 reais 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.710
 the g1 on the internet I got there 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.049
 up to R $ 543 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.759
 of course this price was seen but by 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 337 reais 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.979
 is a well-priced price to pay a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.259
 motherboard that this category does not 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.609
 is one of the top tops but sure 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:39.079
 this is for you to put together a good 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:45.049
 computer takes a look usb 3.0 in two 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.049
 front two on the motherboard itself 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.579
 windows 8 mm crossfire then is already a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.420
 motherboard for you to use two 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:02:00.090
 or more plates of two video cards x 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 amd as was stated previously the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:13.069
 chipset of the 3rd board and 1973 plus four 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 lots of r 3 up to 2005 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.920
 at this speed is very dependent too 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.439
 the teacher you are going to put in the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.579
 plate 2006 press 2.0 x16 some boards 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:30.739
 where it already comes with a pc and 3.0 nÃ© but this 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.530
 because I do not even study yet 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.109
 so much difference so a pci express 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.549
 2.0 also made a beautiful ones 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.700
 smallest two special entries is 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.639
 channel 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.430
 7.1 audio can put an invitation 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.069
 directly on the plant or the motherboard at 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.469
 realize for example alan her with a 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.269
 Connection to accelerate that's what he 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:59.209
 calls heartthrob to six entries SATA 3.0 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.250
 if I'm not mistaken, a boring one in reference 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:10.519
 at 6 o'clock 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:13.750
 is per second of speed 430 in 2012 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.750
 usb 2.0 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:46.269
 this is the gate and the plate to the box 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:46.269
 people see the plate that is the part that goes 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:59.350
 how to install a board in the cabinet 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 the board manual in English by the way 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.930
 huh 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.080
 here is a quick-rescue guide in which 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.090
 has the cd also gives one of several 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.580
 these motherboards we received a lot of 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.580
 people have to stay in the river connected by 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.100
 fact that 10 to 12 places would not be 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.530
 last released by the manufacturer 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.090
 sometimes that was a time in 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.340
 that internet authorizations so 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.600
 interesting is maybe they 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.440
 always take a look if we have 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:38.540
 updates on the internet or not the cables 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:43.250
 sata hdl connection led to prosecution 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:56.740
 there are not two ways, we only have to end 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:05:08.690
 we have the motherboard she's in a 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:16.310
 stadium and also some kind of shock in the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:17.810
 here foam investment will remind 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.510
 that I have already withdrawn static 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.510
 locke body underneath 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.390
 and here we have the connections, right? 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:37.540
 then 172 usb 2.0 then one two three 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:45.120
 four five six ou10 magellan nÃ© 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:45.120
 to usb 3.0 they are in blue colors to 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:55.630
 input with the board teaches then initiates 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:59.200
 all black was very popular and 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.560
 computerized cool thing about 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.560
 to see nÃ© 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:15.870
 that's it then the df x support up to 10 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:35.410
 973 quality 140 vacancies this is a guy 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:40.660
 that could support the teacher me 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:42.669
 put here will be 3 20m from me not 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:56.190
 is 95 watts 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:56.190
 I have to, that 's my route 973 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.530
 If you liked to comment and 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:09.180
 share it there 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:09.180
 remembering that it is already here are 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:18.070
 8 - pin right 2004 pedro majority 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.770
 even simpler boards are 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.560
 only four pins 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.229
 here are two more people than me 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.690
 I think I was going to tell you all and all. 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.880
 the capacitors here are 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:34.520
 that brings a better mother 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.830
 plate efficiency but is it right there 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.590
 I hope you have enjoyed it and even 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.979
 our next video see then spoke and 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.979
 even U.S
