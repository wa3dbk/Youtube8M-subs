00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
on battlefield now this level was the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.400 
on battlefield now this level was the
main<00:00:08.340> reason<00:00:08.639> why<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> waited<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.450> get<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> rest

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
main reason why I waited to get the rest

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
main reason why I waited to get the rest
of<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> start<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.219> Bob<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.550> battlefield

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
of the start here in Bob on battlefield

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.440 
of the start here in Bob on battlefield
until<00:00:12.809> after<00:00:13.230> doing<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.009> wing<00:00:14.519> cap<00:00:14.849> switch

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
until after doing the wing cap switch

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.160 
until after doing the wing cap switch
level<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.880> that's<00:00:17.880> because<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.539> actually

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
level and that's because you actually

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980 
level and that's because you actually
need<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> wing<00:00:19.619> cap<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.340> level<00:00:20.990> another

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
need the wing cap for this level another

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.480 
need the wing cap for this level another
thing<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.230> need<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> cannons<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.340> make

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
thing you need to is the cannons to make

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.220 
thing you need to is the cannons to make
sure<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.760> talk<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> me<00:00:24.210> Bob<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.869> activate

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
sure you talk to me Bob all to activate

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
sure you talk to me Bob all to activate
those<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:26.039> president<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> hadn't<00:00:26.820> done<00:00:26.970> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
those as president I hadn't done that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.450 
those as president I hadn't done that
yet<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.750> guess<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.010> haven't<00:00:29.310> really

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
yet I guess we just haven't really

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.650 
yet I guess we just haven't really
needed<00:00:29.699> them<00:00:29.789> until<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.300> particularly

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
needed them until this particularly

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.319 
needed them until this particularly
level<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> you're<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> make

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
level so you're going to want to make

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.940 
level so you're going to want to make
your<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> mountain<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
your way up the mountain here kind of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.510 
your way up the mountain here kind of
you<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.460> previous<00:00:36.090> levels<00:00:37.250> however<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.340> do

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you have in previous levels however I do

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.700 
you have in previous levels however I do
want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> mention<00:00:39.030> though<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:40.530> not

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
want to mention though that you do not

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
want to mention though that you do not
want<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> warp<00:00:41.489> point<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.510> my

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
want to use the warp point I know in my

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.709 
want to use the warp point I know in my
previous<00:00:42.960> videos<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.210> big<00:00:45.210> bomb<00:00:45.420> on

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
previous videos for like a big bomb on

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.330 
previous videos for like a big bomb on
the<00:00:45.840> summit<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> footrace<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.980> Koopa<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the summit and footrace with a Koopa to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.069 
the summit and footrace with a Koopa to
quick<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> stuff<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.539> used<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> war

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
quick and stuff I have used the war

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.650 
quick and stuff I have used the war
point<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.280> particular<00:00:50.879> level<00:00:51.570> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
point but in this particular level is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
point but in this particular level is
actually<00:00:52.140> more<00:00:52.350> convenient<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
actually more convenient not to use it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.939 
actually more convenient not to use it
because<00:00:53.730> you'll<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.899> warp<00:00:55.320> past<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.189 

the<00:00:58.949> SC<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.430> don't<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.020> past<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the SC we don't want to do that past the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.060 
the SC we don't want to do that past the
cannon<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:04.650> right

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cannon and because it's actually right

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
cannon and because it's actually right
here<00:01:05.100> around<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> corner<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:07.140> have

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
here around the corner so you would have

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.469 
here around the corner so you would have
passed<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.890> actually<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
passed it up and actually had a

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.219 
passed it up and actually had a
backtrack<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:11.000> um<00:01:12.080> I'm<00:01:13.080> going

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
backtrack to get to it and um I'm going

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.600 
backtrack to get to it and um I'm going
a<00:01:13.470> m--<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
a m-- right

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.480 
a m-- right
they're<00:01:16.270> approximately<00:01:16.960> more<00:01:17.710> or<00:01:17.770> less<00:01:17.920> to

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
they're approximately more or less to

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.330 
they're approximately more or less to
grab<00:01:18.910> onto<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.180> tree<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.160> wing

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
grab onto that tree and there's a wing

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.810 
grab onto that tree and there's a wing
cap<00:01:21.610> box<00:01:21.940> up<00:01:22.210> here<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:23.250> well<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.580> it's<00:01:24.700> not

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
cap box up here and well this it's not

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.180 
cap box up here and well this it's not
really<00:01:24.970> captain<00:01:25.420> super<00:01:26.110> masks<00:01:26.530> for<00:01:26.740> das<00:01:26.980> it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
really captain super masks for das it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.490 
really captain super masks for das it
wasn't<00:01:27.550> original<00:01:28.090> but<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.930> guess<00:01:29.080> is<00:01:29.200> more<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.440> a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
wasn't original but I guess is more of a

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.130 
wasn't original but I guess is more of a
feather<00:01:29.740> now<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:33.370> once<00:01:34.120> you<00:01:34.210> get<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.570> get

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
feather now so and once you get that get

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.410 
feather now so and once you get that get
into<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.440> Canon<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.010> there<00:01:36.550> are<00:01:36.640> these<00:01:36.760> coin

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
into the Canon and there are these coin

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.210 
into the Canon and there are these coin
rings<00:01:37.630> here<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.990> as<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.230> see<00:01:38.410> they're<00:01:38.770> made

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
rings here and as you see they're made

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.610 
rings here and as you see they're made
up<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.710> ten<00:01:42.130> nine<00:01:42.670> or<00:01:42.910> ten<00:01:43.090> coins<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.750> a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
up of like ten nine or ten coins and a

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.410 
up of like ten nine or ten coins and a
circle<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.280> with<00:01:45.640> one<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.000> middle<00:01:46.300> and

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
circle and with one in the middle and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.270 
circle and with one in the middle and
what<00:01:47.230> you<00:01:47.350> want<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.890> want<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.100> aim

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
what you want to do is you want to aim

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.219 
what you want to do is you want to aim
for<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> middle<00:01:48.760> of<00:01:49.060> those<00:01:49.270> circles<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.080> try

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
for the middle of those circles and try

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.020 
for the middle of those circles and try
to<00:01:50.290> fly<00:01:50.530> through<00:01:50.680> them<00:01:50.830> I'm<00:01:51.130> pretty<00:01:51.490> bad<00:01:51.640> this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
to fly through them I'm pretty bad this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.770 
to fly through them I'm pretty bad this
but<00:01:52.600> better<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.810> got<00:01:53.140> two<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.880> each<00:01:55.390> time<00:01:55.630> you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
but better I got two and each time you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.420 
but better I got two and each time you
go<00:01:55.990> through<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.260> middle<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.740> number<00:01:57.100> will<00:01:57.250> pop

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
go through the middle a number will pop

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.969 
go through the middle a number will pop
up<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.850> there's<00:01:58.270> five<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.600> them<00:01:58.780> once<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.890> do

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
up and there's five of them once you do

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.490 
up and there's five of them once you do
all<00:02:00.010> five<00:02:00.479> star<00:02:01.479> will<00:02:01.660> appear<00:02:01.720> down<00:02:02.140> by<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
all five star will appear down by the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.820 
all five star will appear down by the
where<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.369> red<00:02:03.550> coin<00:02:03.940> star<00:02:04.330> would<00:02:04.540> appear

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
where the red coin star would appear

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.410 
where the red coin star would appear
there's<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.890> few<00:02:06.250> stumps<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:06.940> some<00:02:07.240> green

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
there's a few stumps and some green

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.070 
there's a few stumps and some green
boughs<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:08.260> to<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> left<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
boughs it's to the to the left of the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.550 
boughs it's to the to the left of the
bridge<00:02:11.770> by<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.640> Chain<00:02:13.209> Chomp<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
bridge by the Chain Chomp that like the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.520 
bridge by the Chain Chomp that like the
seesaw<00:02:14.920> bridge<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.600> it's<00:02:17.380> pretty

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
seesaw bridge so that it's pretty

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.990 
seesaw bridge so that it's pretty
convenient<00:02:17.860> because<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.459> pretty

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
convenient because you can just pretty

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.900 
convenient because you can just pretty
much<00:02:19.150> fly<00:02:19.510> down<00:02:19.750> from<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.500> here<00:02:20.820> making<00:02:21.820> it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
much fly down from up here making it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.320 
much fly down from up here making it
pretty<00:02:22.060> quick<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.930> travel<00:02:23.380> there<00:02:23.820> as<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.150> can

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
pretty quick to travel there as you can

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.500 
pretty quick to travel there as you can
see<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.510> kind<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.110> sprung<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.410> little<00:02:26.709> bit<00:02:26.830> here

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
see I kind of sprung a little bit here

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.350 
see I kind of sprung a little bit here
I'm<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.720> too<00:02:28.989> too<00:02:29.980> good<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.310> flying<00:02:30.580> but

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
I'm not too too good at flying but

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.500 
I'm not too too good at flying but
so<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.010> may<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.520> you're<00:02:34.700> you're

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
like me at all may need to make multiple

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.900 
like me at all may need to make multiple
trips<00:02:37.760> which<00:02:38.570> isn't<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.900> problem<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.790> know

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
trips which isn't a problem you know

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.690 
trips which isn't a problem you know
just<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.350> should<00:02:42.410> be<00:02:42.710> able<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.010> have<00:02:43.430> enough

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
just you should be able to have enough

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.580 
just you should be able to have enough
more<00:02:44.300> than<00:02:44.330> enough<00:02:44.450> elevation<00:02:45.140> from<00:02:45.290> shooting

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
more than enough elevation from shooting

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.410 
more than enough elevation from shooting
out<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.890> cannon<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.490> get<00:02:46.940> back<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.300> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
out of the cannon to get back to the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.400 
out of the cannon to get back to the
island

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
island

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.600 
island
there<00:02:48.590> we<00:02:48.650> go<00:02:48.740> that's<00:02:48.830> number<00:02:49.070> four<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.460> just

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
there we go that's number four so I just

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.680 
there we go that's number four so I just
need<00:02:49.730> one<00:02:49.970> more<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:51.670> also<00:02:52.670> when<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.180> when<00:02:53.660> I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
need one more and also when I when I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.380 
need one more and also when I when I
come<00:02:53.870> back<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.230> island<00:02:54.380> I'd<00:02:54.740> like<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.390> hit

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
come back to the island I'd like to hit

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.720 
come back to the island I'd like to hit
that<00:02:56.570> box<00:02:56.870> again<00:02:57.080> just<00:02:57.800> because<00:02:57.950> if<00:02:58.310> you're

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that box again just because if you're

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.210 
that box again just because if you're
not<00:02:58.880> careful<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.570> can<00:02:59.870> there's<00:03:00.770> like<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.890> timer

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
not careful it can there's like a timer

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.120 
not careful it can there's like a timer
on<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.780> wing<00:03:02.780> cap<00:03:03.020> that<00:03:03.230> will<00:03:03.530> eventually<00:03:03.710> run

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
on the wing cap that will eventually run

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.080 
on the wing cap that will eventually run
out<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:05.320> just<00:03:06.320> barely<00:03:06.770> missed<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.220> there<00:03:07.400> so

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
out and just barely missed it there so

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.550 
out and just barely missed it there so
you<00:03:08.150> don't<00:03:08.480> want<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.810> run<00:03:08.930> out<00:03:09.080> pull<00:03:09.350> here

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
you don't want it to run out pull here

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.990 
you don't want it to run out pull here
in<00:03:09.650> midair<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.130> like<00:03:10.280> fall<00:03:10.520> down<00:03:10.700> there<00:03:10.880> and

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
in midair and like fall down there and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.920 
in midair and like fall down there and
have<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.270> all<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.450> way<00:03:11.540> up<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> mountain

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
have to go all the way up the mountain

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.440 
have to go all the way up the mountain
and<00:03:12.200> stuff<00:03:12.440> again<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:15.590> shouldn't<00:03:15.980> be<00:03:16.190> a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
and stuff again but that shouldn't be a

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.600 
and stuff again but that shouldn't be a
real<00:03:17.450> problem<00:03:18.130> we<00:03:19.130> said<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.370> wouldn't

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
real problem we said you wouldn't

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.130 
real problem we said you wouldn't
necessarily<00:03:19.790> need<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.390> every<00:03:20.600> time<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
necessarily need to do it every time I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.740 
necessarily need to do it every time I
just<00:03:21.290> do<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.590> because<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:22.160> don't<00:03:22.850> know<00:03:23.030> stead<00:03:23.720> of

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
just do it because I don't know stead of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.460 
just do it because I don't know stead of
caution<00:03:24.740> but<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.900> could<00:03:27.050> really<00:03:27.170> probably

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
caution but you could really probably

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.770 
caution but you could really probably
make<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.740> two<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:28.640> maybe<00:03:28.970> even<00:03:29.120> three<00:03:29.300> trips

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
make a two or maybe even three trips

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.770 
make a two or maybe even three trips
with<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.110> with<00:03:30.800> just<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:34.510> yeah<00:03:35.510> so

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
with it with just one and yeah so

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.150 
with it with just one and yeah so
usually<00:03:36.320> like<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.830> just<00:03:36.980> think<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:37.970> dude<00:03:38.390> ah

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
usually like you just think that dude ah

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.330 
usually like you just think that dude ah

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
nope why so I was just a little under

nope why so I was just a little under
there<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.720> just<00:03:45.110> basically<00:03:46.660> because

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
there so just basically because

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.470 
there so just basically because
initially<00:03:48.080> what<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.230> tried<00:03:48.680> was<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.850> regular

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
initially what I tried was just regular

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.420 
initially what I tried was just regular
like<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.260> didn't<00:03:51.680> move<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.890> Cannonball

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
like I didn't move the Cannonball

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.490 
like I didn't move the Cannonball

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
however you want to open Marek's I got

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.050 
however you want to open Marek's I got
on<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.680> way<00:03:57.769> back<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.160> as<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:58.700> see<00:03:58.880> you'll

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
on the way back and as you see you'll

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.100 
on the way back and as you see you'll
peer<00:03:59.480> down<00:03:59.660> there

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
peer down there

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.890 
peer down there
you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.440> see<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.830> on<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.100> bottom<00:04:01.459> screen<00:04:01.900> but

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
you can see it on the bottom screen but

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.520 
you can see it on the bottom screen but
um

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.600 

probably<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.590> best<00:04:06.739> result<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.310> get<00:04:07.459> that

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
probably the best result to get that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.970 
probably the best result to get that
last<00:04:07.849> one<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.540> aim<00:04:08.810> just<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:09.200> little<00:04:09.590> above

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
last one is to aim just a little above

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.509 
last one is to aim just a little above
the<00:04:10.189> default<00:04:10.909> bang<00:04:11.450> on<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:11.989> cannon<00:04:12.560> but

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
the default bang on that cannon but

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.330 
the default bang on that cannon but
that's<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:14.659> one<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.590> hard<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:16.100> could<00:04:16.190> be<00:04:16.250> a

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
that's it so one to hard it could be a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.129 
that's it so one to hard it could be a
little<00:04:16.609> tedious<00:04:16.820> having<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.299> go<00:04:17.449> over<00:04:17.989> and

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
little tedious having to go over and

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.340 
little tedious having to go over and
over<00:04:18.260> again<00:04:18.579> but<00:04:19.579> um<00:04:19.790> really<00:04:20.479> isn't<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.690> bad

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
over again but um really isn't that bad

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.010 
over again but um really isn't that bad
so<00:04:21.739> um<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.910> next<00:04:23.120> star<00:04:23.270> we'll<00:04:23.419> be<00:04:23.510> doing<00:04:23.810> will
