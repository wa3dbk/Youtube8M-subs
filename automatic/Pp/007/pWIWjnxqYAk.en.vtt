are shaded blue for what I recall

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.009 
are shaded blue for what I recall
instead<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.570> making<00:03:21.260> them<00:03:21.350> shaded<00:03:21.829> black<00:03:22.519> and

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019

depth<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.780> made<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.170> look<00:03:33.200> more

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
depth and made it look more

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.319 
depth and made it look more
three-dimensional<00:03:36.100> let's<00:03:37.100> see<00:03:37.430> what<00:03:38.299> else

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
that they didn't really get down to

Captain Britain and there's only maybe a

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
floating around which is actually

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.740 
floating around which is actually
considered<00:06:27.990> a<00:06:28.319> prototype<00:06:28.949> so<00:06:29.460> if<00:06:30.389> you<00:06:30.509> happen

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
considered a prototype so if you happen

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.579

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:34.589 
to see that that usually means they got

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.790 
to see that that usually means they got
a<00:06:34.620> prototype<00:06:35.159> in<00:06:35.370> their<00:06:35.909> hands<00:06:36.800> alright

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
a prototype in their hands alright
