Deauville is a beer that has rieflin
tation<00:00:24.310> in<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.609> bottle<00:00:25.000> so<00:00:25.810> we're<00:00:26.349> going<00:00:26.590> to

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
tation in the bottle so we're going to

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.560 
tation in the bottle so we're going to
start<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.580> pour<00:00:27.910> as<00:00:28.150> usual<00:00:28.720> without<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.740> e<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
start to pour as usual without the e the

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.800 
start to pour as usual without the e the
reason<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.470> we<00:00:33.100> make<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:34.240> one<00:00:34.480> who<00:00:34.750> is

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
reason is that we make the one who is

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.170 
reason is that we make the one who is
going<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.140> drink<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.740> Deauville<00:00:36.130> choose<00:00:36.790> for

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
going to drink the Deauville choose for

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.300 
going to drink the Deauville choose for
themselves<00:00:37.360> whether<00:00:38.140> he<00:00:38.440> wants<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.890> bring<00:00:39.070> the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
themselves whether he wants to bring the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.000 
themselves whether he wants to bring the
heat<00:00:39.490> with<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:40.150> diesel<00:00:40.510> or<00:00:40.720> not<00:00:40.960> it<00:00:41.500> gives<00:00:41.830> a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
heat with the diesel or not it gives a

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.540 
heat with the diesel or not it gives a
bit<00:00:42.190> bitter<00:00:42.580> taste<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:44.500> has<00:00:44.950> a<00:00:44.980> bit<00:00:45.310> of<00:00:45.340> a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
bit bitter taste and it has a bit of a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.930 
bit bitter taste and it has a bit of a
stimulating<00:00:46.360> effect<00:00:46.600> coming<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.470> lesson

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
stimulating effect coming in the lesson

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.630 
stimulating effect coming in the lesson
for<00:00:48.940> that<00:00:49.210> is<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.750> reason<00:00:50.140> now<00:00:50.950> because

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
for that is the reason now because

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.220 
for that is the reason now because
they're<00:00:51.850> dipped<00:00:52.120> in<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.420> bubble<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.810> have<00:00:53.080> to

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
they're dipped in a bubble you have to

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.380 
they're dipped in a bubble you have to
keep<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.560> bottle<00:00:53.920> standing<00:00:54.400> straight<00:00:54.880> up<00:00:54.910> or

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
keep the bottle standing straight up or

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.540 
keep the bottle standing straight up or
wait<00:00:55.750> so<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.260> yeast<00:00:56.470> might<00:00:56.830> think<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
wait so the yeast might think to the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.030 
wait so the yeast might think to the
bottom<00:00:57.970> yes<00:00:58.360> we're<00:00:59.350> going<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.770> open<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.280> and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
bottom yes we're going to open it and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.510 
bottom yes we're going to open it and
then<00:01:03.040> we're<00:01:03.550> going<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.000> pour<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:06.250> a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
then we're going to pour out in a

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.279 
then we're going to pour out in a
graciously<00:01:07.329> flowing<00:01:08.109> movement<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:10.289> don't

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
graciously flowing movement one don't

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.980 
graciously flowing movement one don't
make<00:01:11.979> too<00:01:12.310> much<00:01:13.920> movements<00:01:14.920> like<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:15.990> don't

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
make too much movements like this don't

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.410 
make too much movements like this don't
add<00:01:17.289> more<00:01:17.829> beer<00:01:18.159> into<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.759> same<00:01:19.060> glass

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
add more beer into the same glass

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.510 
add more beer into the same glass
because<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.109> more<00:01:20.499> movement<00:01:21.039> you<00:01:21.249> make

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
because the more movement you make

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.239 
because the more movement you make
during<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.329> pouring<00:01:22.749> out<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.439> more<00:01:23.649> carbon

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
during the pouring out the more carbon

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.630 
during the pouring out the more carbon
dioxide<00:01:24.280> will<00:01:25.270> be<00:01:25.450> pushed<00:01:25.929> upward<00:01:26.469> that's<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
dioxide will be pushed upward that's the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.609 
dioxide will be pushed upward that's the
way<00:01:27.789> you<00:01:27.850> make<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.600> beer<00:01:28.869> more<00:01:29.289> difficult

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
way you make the beer more difficult

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.830 
way you make the beer more difficult
and<00:01:30.799> might<00:01:31.189> give<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.670> little<00:01:31.820> feeling<00:01:32.720> in

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and might give you a little feeling in

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.460 
and might give you a little feeling in
the<00:01:32.930> stomach<00:01:32.990> or<00:01:33.619> even<00:01:34.130> headaches<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.600> that's

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
the stomach or even headaches so that's

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.859 
the stomach or even headaches so that's
the<00:01:36.710> reason<00:01:37.130> why<00:01:37.399> we<00:01:37.640> do<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.939> in<00:01:38.210> one<00:01:38.479> grade

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
the reason why we do it in one grade

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.410 
the reason why we do it in one grade
going<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.970> start<00:01:41.270> like<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:42.970> we<00:01:43.970> make<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
going we start like this we make the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.510 
going we start like this we make the
beer<00:01:44.600> slide<00:01:45.049> along<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.710> edge<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.310> glass

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
beer slide along the edge of the glass

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.660 
beer slide along the edge of the glass
to<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.060> bottom<00:01:47.420> don't<00:01:48.200> touch<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.100> glass<00:01:49.250> on

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
to the bottom don't touch the glass on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.480 
to the bottom don't touch the glass on
the<00:01:49.789> bottle<00:01:50.740> when<00:01:51.740> it's<00:01:51.920> filled<00:01:52.189> for<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
the bottle when it's filled for the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.760 
the bottle when it's filled for the
heart<00:01:52.789> we<00:01:53.090> straighten<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.810> glass<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.439> we

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
heart we straighten the glass and we

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.109 
heart we straighten the glass and we
start<00:01:55.130> pouring<00:01:55.640> out<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.570> middle<00:01:56.929> of<00:01:57.140> it

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
start pouring out in the middle of it

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.410 
start pouring out in the middle of it
that's<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.360> way<00:01:59.539> we<00:01:59.750> go<00:01:59.990> on<00:02:00.229> until<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:02.060> stop

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's the way we go on until we stop

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.919 
that's the way we go on until we stop
about<00:02:03.409> one<00:02:03.740> centimeter<00:02:04.100> from<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.119> edge<00:02:05.299> of

can see happening here is that there are
some<00:02:47.880> there<00:02:48.630> are<00:02:48.660> some<00:02:48.870> bubbles<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.740> carbon

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
some there are some bubbles of carbon

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.090 
some there are some bubbles of carbon
dioxide<00:02:50.489> gas<00:02:51.090> escaping<00:02:52.040> now<00:02:54.650> proteins<00:02:55.650> will

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
dioxide gas escaping now proteins will

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.760 
dioxide gas escaping now proteins will
stick<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.730> those<00:02:56.910> well<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.570> that's<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.560> way

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
stick to those well and that's the way

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.920 
stick to those well and that's the way
we<00:02:58.980> keep<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.459> foam<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.660> bit

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
we keep the foam and it's a little bit

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.740 
we keep the foam and it's a little bit
longer<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.530> top<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> beer<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:03.209> reason<00:03:03.630> is

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
longer on top of the beer the reason is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.190 
longer on top of the beer the reason is
that<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:05.250> phone<00:03:05.550> protect<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.480> good<00:03:06.720> case<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
that the phone protect the good case of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.810 
that the phone protect the good case of
the<00:03:07.320> beer<00:03:07.530> against<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.550> influence<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.300> oxygen

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
the beer against the influence of oxygen

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.150 
the beer against the influence of oxygen
british<00:03:11.820> people<00:03:12.030> don't<00:03:12.450> care<00:03:12.750> about<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.080> we<00:03:13.950> do

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
british people don't care about it we do

british people don't care about it we do
for<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.880> reason<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.380> alcohol

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
for that reason the more alcohol

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.670 
for that reason the more alcohol
percentage<00:03:17.220> there<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.300> beer

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
percentage there is in the beer

percentage there is in the beer
the<00:03:18.769> more<00:03:18.980> phone<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:19.640> give<00:03:19.909> it<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.299> start<00:03:21.879> now

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
the more phone we give it to start now

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.619 
the more phone we give it to start now
the<00:03:24.260> escapement<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.370> carbon<00:03:25.849> dioxide<00:03:25.879> gap

the escapement of the carbon dioxide gap
what<00:03:27.079> gas<00:03:27.409> bubbles<00:03:27.920> will<00:03:28.250> keep<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.700> form<00:03:28.970> a

what gas bubbles will keep the form a
