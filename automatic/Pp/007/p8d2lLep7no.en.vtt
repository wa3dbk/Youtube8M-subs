00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
again to arm the system see it beats now

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.990 
again to arm the system see it beats now
watch<00:03:09.590> step<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.739> pressure<00:03:10.860> plate<00:03:14.000> goes

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
watch step on the pressure plate goes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.809 
watch step on the pressure plate goes
off<00:03:15.239> now<00:03:15.450> let<00:03:15.690> me<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.280> turn<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.430> thing<00:03:17.489> up

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
off now let me to turn this thing up

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.199 
off now let me to turn this thing up
where<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.060> guys<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.420> hear<00:03:20.090> mom<00:03:21.139> turns<00:03:22.139> up<00:03:22.380> I

where you guys can hear mom turns up I

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.569 
where you guys can hear mom turns up I
yep<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.389> doesn't<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.780> off<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.500> long<00:03:25.650> but

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
yep it doesn't go off for long but

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.979 
yep it doesn't go off for long but
that's<00:03:27.030> kind<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.510> point

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
that's kind of the point

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.780 
that's kind of the point
alright<00:03:28.590> see<00:03:30.500> that's<00:03:31.500> why<00:03:32.069> it's<00:03:32.310> kind<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.609> good

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
alright see that's why it's kind of good

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.160 
alright see that's why it's kind of good
to<00:03:32.910> get<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.299> sound<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:35.849> know<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.660> you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
to get more sound you know more and you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.170 
to get more sound you know more and you
can<00:03:37.319> put<00:03:37.470> more<00:03:37.590> pressure<00:03:37.799> plates<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.730> arm<00:03:38.970> it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
can put more pressure plates to arm it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.270 
can put more pressure plates to arm it
more<00:03:40.139> indigo<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.620> increase<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.099> range<00:03:41.280> so

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
more indigo and increase the range so

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.280 
more indigo and increase the range so
like<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.459> shown<00:03:44.669> here<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.959> put<00:03:46.200> it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
like it's shown here you can put it

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.259 
like it's shown here you can put it
right<00:03:46.319> here<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.799> let's<00:03:46.950> say<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:47.160> had<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> block

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
right here and let's say you had a block

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.490 
right here and let's say you had a block
right<00:03:48.480> here<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.810> could<00:03:48.930> place<00:03:49.169> another

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
right here you could place another

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.030 
right here you could place another
pressure<00:03:49.799> plate<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:51.079> then<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.500> can<00:03:52.650> dig<00:03:52.829> down

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
pressure plate and then you can dig down

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.970 
pressure plate and then you can dig down
some<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.930> get<00:03:54.930> your<00:03:55.139> redstone<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.799> this

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
some and get your redstone going this

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.089 
some and get your redstone going this
way<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:57.139> place<00:03:58.139> another<00:03:58.410> pressure<00:03:58.739> plate<00:03:58.980> you

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
way and place another pressure plate you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.909 
way and place another pressure plate you
can<00:03:59.250> price<00:03:59.430> as<00:03:59.639> many<00:03:59.940> as<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.299> want<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.709> see

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
can price as many as you want and see

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.970 
can price as many as you want and see
any<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.549> them<00:04:02.669> will<00:04:02.819> work<00:04:02.849> that<00:04:03.450> one<00:04:03.599> will<00:04:03.690> work

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
any of them will work that one will work

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.260 
any of them will work that one will work
any<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.250> them<00:04:05.370> would<00:04:05.459> work<00:04:05.700> that's<00:04:06.630> one<00:04:07.260> more

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.400 

all<00:04:11.270> right<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.630> that's<00:04:11.840> basically<00:04:12.170> how<00:04:12.350> you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
all right so that's basically how you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.770 
all right so that's basically how you
make<00:04:12.590> an<00:04:12.709> alarm<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.160> Minecraft<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:13.910> mean<00:04:14.630> you

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780
