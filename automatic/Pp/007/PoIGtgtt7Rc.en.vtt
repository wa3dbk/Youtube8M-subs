00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
all right this is the Marlow tilt this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 
all right this is the Marlow tilt this
is<00:00:26.850> a<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.210> unique<00:00:27.450> way<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:28.200> controlling<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
is a really unique way of controlling a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.310 
is a really unique way of controlling a
card<00:00:29.100> it<00:00:29.820> looks<00:00:30.180> like<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.170> taking

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
card it looks like you're just taking

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.840 
card it looks like you're just taking
their<00:00:31.590> card<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.920> sticking<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.580> the<00:00:32.640> middle

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
their card and sticking it in the middle

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.979 
their card and sticking it in the middle
of<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.059> deck<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.629> what's<00:00:33.809> actually

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of the deck but what's actually

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.680 
of the deck but what's actually
happening<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.370> create<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.300> depth

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
happening is you create this depth

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
happening is you create this depth
illusion<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:38.129> card<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.430> actually<00:00:38.670> being

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
illusion and that card is actually being

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.710 
illusion and that card is actually being
placed<00:00:39.449> second<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.470> top<00:00:41.000> okay<00:00:42.000> so

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
placed second from the top okay so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.460 
placed second from the top okay so
here's<00:00:43.290> how<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> works<00:00:44.329> let's<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
here's how it works let's you have that

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.720 
here's how it works let's you have that
selected<00:00:46.829> card<00:00:47.040> or<00:00:47.190> whatever<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> card

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
selected card or whatever the card

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.680 
selected card or whatever the card
you're<00:00:47.850> trying<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> control<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:49.130> you're

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
you're trying to control as you're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
you're trying to control as you're
grabbing<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.860> you're

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
grabbing it back from them or as you're

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
grabbing it back from them or as you're
showing<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> them<00:00:53.700> here's<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.630> do

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
showing it to them here's what you do

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.470 
showing it to them here's what you do
you<00:00:55.050> push<00:00:55.470> over<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> top<00:00:55.950> card<00:00:56.130> of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> deck

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
you push over the top card of the deck

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.910 
you push over the top card of the deck
you<00:00:57.480> pull<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:58.020> you're<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.500> getting<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you pull back you're just getting a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.360 
you pull back you're just getting a
little<00:00:59.070> pinky<00:00:59.430> break<00:00:59.610> above<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.710> below

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
little pinky break above that or below

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.400 
little pinky break above that or below
that<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:02.730> card<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> should<00:01:03.210> say<00:01:03.390> okay<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.290> now

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
that top card I should say okay but now

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.600 
that top card I should say okay but now
you're<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.770> modify<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> break<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you're going to modify the break a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.889 
you're going to modify the break a
little<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:05.940> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> normal<00:01:06.570> break

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
little bit this is what the normal break

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.510 
little bit this is what the normal break
would<00:01:07.050> look<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.340> from

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
would look like you're going to go from

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
would look like you're going to go from
here<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:11.149> okay<00:01:12.149> so<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> break<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
here to here okay so the break is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
here to here okay so the break is
actually<00:01:13.880> or<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> card<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.300> separated<00:01:15.840> from

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
actually or the card is separated from

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.880 
actually or the card is separated from
the<00:01:16.020> deck<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.610> both<00:01:17.610> sides<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.659> pack<00:01:18.890> okay

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the deck on both sides of the pack okay

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
the deck on both sides of the pack okay
so<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.760> do<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.690> where

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so how I do that here is this is where

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050 
so how I do that here is this is where
the<00:01:21.930> normal<00:01:22.200> break<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.820> doing

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the normal break is like all I'm doing

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
the normal break is like all I'm doing
is<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.630> releasing<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.979> grip<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is I'm kind of just releasing my grip of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.179 
is I'm kind of just releasing my grip of
the<00:01:26.549> deck<00:01:27.290> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> heel<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:28.890> thumb

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the deck kind of at the heel of my thumb

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.620 
the deck kind of at the heel of my thumb
and<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.490> cryed<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.760> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> pop<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.479> little

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and I cryed is going to pop up a little

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
and I cryed is going to pop up a little
bit<00:01:31.159> okay<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.580> play<00:01:32.760> around<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
bit okay just just play around to that a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810 
bit okay just just play around to that a
little<00:01:33.450> bit<00:01:33.570> boom<00:01:34.409> boom<00:01:35.010> whether<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
little bit boom boom whether it's in

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
little bit boom boom whether it's in
there<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.680> basically<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.130> bigger<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
there and basically the bigger this

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.210 
there and basically the bigger this
break<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:40.530> separation<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
break is the the more separation the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.730 
break is the the more separation the
more<00:01:41.400> gap<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:43.049> depth<00:01:43.409> you're

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
more gap there is the more depth you're

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.999 
more gap there is the more depth you're
creating<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> let<00:01:46.290> me<00:01:46.350> let<00:01:46.560> me<00:01:46.619> try<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> with

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
creating so let me let me try that with

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.070 
creating so let me let me try that with
my<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.280> hand<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
my right hand just to see or just so

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.030 
my right hand just to see or just so
that<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:50.009> look

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that you can see what that would look

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.820 
that you can see what that would look
like<00:01:50.189> without<00:01:50.759> practice<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.740> your

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
like without practice so you get your

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.319 
like without practice so you get your
pinky<00:01:53.159> break<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:55.470> here

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
pinky break and you go from here to here

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.600 
pinky break and you go from here to here
okay<00:01:57.329> now<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.310> when<00:01:59.310> you're<00:01:59.430> holding

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
okay now when you when you're holding

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.120 
okay now when you when you're holding
this<00:01:59.880> gap<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.540> guess<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.470> call<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.890> gap

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this gap I guess we call it a gap

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.030 
this gap I guess we call it a gap
instead<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> break<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.060> point<00:02:04.040> there's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
instead of a break at this point there's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.039 
instead of a break at this point there's
a<00:02:05.130> few<00:02:05.430> things<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.689> want<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.900> make<00:02:07.020> sure

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
a few things that you want to make sure

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.430 
a few things that you want to make sure
you<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> make<00:02:09.119> sure<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.540> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you do you want to make sure that the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.000 
you do you want to make sure that the
left<00:02:10.739> edge<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.070> this<00:02:11.190> card<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.730> completely

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
left edge of this card is completely

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.370 
left edge of this card is completely
covered<00:02:14.010> by<00:02:14.190> your<00:02:15.150> thumb<00:02:15.420> by<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.230> heel

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
covered by your thumb by like the heel

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.140 
covered by your thumb by like the heel
of<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.650> thumb<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.489> what<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.910> don't

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
of your thumb you don't what you don't

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.020 
of your thumb you don't what you don't
want<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.540> something<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.880> okay<00:02:20.880> because

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
want is something like this okay because

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.090 
want is something like this okay because
then<00:02:21.329> you're<00:02:21.780> angles<00:02:22.380> are<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.650> bad<00:02:22.769> people

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
then you're angles are really bad people

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.750 
then you're angles are really bad people
are<00:02:23.160> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> see<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.609> separation<00:02:24.030> but

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
are going to see the separation but

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.300 
are going to see the separation but
if<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.390> keep<00:02:25.629> it<00:02:25.840> aligned<00:02:26.560> with<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:27.159> leave

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
if you keep it aligned with you leave

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.210 
if you keep it aligned with you leave
your<00:02:27.459> thumb<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:28.420> your<00:02:29.140> angles<00:02:29.500> are<00:02:29.590> good<00:02:29.739> some

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
your thumb now your angles are good some

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.680 
your thumb now your angles are good some
people<00:02:30.519> still<00:02:30.730> might<00:02:30.940> see<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.269> from<00:02:31.450> this

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
people still might see it from this

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.960 
people still might see it from this
angle<00:02:31.750> right<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:32.950> what<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.159> do<00:02:33.220> there<00:02:33.489> is<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.730> kind

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
angle right so what I do there is I kind

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.289 
angle right so what I do there is I kind
of<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.180> tilt<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.450> hand<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.659> little<00:02:34.959> bit<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
of just tilt my hand a little bit to the

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.630 
of just tilt my hand a little bit to the
right<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:38.110> instead<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.040> doing<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.580> do

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
right so instead of doing like this I do

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.309 
right so instead of doing like this I do
a<00:02:39.730> little<00:02:39.940> bit<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.959> angles<00:02:41.260> on

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
a little bit like this so the angles on

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.860 
a little bit like this so the angles on
this<00:02:41.410> are<00:02:41.560> actually<00:02:41.860> very<00:02:42.129> good<00:02:42.190> okay<00:02:42.879> at<00:02:43.480> this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
this are actually very good okay at this

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.140 
this are actually very good okay at this
point<00:02:44.140> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.349> take<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> card<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.099> what<00:02:46.090> I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
point going to take the card and what I

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.670 
point going to take the card and what I
do<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.540> pretend<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> struggle<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
do is I pretend to struggle just a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.050 
do is I pretend to struggle just a
little<00:02:47.950> bit<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.310> know<00:02:48.340> trying<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> find<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
little bit you know trying to find the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.119 
little bit you know trying to find the
right<00:02:49.209> spot<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.629> put<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.049> but<00:02:50.680> eventually<00:02:50.920> I

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
right spot to put it in but eventually I

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.600 
right spot to put it in but eventually I
just<00:02:51.370> stick<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.670> right<00:02:51.849> underneath<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:54.400> top

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
just stick it right underneath the top

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.780 
just stick it right underneath the top
card<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.409> now<00:02:56.409> from<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> back<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.549> looks

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
card and now from the back this looks

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.229 
card and now from the back this looks
pretty<00:02:58.890> obvious<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:00.370> from<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.640> front<00:03:00.970> this

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
pretty obvious but from the front this

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.509 
pretty obvious but from the front this
actually<00:03:01.930> creates<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.349> really<00:03:02.890> good<00:03:03.069> illusion

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
actually creates a really good illusion

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.880 
actually creates a really good illusion
that<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.790> card<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.090> going<00:03:04.239> dead<00:03:04.540> center<00:03:04.989> okay

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that that card is going dead center okay

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.220 
that that card is going dead center okay
you<00:03:06.459> saw<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:06.940> demo<00:03:07.209> video<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.140> go

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you saw it in the demo video you can go

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.979 
you saw it in the demo video you can go
back<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.560> check<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.829> out<00:03:08.920> again<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.750> here's<00:03:10.930> a

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
back and check it out again but here's a

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.380 
back and check it out again but here's a
few<00:03:11.200> extra<00:03:11.859> subtleties<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.730> can<00:03:12.879> add<00:03:13.120> to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
few extra subtleties that you can add to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.809 
few extra subtleties that you can add to
this<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.660> make<00:03:13.780> illusion<00:03:14.230> even<00:03:14.440> better<00:03:14.819> okay

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
this to make illusion even better okay

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.729 
this to make illusion even better okay
so<00:03:15.849> I<00:03:16.030> already<00:03:16.299> talked<00:03:17.049> about<00:03:17.140> tilting<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
so I already talked about tilting the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.080 
so I already talked about tilting the
hand<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> little<00:03:18.040> bit<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.459> another

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
hand a little bit like this another

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.900 
hand a little bit like this another
thing<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.959> instead<00:03:20.319> of<00:03:20.980> sliding

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
thing you can do is instead of sliding

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.539 
thing you can do is instead of sliding
it<00:03:22.150> straight<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.629> if<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.620> add<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> little<00:03:24.400> bit

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
it straight in if you add a little bit

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.500 
it straight in if you add a little bit
of<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.790> bend<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.019> card<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:28.030> instead<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.299> this

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
of a bend to the card so instead of this

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.440 
of a bend to the card so instead of this
you<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:30.280> enhance<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.209> illusion

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
you do this that enhance the illusion

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.150 
you do this that enhance the illusion
even<00:03:31.870> more<00:03:32.079> try<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.470> out<00:03:32.590> for<00:03:32.739> yourself<00:03:33.040> in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
even more try it out for yourself in

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.069 
even more try it out for yourself in
front<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.459> mirror<00:03:33.609> which<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.720> banned<00:03:34.930> it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
front of a mirror which is banned it

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.240 
front of a mirror which is banned it
makes<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.440> look<00:03:35.620> like<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.889> card<00:03:36.099> is<00:03:36.220> going

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
makes it look like the card is going

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.789 
makes it look like the card is going
even<00:03:36.669> deeper<00:03:36.700> in<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.150> deck<00:03:37.359> okay<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.620> then

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
even deeper in the deck okay and then

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.379 
even deeper in the deck okay and then
you're<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.099> going<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.310> very<00:03:39.639> slowly<00:03:39.819> push<00:03:40.209> it

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
you're just going to very slowly push it

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.409 
you're just going to very slowly push it
all<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.200> way<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.560> once<00:03:42.489> it's<00:03:42.639> in<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:43.000> collapse

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
all the way in once it's in you collapse

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.289 
all the way in once it's in you collapse
the<00:03:43.840> gap<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.440> I'll<00:03:45.430> usually<00:03:45.669> just<00:03:46.000> do<00:03:46.090> like<00:03:46.239> a

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
the gap and I'll usually just do like a

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.199 
the gap and I'll usually just do like a
little<00:03:46.450> dribble<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:47.019> reinforce<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.760> illusion

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
little dribble to reinforce the illusion

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.000 
little dribble to reinforce the illusion
that<00:03:49.299> it's<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.599> middle<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.959> pack<00:03:50.169> and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
that it's in the middle of the pack and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.940 
that it's in the middle of the pack and
that's<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:52.000> at<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:52.840> point<00:03:53.109> their<00:03:53.319> card<00:03:53.590> or
