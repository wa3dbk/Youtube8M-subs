you you realize the technique and that's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.749 
you you realize the technique and that's
what<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.770> least<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.369> happened<00:02:02.640> with

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

me<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.780> yeah<00:02:03.930> i<00:02:03.960> recommend<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
me but yeah i recommend the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.430 
me but yeah i recommend the
between<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.840> lashes<00:02:06.840> yeah<00:02:07.170> they're

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
between one lashes yeah they're

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.340 
between one lashes yeah they're
synthetic<00:02:08.040> over<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.580> verb<00:02:08.930> but<00:02:09.930> they're<00:02:10.140> also

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
synthetic over the verb but they're also

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.020 
synthetic over the verb but they're also
easier<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> clean<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.550> their<00:02:11.850> synthetic

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
easier to clean because their synthetic

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.300
