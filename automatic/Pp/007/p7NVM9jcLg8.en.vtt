I a couple of these I have a lot of
these<00:00:56.559> relays<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.370> got<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.520> bunch<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:58.079> terminal

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
these relays I got a bunch of terminal

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.799 
these relays I got a bunch of terminal
blocks<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.370> i'll<00:01:01.270> get<00:01:01.449> more<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.720> that

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
blocks but i'll get more to that

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.930 
blocks but i'll get more to that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
wires right there and they all branch

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.380 
wires right there and they all branch
out<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> different<00:01:35.080> things<00:01:35.940> again<00:01:36.940> here's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
you see this kind of home wiring at the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.109 
you see this kind of home wiring at the
tunngle<00:01:51.729> boards<00:01:52.350> they're<00:01:53.350> going<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.890> have

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
tunngle boards they're going to have

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.949 
tunngle boards they're going to have
these<00:01:55.470> wire<00:01:56.470> colors<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.340> each<00:01:57.369> one<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.970> this

these wire colors in each one and this

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.910 
these wire colors in each one and this
is<00:01:59.259> going<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.649> be<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> harness<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:01.800> more<00:02:02.800> the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
is going to be a harness a more the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.990 
is going to be a harness a more the
engine<00:02:03.220> bay<00:02:03.340> do<00:02:04.240> things<00:02:04.479> like<00:02:04.720> this<00:02:04.959> so<00:02:05.259> i<00:02:06.000> got

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
engine bay do things like this so i got

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.690 
engine bay do things like this so i got
my<00:02:07.170> turning<00:02:08.170> signals<00:02:08.560> right<00:02:08.860> here<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.550> it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
my turning signals right here and it's

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.059 
my turning signals right here and it's
the<00:02:09.789> female<00:02:10.179> adapter<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.840> then<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.500> male<00:02:11.770> is

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the female adapter and then the male is

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.910 
the female adapter and then the male is
the<00:02:12.810> headlights<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.170> i<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.830> both

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
the dash harness taped up that was a bit

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.140 
the dash harness taped up that was a bit
of<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.120> pain<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.330> do<00:03:16.600> but<00:03:17.470> now<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.580> zetha<00:03:18.880> cut<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
wires and I'm going to mock it up in my

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.560 
wires and I'm going to mock it up in my
almost<00:03:23.200> done<00:03:24.150> dash<00:03:25.150> which<00:03:25.390> I've<00:03:25.540> been

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
I've done so far kind of mocked up the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.980 
I've done so far kind of mocked up the
terminal<00:04:01.810> bored<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.140> making<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.760> have<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.750> two

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
one harness from the back of the car

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.200 
one harness from the back of the car
going<00:04:09.310> into<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.460> other<00:04:12.610> side<00:04:12.910> is

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
going into it and on the other side is

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.150 
going into it and on the other side is
going<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.630> be<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.840> relays<00:04:14.170> in<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.560> fuse<00:04:15.280> block

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
going to be the relays in the fuse block

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.580 
going to be the relays in the fuse block
and<00:04:18.160> then<00:04:18.280> over<00:04:18.670> here<00:04:20.640> started<00:04:21.640> wiring<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.210> the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and then over here started wiring up the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.200 
and then over here started wiring up the
dash<00:04:23.590> for<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.920> most<00:04:24.190> part<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:26.910> do<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.940> little

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
dash for the most part and do a little

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.170 
dash for the most part and do a little
things<00:04:29.910> like<00:04:30.910> this<00:04:32.430> adding<00:04:33.430> nice<00:04:33.670> terminals

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
things like this adding nice terminals

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.510 
things like this adding nice terminals
to<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.420> back<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.690> these<00:04:34.780> things<00:04:35.250> which<00:04:36.250> looks

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
to the back of these things which looks

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.070 
to the back of these things which looks
way<00:04:36.850> better<00:04:39.210> only<00:04:40.210> thing<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.450> don't<00:04:40.510> like<00:04:40.960> is

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
way better only thing I don't like is

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.070 
way better only thing I don't like is
hazard<00:04:44.080> switch<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:44.440> going<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.650> be<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.740> pain<00:04:46.080> and

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
hazard switch is going to be a pain and

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.680 
hazard switch is going to be a pain and
a<00:04:47.260> couple<00:04:47.440> things<00:04:47.710> with<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.690> windshield

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
a couple things with the windshield

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.800 
a couple things with the windshield
washer<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.800> relay<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.820> everything<00:04:52.150> it's<00:04:52.390> not

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810

wired<00:04:53.110> up<00:04:53.350> like<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.280> wiring<00:04:54.580> diagram<00:04:54.940> at<00:04:55.030> all

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
wired up like the wiring diagram at all

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.930 
wired up like the wiring diagram at all
and<00:04:55.720> i'm<00:04:56.380> not<00:04:56.620> sure<00:04:56.680> how<00:04:57.100> I'm<00:04:57.220> going<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.520> tackle
