00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello this is a fresh news release from 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.799
 parcels billion dollars in space 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.780
 google wants to throw out a whole space 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.210
 billion dollars and for such costs 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 I expect to dig connection with the development of ideas 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.299
 Internet the most inaccessible places 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 planet earth 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 it is clear because google is like no one 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.760
 the other knows how important each is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 user clicking on adware 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.789
 ad billion will invest 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 psx company owned by ilon mask 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 CEO Tesla Mask for 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 space their task is next he wants 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 send cosmos rockets as much as possible 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 Cheap so cheap to almost 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.219
 any man from earth could 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.590
 travel on space 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.840
 space in google decided that if 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.730
 the masses will make their way and gratuitous 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.870
 satellites will start to leave steadily 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 atmosphere limits 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 then they can be used for 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.710
 Internet transmissions across the globe 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.170
 which means even more people will be able to see 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.800
 advertising moreover the internet can become 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 will be paid for free by 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 advertisers sounds it all of course 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 cool that's just and I'm worried that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 Internet advertising can be phrases 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.820
 more more google announced closing 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 eye explorer programs now 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 interfere in someone else's private space 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.200
 will have the old fashioned January 19 points 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 stopped selling but if you are 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 developer or company 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.770
 due to sketched eye purchases then this 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 can be done on special request 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.299
 after closing the eye program completely 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.850
 came from labs x was good 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.430
 google composition as usual 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.290
 the division headed him then did not fall 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.350
 the one who once worked on 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.670
 the first ipod fell out on its own 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.950
 Designed and released 2014 place 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.530
 year was taken over by his team in 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.110
 google so there's a chance he's not 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.390
 will be able to give the eye more commercial 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.710
 zest and will bring to market the product is not 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.320
 simple and graph 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.909
 but really popular besides 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.799
 there is information that the market 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.690
 It will not be the version of which we 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.030
 accustomed to the program of researchers 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.680
 according to some sources a new eye 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.710
 will be much more like 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.729
 classic glasses and look not so 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.429
 futuristic 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.410
 but to have all the usual features 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.160
 sales in the retail market will begin already 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.440
 this year 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.050
 when it is not specified but you can 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.290
 suggest that the market is on the eye version 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.440
 will present at google conference oh oh 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.830
 2015 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 but motorola recognized defective axus 6 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.630
 several nexus 6 owners have applied 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.069
 motorola with a problem back cover them 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.380
 nexus after some time 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.209
 use suddenly disconnected from 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.160
 shell some users 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.260
 say what happens is like 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.870
 increasing battery it only 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.330
 probably getting fat for chocolate 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.220
 squeezed the battery cover 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.260
 acknowledged problems reported received 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.930
 already several reports of this defect 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.000
 as an apology, the company offers 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.400
 replace the device completely free 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.410
 including free shipping to one of 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.440
 users even sent free 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.959
 case in general motorola generosity does not know 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.820
 boundaries yes if it analyzes the situation 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.859
 for what reason can like 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.930
 everything is still unclear 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.329
 After all, before the motorola with batteries 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.480
 problems have never been possible cause 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.090
 is turbo charging but this is already mine 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.700
 assumption that with regards to verse we 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.320
 a message in a savings bank prepares poems 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.600

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.280
 20 megapixels with ultrapixel technology 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.190
 recall that the area was reported and and 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.299
 other specifications 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.660
 five-inch display and 8 nuclear 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.019
 qualcomm snapdragon processor 810 3 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.630
 2840 gigabyte ram and battery 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.310
 milliamps per hour and still networks appeared and 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.260
 first photos of new items 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.850
 smartphone looks very similar to its 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.280
 predecessor review of which we 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.569
 filmed last year 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.610
 the only noticeable difference is square 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.590
 Camera control in our opinion ah si 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.319

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.120
 2015 especially because of the new

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.040
 0 Iâ€™m only doing three little ones 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.260
 steps 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.780

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.420

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.860
 there is time to redo it is necessary 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.979
 move the off and lock button 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.019
 from the top to the side and finally not 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.489
 to philosophize with the camera and just give you 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.159
 can make good quality 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.250
 pictures we know that sisi is capable of anything 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:29.229
 it and believe that it all will turn out well, 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.310
 qualcomm processors are probably one of 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.010
 most popular manufacturers 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.720
 mobile chip companies corner ready 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.640

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.530
 created by a process of 14 nanometers 820 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.320
 The chip contains 8 64-bit processor cores. 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.780

 characteristics snapdragon 800 15 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.099
 Unlike the 820 is that it though 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.840
 8th shooting gallery but they work on technology 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.539
