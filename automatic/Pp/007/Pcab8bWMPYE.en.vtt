00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
think the first half i'll go like 50 50

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
think the first half i'll go like 50 50
free<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.059> free<00:00:48.450> use<00:00:49.200> only<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.680> co<00:00:49.890> streak

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
free and free use only one co streak

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.450 
free and free use only one co streak
which<00:00:51.059> kills<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> stealth<00:00:52.379> chopper<00:00:52.770> doesn't

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460

have you know moved on so that wasn't
really<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.530> factor<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.369> sold<00:01:29.579> but
