00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.000
 in the eighth finals of the mike for a 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.420
 juniors man psv a1 against home 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.179
 FC Utrecht PSV A1 dog cups 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.799
 last season and the opportunity is for it 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.599
 the team of pascal jansen 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.240
 so you had to send away will by 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.590
 cut for this at vreekamp 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 then I know that ball ready for pole 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.189
 but his name is not good 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.390
 and so the first chance for psv became a1 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.270
 lost that initiative lay with the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.430
 home team in the opening phase mahmoud 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.809
 real ball that luckily in the mess 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 then hold the middle between a shot and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.250
 a cross 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 but it remains 0 0 both teams come 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.149
 in the national premier division for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.370
 a-juniors war psv is the leader and fc 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.210
 utrecht at position 4 is ready 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.559
 utrecht here in the attack because who 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.969
 but gets the free kick to the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.969
 violation of wouter verstraete 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.969
 for tender hooyberghs in the cool at psv 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.969
 a1 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 amrabat approaches the free-kick 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 couple of black and he comes utrecht 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.930
 by good lead 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.110
 free kick from sofyan amrabat and then 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.090
 completely free brian black 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.960
 so d10 originated for utrecht to 19 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 minutes and utrecht continued immediately 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.090
 church with the happiness you forever church 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.469
 he must stand between three players 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 by 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.130
 But the shot is a chorus for Thomas 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.130
 hooyberghs 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.729
 PSV man with the engine back on pole 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.670
 pole then the modulo the becky 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.170
 excellent opportunity for the equalizer but 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.280
 the boat's counter shoots on the legs of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.280
 menno house had a chance for psv a1 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.099
 good back well know piles 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.130
 normally this kind of can 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:09.390
 both en dani van der moot spends the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.400
 cordon of the same post in part 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.150
 Goalkeeper house Google loose and he does 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.920
 also 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.209
 then that ball falls over the goal line and is 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.209
 it's the same one 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 in swinger van know pole and house 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.640
 is not bothered but that ball 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.060
 let go and put both teams on equal 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.060
 height 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:42.389
 the wise duel with the tall and the us 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.880
 moment that duel is just stronger though 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.709
 according to wood, one has been violated 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.489
 so again a free kick for 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.489
 FC Utrecht 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.030
 and it was dangerous last time 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.889
 black for in andy ristie black 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.609
 scores again and again 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.609
 brian black 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.850
 heading back is from bukhari and black 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.140
 simply head it in the far corner and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.140
 he knocked for the second time 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.230
 then to rest again the free kick from 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.900
 amrabat 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.250
 and again black that comes and this time 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.720
 that ball was in front but what was standing 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.720
 he released that brian black again 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.830
 amrabat with and some yarn replay ball 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.330
 and therefore the corner for PSV 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.330
 the headline strong evidence forward 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.770
 rotating ball comes from post and the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.700
 header of the wise and beautifully 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.700
 I am right here again 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.520
 and so the fourth goal this match that 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.320
 arises from the standard situation 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:58.290
 nice couple from the wise to the good 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:04:00.870
 corner of pole by will my videos and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.440
 here again the corner for PSV 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.760
 we have seen how dangerous they are 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.130
 post back behind the ball and that I 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.660
 for the feet of hey what a great 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.230
 rescue from home because this paul was 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.080
 different 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.420
 certainly the bolder now you what in it 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.299
 field for lundquist 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.630
 so close to the lead for psv 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.630
 mahmoud 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.330
 here a little between seedorf and bukhari 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.800
 both off with the ball the cross 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.770
 at the second post comes a must 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.210
 sambo who could have been 3 but 2 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.440
 remains 2 2 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.840
 and because it is a cup competition 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.710
 the arrows are taken by must 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.910
 winner but good with the first 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.140
 for psv levels of or more the angle and 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.350
 had to 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.210
 so you also say he is the fold 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.810
 front house 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.810
 man mess camp 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.560
 is untenable no chance for that 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.560
 hooyberghs and utrecht therefore ahead 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.930
 then mountain wine comes for the equalizer 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:18.930
 neat in the corner and he is ditmar 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.280
 no chance than brian black 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.730
 score already twice in the regular 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.560
 playing now then twice with 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.560
 now head quietly in the corner 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.170
 how sinologous all those remain very calm 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.170
 and PSV again at the same height 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.370
 but more robust still behind the 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.370
 facts 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.910
 bukhari 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.390
 how Belgian alignment is included 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.290
 the right corner also this ball goes in and 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.290
 so utrecht again on the lead 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.270
 had to stay such a high icy calm 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.720
 maybe to judge in the corner outside 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.810
 range of my house so the state again 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.810
 equal 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.110
 stan admiral who Hooyberghs the 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.840
 wrong angle 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:19.039
 and then the goal is in front of the 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.500
 next hit trevor and now we have to 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.910
 score to keep psv in the race and that 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.530
 the fall entrusted to wisdom 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.360
 brings the score to 4 4 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.240
 but so the after turn for FC Utrecht 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.039
 because if dad is melody like the score 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.320
 utrecht 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.720
 and he does not stand a chance now 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.849
 thomas haystack and sunlight 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.210
 title holder out and so cup Utrecht 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.210
 further
