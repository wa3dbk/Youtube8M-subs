00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.800 
that later but this one goes all the way
down<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:09.580> what<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.700> can't<00:02:10.910> go<00:02:11.090> now<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.690> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
down to what it can't go now we have to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:23.280 
down to what it can't go now we have to
do<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:14.480> posts<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.800> one<00:02:20.800> all<00:02:21.800> right

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
do these posts and this one all right

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.570 
do these posts and this one all right
and<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:24.610> let's<00:02:25.610> break<00:02:25.850> down<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.180> legs<00:02:30.580> and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
and now let's break down the legs and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.430 
and now let's break down the legs and
this<00:02:31.700> Dan<00:02:31.910> does<00:02:32.090> take<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> while<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.600> it's<00:02:33.380> a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
this Dan does take a while to it's a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.050 
this Dan does take a while to it's a
breakdown<00:02:34.209> let's<00:02:35.209> go<00:02:35.330> ahead<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.569> tighten<00:02:37.060> and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
breakdown let's go ahead and tighten and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.690 
breakdown let's go ahead and tighten and
then<00:02:38.920> lower<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:42.680> look<00:02:42.890> how<00:02:43.040> small

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
then lower this so now look how small

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.970 
then lower this so now look how small
that<00:02:43.970> stand<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.510> compared<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.170> what<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.440> was<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
that stand is compared to what it was a

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.670 
that stand is compared to what it was a
couple<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.519> minutes<00:02:46.790> ago<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.110> what<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> do<00:02:48.410> now

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
couple of minutes ago so what I do now

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.059 
couple of minutes ago so what I do now
is<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.190> go<00:02:49.340> ahead<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.580> put<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.380> first<00:02:51.680> use

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
is I go ahead and put this in first use

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.430 
is I go ahead and put this in first use
my<00:02:52.220> Callaway<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.569> put<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:54.319> stand<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.890> first<00:02:56.440> so

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
my Callaway I put this stand in first so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.380 
my Callaway I put this stand in first so
the<00:02:57.739> smaller<00:02:58.069> stands<00:02:58.459> will<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.850> able<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.150> sit

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
the smaller stands will be able to sit

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.559 
the smaller stands will be able to sit
on<00:02:59.540> top<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:01.459> now<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.330> that

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
on top of that so now that we have that

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.000 
on top of that so now that we have that
stand<00:03:02.870> packed<00:03:03.140> away<00:03:03.319> let's<00:03:03.620> go<00:03:03.739> ahead<00:03:03.830> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
stand packed away let's go ahead and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.000 
stand packed away let's go ahead and
take<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.190> look<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.489> our<00:03:04.610> next<00:03:04.790> step
