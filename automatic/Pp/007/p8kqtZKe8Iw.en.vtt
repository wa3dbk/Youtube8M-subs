00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
really enjoyed using him now for his

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
really enjoyed using him now for his
negatives<00:01:39.720> he<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.560> weak<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.159> don't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
negatives he is really weak so don't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.950 
negatives he is really weak so don't
expect<00:01:41.549> him<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.119> able<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.570> shove<00:01:42.780> off

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
expect him to be able to shove off

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
expect him to be able to shove off
defenders<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> how<00:01:44.520> fast<00:01:44.939> he<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
defenders but because of how fast he is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.780 
defenders but because of how fast he is
and<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.600> good<00:01:46.590> his<00:01:46.770> boot<00:01:47.040> control<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.549> he

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and how good his boot control is he

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
and how good his boot control is he
might<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.119> able<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> hold<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> ball<00:01:49.350> as

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
might be able to hold on to the ball as

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
might be able to hold on to the ball as
long<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.130> possible<00:01:50.490> before<00:01:51.180> his<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
long as possible before his on the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.139 
long as possible before his on the
ground<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.649> he<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.640> weak<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
ground but he is really really weak and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.030 
ground but he is really really weak and
I<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.450> his<00:01:54.570> aggression<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.619> bad<00:01:55.829> as

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
I think his aggression is really bad as

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.719 
I think his aggression is really bad as
well<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.020> strength<00:01:58.020> wise<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.280> he<00:01:59.549> also

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
well so strength wise he is he also

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609 
well so strength wise he is he also
