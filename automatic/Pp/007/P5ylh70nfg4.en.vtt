transition<00:00:49.520> between<00:00:50.230> preparation<00:00:51.430> backswing

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
racket and the racket never stops moving

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.960 
racket and the racket never stops moving
all<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.010> way<00:01:04.130> through<00:01:04.340> contact<00:01:04.850> and

all the way through contact and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.510 
all the way through contact and
follow-through

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.830 

okay<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.579> reinforce<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> concept<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.960> want

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
okay to reinforce this concept I want

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.619 
okay to reinforce this concept I want
watch<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.170> two<00:01:14.289> more<00:01:14.439> times
