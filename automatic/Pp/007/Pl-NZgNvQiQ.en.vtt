demonstrate how to put the fiscal fuse
in<00:00:51.500> okay<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.890> we're<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
in okay what we're going to do first is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.310 
in okay what we're going to do first is
you're<00:00:54.179> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.359> notice<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.019> is<00:00:55.199> how

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you're going to notice this is how

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
you're going to notice this is how
exactly<00:00:55.859> it's<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.339> come<00:00:56.719> would<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
exactly it's going to come would you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.939 
exactly it's going to come would you
know<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> remove<00:00:58.499> this<00:00:58.710> you're

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
know is going to remove this you're

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.349 
know is going to remove this you're
going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> untwine<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.760> you're<00:01:00.179> going<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
going to untwine this you're going to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.529 
going to untwine this you're going to
break<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.780> clips<00:01:01.109> apart<00:01:02.179> so<00:01:03.179> that<00:01:03.210> there's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
break these clips apart so that there's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.930 
break these clips apart so that there's
going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.749> be<00:01:03.809> six<00:01:04.470> individuals<00:01:07.760> okay<00:01:08.760> went

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
going to be six individuals okay went

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.510 
going to be six individuals okay went
ahead<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.330> broke<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.190> individuals<00:01:11.190> off

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
ahead and I broke the individuals off

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.040 
ahead and I broke the individuals off
the<00:01:11.940> clip<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.480> can<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:13.010> these<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.900> go

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
the clip so you can have these to go

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.410 
the clip so you can have these to go
where<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.260> need<00:01:16.410> them<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.620> go<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:18.120> next<00:01:18.150> step

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
where you need them to go the next step

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.160 
where you need them to go the next step
will<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.680> ahead<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.570> break<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.720> thin

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
will be to go ahead and break these thin

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
will be to go ahead and break these thin
wires<00:01:22.410> down<00:01:22.790> there's<00:01:24.080> six<00:01:25.100> igniters<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
wires down there's six igniters so that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.840 
wires down there's six igniters so that
means<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.090> 12<00:01:28.370> individual<00:01:29.370> wires<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
means there are 12 individual wires that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.840 
means there are 12 individual wires that
you<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.480> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.500> break<00:01:31.710> apart<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.340> then

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you have to kind of break apart and then

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.800 
you have to kind of break apart and then
we're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> wire<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.390> all<00:01:33.660> in<00:01:33.810> parallel

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
we're going to wire it all in parallel

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.380 
we're going to wire it all in parallel
okay<00:01:36.810> went<00:01:37.110> ahead<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.820> we<00:01:38.820> hooked<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.180> all

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
okay went ahead and we hooked up all

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.990 
okay went ahead and we hooked up all
those<00:01:39.570> wires<00:01:39.900> into<00:01:40.610> parallel<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
those wires into parallel so it's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.970 
those wires into parallel so it's
basically<00:01:42.480> connected<00:01:43.200> polarity<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.830> not

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
basically connected polarity is not

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.200 
basically connected polarity is not
important<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.120> we're

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
important on this because all we're

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
important on this because all we're
gonna<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.420> we're<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.750> send<00:01:45.870> bolts

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
gonna do is we're going to send bolts

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.850 
gonna do is we're going to send bolts
through<00:01:47.070> each<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:48.050> or<00:01:49.050> should<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.440> go<00:01:49.470> through

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
through each one or should I go through

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.380 
through each one or should I go through
the<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:51.030> cable<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.630> each<00:01:52.620> individual

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
the the cable into each individual

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.860 
the the cable into each individual
igniter<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.660> same<00:01:54.840> time<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.780> there's<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
igniter at the same time and there's a

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.210 
igniter at the same time and there's a
nichrome<00:01:58.290> wire<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:58.980> it's<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
nichrome wire in there and it's the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.740 
nichrome wire in there and it's the
voltage<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.850> nichrome<00:02:00.150> wire<00:02:00.150> it's<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.690> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
voltage the nichrome wire it's going to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
voltage the nichrome wire it's going to
heat<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.430> it's<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.670> ignite<00:02:02.940> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
heat up and it's going to ignite the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.770 
heat up and it's going to ignite the
visco

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.040 

does<00:02:06.409> visco<00:02:06.890> all<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.280> do<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.630> open<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:08.990> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
goes once you get it in and it looks

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.320 
goes once you get it in and it looks
like<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.459> see<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.880> go<00:02:23.030> ahead<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.180> you

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
like and see it you go ahead and you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.410 
like and see it you go ahead and you
push<00:02:23.600> down<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.760> make<00:02:25.910> sure<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.300> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
push down on this to make sure that the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.600 
push down on this to make sure that the
visco<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.050> pushed<00:02:27.620> into<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.040> channel<00:02:28.430> nice

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
visco is pushed into that channel nice

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.110 
visco is pushed into that channel nice
and<00:02:29.120> tight<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.610> then<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.790> look<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120

the system on to test the blue light
came<00:03:37.310> on<00:03:37.340> here<00:03:37.820> indicating<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.510> we<00:03:38.690> have

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
came on here indicating that we have

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.229 
came on here indicating that we have

continually now we are in parallel which

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.750 
continually now we are in parallel which
means<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.600> can't<00:03:41.930> individually<00:03:42.650> test<00:03:42.980> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
means you can't individually test the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.380 
means you can't individually test the
continually<00:03:44.420> on<00:03:44.510> each<00:03:44.780> queue<00:03:45.200> but<00:03:46.030> at<00:03:47.030> least<00:03:47.180> I

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
continually on each queue but at least I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.840 
continually on each queue but at least I

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
know one of the six is good and the only

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.120 
know one of the six is good and the only
way<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.120> test<00:03:50.450> individually<00:03:51.170> would<00:03:51.769> be<00:03:51.920> to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
way to test individually would be to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.509 
way to test individually would be to
hook<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:52.489> into<00:03:52.549> series<00:03:53.859> which<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.220> problem

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
hook this into series which the problem

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.120 
hook this into series which the problem
with<00:03:55.609> series<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.239> as<00:03:57.109> soon<00:03:57.350> as<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.590> first<00:03:57.769> wire
