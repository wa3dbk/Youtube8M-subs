00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.040 
yeah that's great but the thing is you
mix<00:02:09.750> yellows<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:11.009> are<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.129> gonna<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
mix yellows what are you gonna get a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.040 
mix yellows what are you gonna get a
so<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.740> kind<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.130> like<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.670> was<00:02:14.300> really<00:02:14.750> bummed

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
so it's kind of like I was really bummed

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.600 
so it's kind of like I was really bummed
out<00:02:15.290> because<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.710> hoping<00:02:16.070> I'd<00:02:16.250> get<00:02:16.370> some

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
out because I was hoping I'd get some

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.260 
out because I was hoping I'd get some
like<00:02:16.730> really

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
like really

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.250 
like really
grody<00:02:18.200> nasty<00:02:19.040> colors<00:02:19.460> like<00:02:20.240> some<00:02:20.450> weird<00:02:20.930> ones

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.960 
grody nasty colors like some weird ones
that<00:02:21.500> would<00:02:21.590> clash<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.430> could<00:02:22.610> make<00:02:22.760> new

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that would clash so I could make new

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.260 
that would clash so I could make new
colors<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.800> know<00:02:24.950> try<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.550> struggle

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
itself

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.980 
itself
I<00:02:49.010> used<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.550> sepia<00:02:50.090> colored<00:02:51.760> micron<00:02:52.760> pen<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.930> it

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
I used a sepia colored micron pen so it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.560 
I used a sepia colored micron pen so it
looks<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.350> Sakura<00:02:54.800> micron<00:02:55.340> pens<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.030> I

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
looks like the Sakura micron pens and I

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.490 
looks like the Sakura micron pens and I
used<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.080> one<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.920> brush<00:02:58.330> brush<00:02:59.330> tip<00:02:59.750> or

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
used the one with the brush brush tip or

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.860 
used the one with the brush brush tip or
something<00:03:00.680> at<00:03:01.610> least<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.880> think<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.360> was<00:03:02.390> sepia

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
something at least I think it was sepia

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.560 
something at least I think it was sepia
yeah<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.320> was<00:03:03.530> yeah<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.250> was<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.850> was<00:03:05.150> I'm<00:03:05.450> gonna

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
yeah it was yeah it was it was I'm gonna

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.800 
yeah it was yeah it was it was I'm gonna
use<00:03:05.750> black<00:03:06.020> for<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.350> second<00:03:06.590> one<00:03:06.710> so<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:08.000> had<00:03:08.450> it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
use black for the second one so I had it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.220 
use black for the second one so I had it
was<00:03:09.800> interesting<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.550> don't<00:03:11.540> want<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.840> say<00:03:12.020> head

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
was interesting I don't want to say head

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.870 
was interesting I don't want to say head
difficulty<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.310> don't<00:03:13.490> think<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.820> can

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
difficulty but I just don't think I can

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.600 
difficulty but I just don't think I can
use<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.420> brush<00:03:14.690> tip<00:03:14.990> pen<00:03:15.380> very<00:03:15.740> well<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.340> think

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
use the brush tip pen very well I think

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.920 
use the brush tip pen very well I think
that's<00:03:16.910> something<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.450> have<00:03:17.720> to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that's something that you have to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.850 
that's something that you have to
practice<00:03:18.170> with<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:19.670> your<00:03:19.970> your<00:03:20.660> brush<00:03:21.260> tip

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
practice with and if your your brush tip

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.400 
practice with and if your your brush tip
at<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.280> damaged<00:03:22.910> at<00:03:23.150> all<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.720> will<00:03:24.140> really

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
at is damaged at all it will really

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.620 
at is damaged at all it will really
contribute<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.370> your<00:03:26.150> art<00:03:26.360> looking<00:03:26.690> bad<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
contribute to your art looking bad so to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470 
contribute to your art looking bad so to
make<00:03:29.810> up<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.560> lack<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.010> colors<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.209> had

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
make up for the lack of colors I had

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.150 
make up for the lack of colors I had
because<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.840> just<00:03:33.020> had<00:03:33.230> yellow<00:03:33.530> basically

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
because I just had yellow basically

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.820 
because I just had yellow basically
different<00:03:34.580> kinds<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.120> yellow<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.630> made<00:03:36.500> sure

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
different kinds of yellow I made sure

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.820 
different kinds of yellow I made sure
that<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.580> did<00:03:38.240> a<00:03:38.480> lot<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:40.780> kind<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.900> like<00:03:42.110> shading

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
that I did a lot of kind of like shading

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.910 
that I did a lot of kind of like shading
with<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.100> line<00:03:43.310> work<00:03:43.520> itself<00:03:44.050> so<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.080> could<00:03:45.350> try

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
with the line work itself so I could try

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.610 
with the line work itself so I could try
to<00:03:45.980> give<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.370> more<00:03:46.640> dimension<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
to give it more dimension and the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.740 
to give it more dimension and the
problem<00:03:49.100> with<00:03:49.250> having<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.730> skin<00:03:50.000> color<00:03:50.270> is<00:03:50.540> that

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
problem with having a skin color is that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.140 
problem with having a skin color is that
you<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:51.140> only<00:03:51.380> use<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.890> skin<00:03:52.160> color<00:03:52.430> to

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
you can only use the skin color to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.480 
you can only use the skin color to
basically<00:03:53.690> be<00:03:53.990> a<00:03:54.020> skin<00:03:54.320> color<00:03:54.590> because<00:03:54.830> if<00:03:55.280> you

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
basically be a skin color because if you

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.400 
basically be a skin color because if you
use<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.850> color<00:03:56.060> anywhere<00:03:56.510> else<00:03:56.690> it's<00:03:57.140> gonna

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
use that color anywhere else it's gonna

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.230 
use that color anywhere else it's gonna
look<00:03:57.680> like<00:03:57.740> skin<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.580> you're<00:03:58.790> like<00:03:58.970> it'll

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
look like skin and you're like it'll

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.220 
look like skin and you're like it'll
grow<00:03:59.600> is<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.170> hell<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.709> skin<00:04:01.250> colored<00:04:01.610> flower

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
grow is the hell a skin colored flower

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.360 
grow is the hell a skin colored flower
nobody<00:04:03.230> wants<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.590> see<00:04:03.800> that

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370
