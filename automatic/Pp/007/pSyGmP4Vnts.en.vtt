00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 today I bring you a video of a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.480
 functional application but very fast it 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.750
 call time to phone and it is this that you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.530
 in here 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.190
 this application what is going to do is that 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.800
 will allow you to use your keyboard 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:28.699
 mac or your mac to type say in 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.320
 your iphone on your on your ipad ipad mini or 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.590
 in others this in other devices 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.280
 seen many people who use the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.280
 they buy a new 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.360
 buy a keyboard as wireless with 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.890
 bluetooth to be able to write on the ipad 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.870
 but in truth it is not necessary only 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.030
 if you buy this application type to 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.050
 phone that is like 199 two dollars more 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.180
 or less in the app store of the mac you can 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.490
 do that so the only thing you have 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.980
 what to do to connect as you see here 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.940
 it says disconnected did you see it l my 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.790
 phone to win 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.760
 to not have to do on the phone 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.070
 so that it's what I have on hand so 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.940
 that we are going to turn on the bluetooth 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.940
 Lets put 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.080
 and that you are seeing it 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.290
 screen so they can see it so 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.160
 let's put and let's make sure 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.860
 that youtube in our friend is there 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.560
 but you have to secure a team of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.550
 our computer is so that it is 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.320
 activates obviously and is in mode 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.260
 available so you can see it so 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.160
 it's there I'm going to give you a 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.160
 I will not connect 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.860
 and so we 're going to connect ok and we're going to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.810
 look like these allow a number of 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.810
 confirmation and iphone 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.350
 on the computer that wants to connect you 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.569
 verify that the number is good and is 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.090
 that and now we are already connected and how 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.440
 come here in the application, the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.230
 iphone iphone 5 then to already be 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.230
 connected we are going to open an application 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.290
 where we have to write something we're going to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.410
 give more to create a note and as you see 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.030
 I do not see the keyboard to write 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.920
 with my phone but no no 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.959
 just be that now and we're going to 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.690
 use this application to write 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.010
 in this in this note 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.010
 let's continue writing my name 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.550
 and how can you see while I'm going 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.310
 writing in this application are going to 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.250
 leave all the characters that I have what 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.320
 that I'm putting on my keyboard the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.110
 computer will be appearing my 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.180

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.180
 let's put my name my last name 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.180
 and there they give it to enter also going to give 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.400
 enter what they want all that numbers 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.959
 they can erase too and it's simply 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.440
 an option much easier than 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.900
 buy us a keyboard for 30 to 40 dollars 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.849
 that you will not always use it and if you have 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.489
 a keyboard and if you have a computer 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.410
 with bluetooth functionality there is no 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.989
 need that you have to buy a 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.090
 keyboard do not spend your money please be 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.310

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.129
 like two dollars in the southern app that you're going to 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.989

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.959
 if sometimes they want to write on their ipad 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.300
