insulator everything below this line is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.740 
insulator everything below this line is
insulated<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> top<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:17.480> still

nylon I'm just putting the breathable
nylon<00:02:20.030> cover<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.430> all<00:02:22.549> very<00:02:22.580> very

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
nylon cover so it's all very very

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.410 
nylon cover so it's all very very
lightweight<00:02:24.250> what<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> did<00:02:25.549> different<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.180> this

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
lightweight what I did different on this

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.920 
lightweight what I did different on this
one<00:02:29.140> was<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.290> used<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:32.170> felt<00:02:33.170> seen

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
one was I used a it's felt seen

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:44.979 
one was I used a it's felt seen
everywhere<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.430> only<00:02:43.670> finding<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.750> right

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
everywhere the only finding is right

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.810 
everywhere the only finding is right
here<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.440> edge<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.840> over

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
here on this edge that you go in over

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.430 
here on this edge that you go in over
there's<00:02:49.820> no<00:02:50.060> binding<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.750> seat<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.290> it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
there's no binding on the seat so it's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.020 
there's no binding on the seat so it's
sort<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.830> gossamer<00:02:52.310> light

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.790 

so<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:58.140> there's<00:02:58.800> two<00:02:59.010> rows<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.250> stitching

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
so you see there's two rows of stitching

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.370 
so you see there's two rows of stitching
everywhere<00:03:01.800> on<00:03:02.010> every<00:03:02.310> seam<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.940> outside

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
everywhere on every seam on the outside

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.950 
everywhere on every seam on the outside
and<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.710> inside<00:03:05.390> because<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.600> felled

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
and on the inside because of that felled

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:19.580 
and on the inside because of that felled
seam<00:03:07.350> let's<00:03:08.040> look<00:03:08.190> underneath<00:03:08.670> again

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.520 

itself<00:03:20.220> seem<00:03:20.640> there's<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> darts<00:03:21.810> on

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
itself seem there's one of the darts on

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:37.650 
itself seem there's one of the darts on
the<00:03:22.650> bottom<00:03:24.379> look<00:03:26.840> damn<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.170> stern

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.480
