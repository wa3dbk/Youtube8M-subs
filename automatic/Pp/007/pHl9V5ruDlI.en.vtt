camera<00:04:04.540> now<00:04:05.019> it's<00:04:05.259> on<00:04:05.439> the<00:04:05.709> screen<00:04:05.949> itself

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099

which<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.400> actually<00:04:06.669> very<00:04:06.819> hand<00:04:07.180> because<00:04:07.419> your

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
which is actually very hand because your

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.789 
which is actually very hand because your
finger<00:04:08.109> doesn't<00:04:08.259> really<00:04:08.439> have<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.709> go

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
finger doesn't really have to go

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.499 
finger doesn't really have to go
anywhere<00:04:09.129> so<00:04:09.280> I'm<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.489> going<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.699> for<00:04:10.449> the

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
anywhere so I'm just going to for the

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.240 
anywhere so I'm just going to for the
sake<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.959> demo<00:04:11.199> use<00:04:11.439> this<00:04:11.650> finger<00:04:12.069> I

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
sake of this demo use this finger I

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.849 
sake of this demo use this finger I
probably<00:04:12.759> would<00:04:13.000> use<00:04:13.150> my<00:04:13.299> thumb<00:04:13.659> but<00:04:14.590> anyway

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
probably would use my thumb but anyway

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.229 
probably would use my thumb but anyway
use<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.370> finger<00:04:15.669> and<00:04:15.759> as<00:04:15.819> you<00:04:15.909> can<00:04:16.030> see<00:04:16.060> if

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
use this finger and as you can see if

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.020 
use this finger and as you can see if
you<00:04:16.329> hold<00:04:16.570> down<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.310> camera<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.880> can

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
you hold down on the camera you can

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.719 
you hold down on the camera you can
actually<00:04:19.269> access<00:04:19.690> some<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.769> camera

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
actually access some of the camera

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.140 
actually access some of the camera
settings<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.210> if<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.360> scrub<00:04:22.750> upward<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:24.280> turn

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
settings so if I scrub upward I can turn

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.589 
settings so if I scrub upward I can turn
on<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.389> flash<00:04:25.630> or<00:04:26.440> turn<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.680> off<00:04:27.210> over<00:04:28.210> here<00:04:28.539> I

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
on the flash or turn it off over here I

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.719 
on the flash or turn it off over here I
can<00:04:28.870> change<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.440> auto<00:04:29.590> white<00:04:29.830> balance<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.580> can

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
can change the auto white balance it can

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.670 
can change the auto white balance it can
be<00:04:30.849> on<00:04:30.969> to<00:04:31.599> cloudy

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
be on to cloudy

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.270 
be on to cloudy
or<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.250> tungsten<00:04:33.460> or<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.940> sunny<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.419> then

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
or the tungsten or to sunny and then

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.770 
or the tungsten or to sunny and then
exposure<00:04:36.280> compensation<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:37.120> over<00:04:37.479> here<00:04:37.630> we

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
exposure compensation is over here we

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.689 
exposure compensation is over here we
scrub<00:04:38.050> downward<00:04:38.440> from<00:04:38.919> plus<00:04:39.220> 2<00:04:39.430> all<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.580> way

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
scrub downward from plus 2 all the way

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.999 
scrub downward from plus 2 all the way
to<00:04:39.820> negative<00:04:40.210> 2<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.570> all<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.590> have<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> do<00:04:41.919> is

also use it use that to turn the camera

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.760 
also use it use that to turn the camera
around<00:04:47.580> there<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.669> go<00:04:49.169> so<00:04:50.169> that's<00:04:50.350> that's<00:04:50.590> an
