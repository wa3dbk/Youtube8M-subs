00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the theory not every suicide squad 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.089
 juras word two and eight catalanes orders 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.089
 welcome to jl vision 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.630
 it seems that an internet has emerged 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.940
 crazy theory about the squad joker 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.440
 suicidal that what they say is not that no 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.349
 look like I want you directly 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.170
 it is not the joker nor more nor less than it would be 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.790
 an old robin him the joker 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.410
 got to take to the dark side and 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.300
 turn him into the new me that in the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.790
 shock would be dead and this would be the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.010
 legacy left by the joker to do the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.300
 damn to batman this is because in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.100
 a batman animation movie 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.710
 we could see what exactly happened 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.930
 with one of the robbins and therefore has 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.260
 this theory arose to me I would love 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.610
 I would go crazy that the joker was that 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.870
 an old robben that has become the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.549
 joker and that the real me that 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.010
 simply be dead or 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.110
 disappeared that I would love to 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.970
 passion would do and then it would make sense 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.680
 to this weird aspect that has the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.110
 joker but he has a personality 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.150
 so similar to his I would love and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.600
 I would make sense of my universe of dc 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.430
 but surely it is to that truth because 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.229
 it's a theory it's not even a rumor 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.299
 surely I think he was doing 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 for squad society be the joker and if 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.880
 so as I still find it 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.730
 of perfect personality but appearance 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 eat 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.260
 there seems to be the possibility that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.050
 there is a sequel to the mythical movie 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.300
 of space jam apparently it would be 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.950
 starring lebron james in the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.780
 At that time, nothing else would be known about her 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 because they have only registered the name of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 the movie in a sequel would have to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 leave Michael Jordan since it does not explode 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.120
 from the first to second class about 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 Basque last names are already hungry and 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.380
 Catalan last names where you bring your most 8 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 Catalan surnames by title and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.840
 let's see what he's going to play now 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.550
 what stagnate jones first poster 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.920
 of my children's pilgrim home 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.230
 peculiar directed by me more or less 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.720
 that tim burton that lately they do not 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.500
 very good movies but the poster 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.290
 it looks good 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.200
 chloÃ« grace moretz adds to the cast of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.940
 damn neighbors 2 so we have a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.190
 quite interesting addition to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.830
 This movie asked me who I was 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.350
 here will be one of those bad ones of 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.210
 that new fraternity that will move and be 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.910
 will put neighbors with the protagonists 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.890
 of 1 or maybe it has something to do with 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.940
 zac efron will be the girlfriend of kc from 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.520
 maybe 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.850
 the unnecessary second part is in 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.850
 path 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.100
 is the third highest grossing film 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.810
 of the world a post that lately every 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.440
 two months since he does not have a movie 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.090
 different is a position that changes almost 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.650
 almost every day is no longer a position that 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.150
 last a long time soon another movie will arrive 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.830
 which will also be the third most 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.900
 blockbuster around the world and swear 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.660
 seaworld will not lose but right now what 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.210
 has that position and because of that we can 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.840
 already have something sure there will be part two 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.710
 in fact there is already date June 22, 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.510
 2018 in three years and now it's coming 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.850
 the doubts in the second part I just came back 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.430
 to Malcolm and in the third he returned to it 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.470
 what does this mean for the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 new movie of juras world will not return 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.440
 to nobody go back to any 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.990
 that is the big doubt and also not 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.540
 already answer chris pratt and bryce dallas 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.000
 howard are already confirmed for this 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.530
 sequel so we can already have that 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.780
 sure they will return the same from the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.060
 previous movie but the question is 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.480
 what the hell will a sequel from July to 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.610
 SeaWorld is , if jurassic park and vows 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.140
 Seaworld are the same story that 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.340
 we can expect from this movie if the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.660
 movie goes about a couple 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.250
 in the park there is a dinosaur of 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.050
 user runs away and eats all the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.310
 world if we have already seen that they are going to 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.970
 do now I do not think they're going to do 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.840
 another park again is that would already be very 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.400
 so knowing already that there's going to be 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.379
 sequel and leaving since they are going to repeat 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.300
 actors of the first the only thing that I 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.730
 it remains to know is that anger 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.230
