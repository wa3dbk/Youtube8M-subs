00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 s 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.340
 what a pink wave as they are I'm cousin their 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.509
 lemon I hope it is very good in this 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.970
 I come to bring you a little 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.920
 Gestha tutorial 5 online mode how 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.210
 put a helicopter to you will see but 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.619
 Well first of all you know how to give it a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.180
 brush that you what is this video 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 remember that this helps me and drives me 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.539
 very much like subscribing to what 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 which are social networks and the channel for 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 more videos like these now gentlemen that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.879
 what we have to do good first 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.070
 that nothing occupies this base in a 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.210
 public game or just by invitation and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.370
 good since we are there 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780
 we occupy what is a helicopter them 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 I recommend that you mark what is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 stuck and ask for a bus art now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.330
 that we have it, we are going to come to what it is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 this little place to enter this 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.110
 small hole that you just marked is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.180
 this one that is exactly there and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.339
 there is a small book for 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 get us to what is that building and 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.159
 then go down the map 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.409
 now let's go up to what is the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.869
 helicopter and let's fly towards that 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.150
 small hollow ok let's try it on 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.949
 do as slow as possible so that 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.659
 obviously, it is not there in what it is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.000
 your helicopter and notice that it returns to 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.880
 repeat what the process is now let's 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.110
 to try to raise only a little and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 since we introduce what is the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.140
 helicopter in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 this little race then to say it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
 so let's try to accommodate it from this 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159
 way more or less and well let's 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 try to raise it very slowly in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.750
 this case hit me what is the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.729
 rear propeller in it as in the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.320
 wall so to speak and I jumped a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 little what the helicopter but good and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.880
 here he entered it I introduced it and we are going to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.549
 try to lower the helicopter now by 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.439
 this little gap not between the four 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.600
 pillars that are there now now 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.430
 I am below the map of the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.530
 saints now I have to go to what is 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.539
 this little point that is not found 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 what are all the accumulated garages and 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.509
 Well obviously I'm going to advance a 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.369
 little what is the camera so that we 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.869
 do then it is slow and good to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.259
 let's get to what this little point is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.149
 let's try to fly below what 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.819
 that is that little point that we mark and 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.530
 good to be obviously rising and 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.179
 elevating elevating us until the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 helicopter manages to get into what is 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.009
 our garage as you can see here 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.630
 appeared but unfortunately my 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.370
 helicopter was very stuck that the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.860
 wall and obviously what the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.600
 they do the propellers then to say it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.010
 so the helicopter does not work anymore 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.610
 then I can not upload to what 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.800
 is 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.360
 helicopter obviously how bad it is 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.560
 this trick is that you can not do it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 you can take out what you were 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.250
 it's just like to do a trick 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.220
 or go fighting what your friends are 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.160
 now if this helicopter for some 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.080
 reason that you do not get to destroy or 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.610
 whether the rest is complete 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.890
 people who are in what they are 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.720
 the public games are going to achieve look 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.220
 what is this helicopter so 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.080
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.940
 what is this little trick so 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.650
 you know it was a fucking like what it is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.600
 this video we're going to see let's follow the 300 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.280
 remember to avoid that they are social networks and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.060
 you know the blue cousin see you in the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.060
 next cool
