00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I'll say give or take 10 minutes it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
I'll say give or take 10 minutes it
didn't<00:00:23.700> take<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.850> long<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.480> defuse<00:00:24.869> my<00:00:25.050> hair

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
didn't take that long to defuse my hair

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.439 
didn't take that long to defuse my hair
so<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.930> anyway<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.890> far<00:00:29.430> as<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so that's good anyway as far as the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.930 
so that's good anyway as far as the
brown<00:00:30.900> pieces<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.860> my<00:00:31.890> hair<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.789> can

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
brown pieces in my hair I think you can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.979 
brown pieces in my hair I think you can
see<00:00:33.149> something<00:00:33.510> right<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:34.609> like<00:00:35.609> it<00:00:35.640> like

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
see something right there i like it like

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.979 
see something right there i like it like
one<00:00:36.989> thing<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.649> curly<00:00:38.520> hair<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.750> good

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
one thing about curly hair the good

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.530 
one thing about curly hair the good
thing<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.230> big<00:00:40.710> curly<00:00:41.160> hair<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.730> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
thing about big curly hair is that you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.340 
thing about big curly hair is that you
can<00:00:42.720> hide<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.050> skates<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.360> blends<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.960> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
can hide the skates it just blends it so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
can hide the skates it just blends it so
having<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.130> your<00:00:47.309> natural<00:00:47.550> hair<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
having like your natural hair just

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.350 
having like your natural hair just
really<00:00:48.930> blends<00:00:49.440> everything<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.210> was

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
really blends everything it so if I was

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.670 
really blends everything it so if I was
wearing<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.719> straight<00:00:51.989> it'll<00:00:52.170> probably<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wearing it straight it'll probably be a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
wearing it straight it'll probably be a
different<00:00:53.160> story<00:00:54.079> probably<00:00:55.079> wouldn't<00:00:55.320> look

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
different story probably wouldn't look

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680 
different story probably wouldn't look
right<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.040> with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> curls<00:00:56.790> definitely

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
right but with the curls definitely

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
right but with the curls definitely
blends<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.710> brown<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.770> but

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
blends it the brown so I like it but

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.899 
blends it the brown so I like it but

definitely what it had and i love the
slip<00:02:05.490> effect<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:08.280> definitely<00:02:08.939> passed<00:02:09.420> that
