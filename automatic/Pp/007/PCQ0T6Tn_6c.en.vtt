00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and that gets them involved in the idea

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
and that gets them involved in the idea
of<00:01:12.270> using<00:01:12.840> their<00:01:13.140> senses<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.530> looking<00:01:13.920> around

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
closely and then when we get up into the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
closely and then when we get up into the
archaeological<00:01:17.159> site<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.450> hope<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.810> be

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
archaeological site then we hope to be
