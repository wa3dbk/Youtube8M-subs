this<00:01:09.420> game's<00:01:09.689> hard<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.619> though<00:01:10.740> it's

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this game's hard I like it though it's

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
this game's hard I like it though it's
really<00:01:11.070> cool<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.240> sort

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
really cool all right we got this sort

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
really cool all right we got this sort
of<00:01:12.659> maybe<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> few<00:01:14.010> shields<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
of maybe so we have a few shields I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.980 
of maybe so we have a few shields I
think<00:01:14.850> that's<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.180> goes<00:01:15.360> away<00:01:15.600> when<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> get

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
think that's what goes away when you get

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.520 
think that's what goes away when you get
hit

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
hit

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.490 
hit
I<00:01:16.560> gotcha<00:01:17.400> makes<00:01:17.820> sense<00:01:18.119> sort<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.290> were<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
I gotcha makes sense sort of if I were a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
I gotcha makes sense sort of if I were a
