extended and then the 99 way up there

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160

a<00:02:13.500> nice<00:02:13.890> wide<00:02:14.190> base<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> 99<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:15.900> just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
a nice wide base on the 99 and then just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500

a standard speaker mount for the 90s
very<00:02:18.900> strong<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.710> think<00:02:19.800> they<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.160> about<00:02:20.340> 150

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
very strong I think they have about 150

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.150 
very strong I think they have about 150
pound<00:02:21.240> weight<00:02:21.720> capacity<00:02:21.840> which<00:02:22.830> keeps<00:02:23.040> them

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
pound weight capacity which keeps them

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.700 
pound weight capacity which keeps them
nice<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.460> sturdy<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.350> worry

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
nice and sturdy not that I have to worry

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.260 
nice and sturdy not that I have to worry
about<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.370> way<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.640> speaker<00:02:26.880> or<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
about the the way the speaker or the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.090 
about the the way the speaker or the
movie<00:02:27.540> had<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.740> gives<00:02:29.010> a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
movie had going on there but it gives a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.970 
movie had going on there but it gives a
nice<00:02:29.390> stability<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.260> buy<00:02:31.440> those<00:02:31.650> cheap
