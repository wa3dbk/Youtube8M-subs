00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
flow okay so they introduced this astral

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
flow okay so they introduced this astral
flow<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.159> we

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
flow which we have kind of know about we

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
flow which we have kind of know about we
know<00:02:02.430> neuron<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> marked<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> while<00:02:03.299> now

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
know neuron is marked for a while now

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.240 
know neuron is marked for a while now
but<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.990> find<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.350> suppose<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
but we find out suppose it out of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.459 
but we find out suppose it out of
nowhere<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:06.689> detect<00:02:07.170> his

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
nowhere that he can actually detect his

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
nowhere that he can actually detect his
par<00:02:07.740> wherever<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.030> these<00:02:09.209> weird

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
par wherever it is like these weird

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
par wherever it is like these weird
green<00:02:09.690> butterflies<00:02:10.140> pop<00:02:10.379> out<00:02:10.530> he<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.739> find<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
green butterflies pop out he can find it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.619 
green butterflies pop out he can find it
but<00:02:11.280> what's<00:02:11.459> funny<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
but what's funny about this is that it

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.320 
but what's funny about this is that it
gets<00:02:12.780> introduced

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
gets introduced

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.000
