00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.389 

I've<00:00:04.810> had<00:00:05.049> a<00:00:05.080> question<00:00:05.259> about<00:00:05.560> how<00:00:05.740> you<00:00:05.950> do<00:00:06.220> the

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:06.399 
I've had a question about how you do the

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.280 
I've had a question about how you do the
3d<00:00:06.670> flips<00:00:07.180> and<00:00:07.330> rolls<00:00:07.390> with<00:00:07.720> the<00:00:07.930> hella<00:00:08.080> guy

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
3d flips and rolls with the hella guy

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.320 
3d flips and rolls with the hella guy
Viper<00:00:08.559> so<00:00:09.309> I<00:00:09.370> thought<00:00:09.610> I've<00:00:09.790> put<00:00:09.969> together<00:00:10.120> a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
Viper so I thought I've put together a

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.270 
Viper so I thought I've put together a
very<00:00:10.570> quick<00:00:10.990> little<00:00:11.139> video<00:00:11.530> to<00:00:11.650> show<00:00:11.860> what<00:00:12.190> you

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
very quick little video to show what you

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.980 
very quick little video to show what you
do<00:00:12.429> on<00:00:12.519> the<00:00:12.610> transmitter<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.360> make<00:00:13.809> that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
do on the transmitter to make that

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.890 
do on the transmitter to make that
happen<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.849> is<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.150> transmitter<00:00:16.599> as<00:00:16.750> its

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
happen this is the transmitter as its

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.929 
happen this is the transmitter as its
turned<00:00:17.140> on<00:00:17.349> and<00:00:17.590> on<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.040> display<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.910> can

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
turned on and on the display you can

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.609 
turned on and on the display you can
actually<00:00:19.330> see<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.720> position<00:00:20.140> of<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.350> trims

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
actually see the position of the trims

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.800 
actually see the position of the trims
you<00:00:21.189> can<00:00:21.369> see<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:21.760> throttle<00:00:22.119> position<00:00:22.240> so<00:00:22.720> if

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
you can see the throttle position so if

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.990 
you can see the throttle position so if
I<00:00:22.900> move<00:00:23.109> that<00:00:23.230> up<00:00:23.380> very<00:00:23.410> slightly<00:00:23.920> you'll<00:00:24.789> see

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
I move that up very slightly you'll see

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.910 
I move that up very slightly you'll see
the<00:00:25.090> numbers<00:00:25.390> change<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:26.019> you<00:00:26.529> can<00:00:26.680> see<00:00:26.800> the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
the numbers change and you can see the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.920 
the numbers change and you can see the
battery<00:00:27.130> condition<00:00:27.460> in<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.119> top<00:00:28.359> left<00:00:28.720> hand

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
battery condition in the top left hand

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.650 
battery condition in the top left hand
side<00:00:29.140> you<00:00:30.010> can<00:00:30.160> also<00:00:30.310> see<00:00:30.670> that<00:00:30.849> this<00:00:31.029> LED

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
side you can also see that this LED

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.270 
side you can also see that this LED
being<00:00:31.960> lit<00:00:32.169> I'll<00:00:32.410> cover<00:00:32.590> X<00:00:32.800> it<00:00:32.980> helps<00:00:33.190> the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
being lit I'll cover X it helps the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.750 
being lit I'll cover X it helps the
camera<00:00:33.610> focus<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.180> on<00:00:34.840> solid<00:00:35.530> now<00:00:36.309> if<00:00:36.549> you

at the bottom in the middle it'll click
on<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.909> expert<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.930> light<00:00:50.110> will<00:00:50.320> flash<00:00:51.269> so

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
on to expert and the light will flash so

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.820 
on to expert and the light will flash so
hopefully<00:00:52.659> now<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:52.900> can<00:00:53.170> see<00:00:53.379> just<00:00:53.589> above

hopefully now you can see just above

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.160 
hopefully now you can see just above
where<00:00:53.890> my<00:00:54.159> finger<00:00:54.519> is<00:00:54.549> it<00:00:55.089> now<00:00:55.330> says<00:00:55.570> expert

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
where my finger is it now says expert

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.189 
where my finger is it now says expert
and<00:00:56.470> this<00:00:57.010> button<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.549> flashing<00:00:58.030> now<00:00:58.930> this<00:00:59.110> is

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
and this button is flashing now this is

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.170 
and this button is flashing now this is
expert<00:00:59.589> mode<00:00:59.830> for<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.129> model<00:01:00.400> and<00:01:00.820> what<00:01:01.000> that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
expert mode for the model and what that

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.960 
expert mode for the model and what that
means<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:01.720> that<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.170> end<00:01:03.070> points<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:03.820> the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
means is that the end points and the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.870 
means is that the end points and the
responsiveness<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.869> model<00:01:05.170> have<00:01:05.880> been

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
responsiveness of the model have been

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.030 
responsiveness of the model have been
increased<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.870> that<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.080> can<00:01:08.290> do<00:01:08.470> some<00:01:08.800> more

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
increased so that you can do some more

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.290 
increased so that you can do some more
aggressive<00:01:09.460> flying<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.950> do<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> flip<00:01:12.490> with

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
aggressive flying now to do a flip with

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.910 
aggressive flying now to do a flip with
enough<00:01:13.570> height<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.320> can<00:01:14.470> see<00:01:14.620> one<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:14.860> my

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
enough height and you can see one of my

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.280 
enough height and you can see one of my
other<00:01:15.040> flying<00:01:15.340> videos<00:01:15.730> outside<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.660> see<00:01:17.020> how

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
other flying videos outside to see how

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.520 
other flying videos outside to see how
it<00:01:17.440> flips<00:01:17.710> in<00:01:18.010> action<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.960> actually<00:01:20.320> then

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
it flips in action is to actually then

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.700 
it flips in action is to actually then
go<00:01:21.220> very<00:01:21.580> quickly<00:01:21.880> from<00:01:22.540> left<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.080> right<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.590> if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
go very quickly from left to right so if

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.420 
go very quickly from left to right so if
you<00:01:23.830> wanted<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:24.610> flip<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.710> right<00:01:26.980> you'd

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
you wanted it to flip to the right you'd

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.160 
you wanted it to flip to the right you'd
go<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.850> left<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.240> very<00:01:28.390> quickly<00:01:28.720> flip<00:01:29.050> it

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
go to the left and very quickly flip it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.290 
go to the left and very quickly flip it
across<00:01:29.290> like<00:01:29.680> that<00:01:29.710> if<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.700> wanted<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.150> to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
across like that if you wanted it to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.160 
across like that if you wanted it to
roll<00:01:31.480> forward

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
roll forward

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.610 
roll forward
you'd<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.390> with<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.900> stick<00:01:35.140> if<00:01:35.350> you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
you'd do that with the stick if you

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.080 
you'd do that with the stick if you
wanted<00:01:35.980> it<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.190> roll<00:01:36.460> backwards

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
wanted it to roll backwards

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.210 
wanted it to roll backwards
you'd<00:01:37.480> do<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.720> with<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> stick<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.680> vice

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
you'd do that with a stick and vice

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.030 
you'd do that with a stick and vice
versa<00:01:39.730> so<00:01:40.180> basically<00:01:40.600> by<00:01:41.230> pushing<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.890> and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
versa so basically by pushing it and

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.370 
versa so basically by pushing it and
flicking<00:01:42.730> it<00:01:43.060> from<00:01:43.659> one<00:01:43.840> side<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.320> other

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
flicking it from one side to the other

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.670 
flicking it from one side to the other
you<00:01:44.800> will<00:01:45.220> cause<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.760> flip<00:01:46.120> or<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.360> roll<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:47.080> that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
you will cause a flip or a roll in that

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.880 
you will cause a flip or a roll in that
direction<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:49.659> tip<00:01:49.960> would<00:01:50.080> be<00:01:50.140> make<00:01:50.470> sure<00:01:50.710> that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
direction my tip would be make sure that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.980 
direction my tip would be make sure that
you<00:01:50.979> have<00:01:51.130> enough<00:01:51.370> height<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.850> also<00:01:52.750> make

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
you have enough height and also make

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.930 
you have enough height and also make
sure<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.590> you're<00:01:53.800> actually<00:01:53.950> applying<00:01:54.340> more

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
sure that you're actually applying more

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.480 
sure that you're actually applying more
throttle<00:01:55.270> as<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.350> do<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.770> maneuver<00:01:57.040> because

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
throttle as you do the maneuver because

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.430 
throttle as you do the maneuver because
if<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.970> model<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.420> traveling<00:01:58.960> upward

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
if the model is traveling upward

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.610 
if the model is traveling upward
slightly<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.430> momentum<00:02:01.000> helps<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.600> keep<00:02:02.470> a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
slightly that momentum helps it keep a

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.840 
slightly that momentum helps it keep a
little<00:02:02.860> bit<00:02:02.979> more<00:02:03.159> height<00:02:03.430> through<00:02:03.729> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
little bit more height through the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.930 
little bit more height through the
maneuver<00:02:04.440> hopefully<00:02:05.440> that's<00:02:05.740> useful<00:02:05.979> thanks

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
maneuver hopefully that's useful thanks

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.969 
maneuver hopefully that's useful thanks
