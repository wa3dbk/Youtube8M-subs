00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.710
 what happens family today we will make a 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.540
 trompe l'oeil is a pictorial technique 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.760
 used to try to get a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.500
 intensified reality or substitution of 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.240
 the term reality also used 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.440
 by the cooks when they do imitation 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.750
 of a plate using others 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.210
 ingredients thanks to ask today 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 we will make a chicken curry with mango and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 rice is worth or yes 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.230
 We put the pan on medium heat with a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.689
 little of oil of common we split the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 onions in half to be able 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.640
 cut them much better and the finest 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 possible 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.840
 in a sad sad 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.540
 we add the garlic 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.950
 and let it cook little by little 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.470
 until the onion is like 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.980
 transparent while we continue to sting 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.239
 the apple mango and the tomato 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 we cut the tomato to chop it does not 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.120
 missing that the court is very small 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.120
 first of your work 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.680
 you could remove the skin by winning 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.680
 with three pieces 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 we put the apple in the glass 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.119
 and we will begin to cut him 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 if the mango is very ripe it is normal 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.729
 that undoes and stains a little bit all 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.729
 the kitchen 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.520
 I grabbed a spoon right now 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.050
 but follow this directly with a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.460
 little coconut milk and in the fridge 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.100
 you have an ice cream 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.670
 filipas two soup spoons and a half 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 of curry and then one of turmeric coffee 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.970
 I like to give it a point that a little bit 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.490
 spicy once the onion and the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 garlic you throw turmeric and curry and 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.830
 synergistically remove ten seconds that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.560
 do not burn that if you do not know bad and then 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.290
 at the moment you throw the tomato the mango 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.970
 and the crushed apple you remember and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.610
 you leave about 20 minutes of average game 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.080
 so that it cooks we will take two 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.170
 chicken breasts the cut we will make 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.850
 soldiers and we will put the jump as 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.850
 strong just to color them 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.820
 When the 20 minutes have passed 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.270
 sauce that is cooked we will throw the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.040
 chicken the idea is that first the tomato 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.390
 you have to do a little bit so that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 when you eat the chicken later 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.330
 finish doing with the sauce and lame 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.050
 all the flavor 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.050
 good 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.850
 let's apply the cauliflower in the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.750
 processor to try to give it a 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.480
 rice form 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.610
 there is the idea of ​​trompe l'oeil 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.300
 we split the cauliflower in half for 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.300
 that be more easy 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.230
 fix your hair is a bit with a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.230
 family 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.450
 we sauté 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.340
 the two pellets or that you stay that is 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.170
 the result that we seek to make it look like 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.900
 as loose looking for the texture of 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.900
 it will deploy rice 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.569
 of alpeg or not 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.569
 I think so
