a really immersive experience this is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.399 
a really immersive experience this is
one<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> those<00:01:36.329> games<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
one of those games that really kind of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
one of those games that really kind of
shows<00:01:37.619> off<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.610> connect<00:01:39.329> integration

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
shows off what a connect integration

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.889 
shows off what a connect integration
could<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.640> developers<00:01:42.150> really

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
could be like if more developers really

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
could be like if more developers really
put<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.439> into<00:01:43.649> thinking<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.280> what

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
put the time into thinking about what

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.859 
put the time into thinking about what
connect<00:01:45.210> means<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.439> game<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.570> like<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.689> say

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
connect means to a game and like I say

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.749 
connect means to a game and like I say
it<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> most<00:01:49.890> beautiful<00:01:50.220> looking

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
it is one of the most beautiful looking

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
it is one of the most beautiful looking
