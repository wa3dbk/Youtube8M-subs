and<00:00:05.130> today<00:00:05.670> we're<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.029> be<00:00:06.180> talking<00:00:06.330> a

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
and today we're going to be talking a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.600 
and today we're going to be talking a
little<00:00:06.690> bit<00:00:06.839> about<00:00:07.259> olympic<00:00:07.770> lifting<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
little bit about olympic lifting and the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.549 
little bit about olympic lifting and the
bar<00:00:08.790> path<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.450> olympic<00:00:09.750> lifting<00:00:10.019> so

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
bar path when we're olympic lifting so

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.070 
bar path when we're olympic lifting so
the<00:00:13.559> bar<00:00:13.799> path<00:00:14.040> basics<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> bar<00:00:15.839> path

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
the bar path basics so the bar path

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680 
the bar path basics so the bar path
essentially<00:00:16.800> refers<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.119> path<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
essentially refers to the path of the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.580 
essentially refers to the path of the
bar<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.199> viewed<00:00:19.590> directly<00:00:19.830> from<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> side

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
bar when viewed directly from the side

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.250 
bar when viewed directly from the side
so<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.279> usually<00:00:23.760> refers<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.720> snatch<00:00:25.019> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
so this usually refers to the snatch of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.689 
so this usually refers to the snatch of
the<00:00:25.350> clean<00:00:25.590> oil<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.039> also<00:00:26.189> analyze<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the clean oil you can also analyze the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.730 
the clean oil you can also analyze the
jerk<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:27.840> usually<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.199> straight<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> down

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
jerk but usually it straight up and down

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.179 
jerk but usually it straight up and down
so<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.130> not<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.400> important<00:00:30.740> today<00:00:31.740> we're

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so it's not as important today we're

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
so it's not as important today we're
going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.460> focusing<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.270> snatch<00:00:33.540> well

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
going to be focusing on the snatch well

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.870 
going to be focusing on the snatch well
the<00:00:34.170> same<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.440> applies<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> clean<00:00:35.460> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the same thing applies to the clean so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.540 
the same thing applies to the clean so
first<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.380> what's<00:00:37.739> called<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> first

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
first up we have what's called the first

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.670 
first up we have what's called the first
pole<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:40.110> pole<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:42.230> went<00:00:43.230> from<00:00:43.469> when

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
pole now first pole is went from when

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.200 
pole now first pole is went from when
the<00:00:43.770> barbell<00:00:44.100> starts<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> ground<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the barbell starts on the ground to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.119 
the barbell starts on the ground to
write<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.860> start<00:00:47.190> your<00:00:47.370> jump<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> what

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
write when you start your jump so what

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.229 
write when you start your jump so what
you're<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> barbell

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you're going to see is the barbell

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.279 
you're going to see is the barbell
starts<00:00:52.100> right<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.550> where<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> big<00:00:54.989> toe

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
starts right about where that big toe

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.220 
starts right about where that big toe
runs<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:56.039> foot<00:00:56.780> you're<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> start

runs in your foot you're going to start

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
runs in your foot you're going to start
by<00:00:58.500> getting<00:00:59.070> nice<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.250> tight<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.760> stiff

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
by getting nice and tight and stiff

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.330 
by getting nice and tight and stiff
you're<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.739> deadlift<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> bar<00:01:02.129> up

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you're going to deadlift the bar up

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
you're going to deadlift the bar up
sweeping<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> bar<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.049> into<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.409> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
you can break it into three pieces

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.289 
you can break it into three pieces
there's<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.260> first<00:03:52.650> pole<00:03:52.950> where<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.580> sweet<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
there's a first pole where I sweet the

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.570 
there's a first pole where I sweet the
bar<00:03:54.480> back<00:03:54.630> into<00:03:54.870> me<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.200> deadlift<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
bar back into me it's a deadlift the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.000 
bar back into me it's a deadlift the
second<00:03:57.180> pole<00:03:57.360> as<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.600> jump<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.470> bar<00:03:58.650> still

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
second pole as I jump and the bar still

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.199 
second pole as I jump and the bar still
continues<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.850> come<00:04:00.000> back<00:04:00.180> into<00:04:00.360> my<00:04:00.540> hips<00:04:00.750> I

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
continues to come back into my hips I

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.300 
continues to come back into my hips I
then<00:04:03.209> reach<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.450> third<00:04:04.049> pole<00:04:04.440> where<00:04:05.070> I've<00:04:05.160> now

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
then reach the third pole where I've now

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.860 
then reach the third pole where I've now
actually<00:04:05.640> start<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:05.940> pull<00:04:06.180> myself<00:04:06.330> onto<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
actually start to pull myself onto the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.930 
actually start to pull myself onto the
bar<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.320> bar<00:04:07.500> starts<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.040> come<00:04:08.220> away<00:04:08.370> from<00:04:08.790> me

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
bar the bar starts to come away from me

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.000 
bar the bar starts to come away from me
and<00:04:09.150> then<00:04:09.840> back<00:04:10.019> towards<00:04:10.440> me<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.860> get

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
and then back towards me as I get

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.789 
and then back towards me as I get
underneath<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:13.290> catch<00:04:13.530> were

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
underneath it and the catch were

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.350 
underneath it and the catch were
actually<00:04:14.190> catch<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.610> barbell<00:04:14.940> nice<00:04:15.120> and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
actually catch the barbell nice and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.759 
actually catch the barbell nice and
solid<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.780> bottom<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.080> my<00:04:16.200> overhead<00:04:16.500> squat

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
solid in the bottom of my overhead squat

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.460 
solid in the bottom of my overhead squat
I<00:04:17.010> would<00:04:17.430> then<00:04:17.549> stand<00:04:18.030> up<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:18.510> finish<00:04:19.440> my<00:04:20.100> left

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
I would then stand up or finish my left

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.990 
I would then stand up or finish my left
so<00:04:22.470> that's<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.610> bar<00:04:23.910> path

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
so that's the bar path

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.200 
so that's the bar path
in<00:04:25.240> its<00:04:25.810> entirety<00:04:28.860> now<00:04:29.860> some<00:04:30.340> really<00:04:30.760> common

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
in its entirety now some really common

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.090 
in its entirety now some really common
errors<00:04:31.630> in<00:04:33.300> bar<00:04:34.300> path<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:35.650> allow<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.920> to

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
errors in bar path that allow you to

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.510 
errors in bar path that allow you to
read<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.760> bar<00:04:37.000> path<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.570> then<00:04:37.890> critique<00:04:38.890> it<00:04:39.070> so

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
read a bar path and then critique it so

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640 
read a bar path and then critique it so
if<00:04:39.790> this<00:04:40.000> is<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.300> ideal<00:04:40.750> bar<00:04:41.050> path<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.530> we're

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
if this is the ideal bar path that we're

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.230 
if this is the ideal bar path that we're
always<00:04:41.770> looking<00:04:41.980> for<00:04:42.190> this<00:04:42.850> good<00:04:43.380> s-curve

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
always looking for this good s-curve

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.930 
always looking for this good s-curve
some<00:04:46.240> common<00:04:46.690> errors<00:04:46.840> are<00:04:47.640> letting<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.790> bar

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
some common errors are letting the bar

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940 
some common errors are letting the bar
come<00:04:49.150> away<00:04:49.360> from<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.660> off<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.990> floor<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.830> if

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
come away from you off the floor so if

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.570 
come away from you off the floor so if
you<00:04:51.040> imagine<00:04:51.160> our<00:04:51.610> little<00:04:51.820> guy<00:04:51.970> again<00:04:52.500> if<00:04:53.580> the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
you imagine our little guy again if the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.220 
you imagine our little guy again if the
bar<00:04:54.790> actually<00:04:55.210> starts<00:04:55.510> to<00:04:55.630> come<00:04:55.810> away<00:04:56.170> from

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
bar actually starts to come away from

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.770 
bar actually starts to come away from
you<00:04:56.740> you've<00:04:57.550> lost<00:04:57.790> all<00:04:58.060> your<00:04:58.090> leverage<00:04:58.510> in<00:04:58.660> the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
you you've lost all your leverage in the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.940 
you you've lost all your leverage in the
lift<00:04:58.930> so<00:04:59.050> it's<00:04:59.169> going<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.320> be<00:04:59.410> very<00:04:59.470> hard<00:04:59.890> to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
lift so it's going to be very hard to

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.500 
lift so it's going to be very hard to
save<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.370> lift<00:05:00.580> as<00:05:00.760> soon<00:05:00.910> as<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.120> barbell

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
save that lift as soon as that barbell

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.240 
save that lift as soon as that barbell
comes<00:05:01.750> away<00:05:01.870> from<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.680> can<00:05:02.800> see<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.980> couple

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
comes away from you you can see a couple

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.130 
comes away from you you can see a couple
different<00:05:03.460> bar<00:05:03.910> patterns<00:05:04.330> here<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.990> is

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
different bar patterns here this is

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.360 
different bar patterns here this is
where<00:05:05.230> it<00:05:05.350> stays<00:05:05.590> out<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:05.919> front<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.250> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
where it stays out in front of you the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.710 
where it stays out in front of you the
whole<00:05:06.400> time<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.940> never<00:05:07.030> really<00:05:07.360> bring<00:05:07.630> it

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
whole time you never really bring it

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.650 
whole time you never really bring it
into<00:05:07.840> it's<00:05:08.560> very<00:05:08.740> close<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.820> beginner

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
into it's very close to a beginner

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.040 
into it's very close to a beginner
movement<00:05:11.310> this<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.550> also<00:05:13.390> called<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.840> reverse

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
movement this is also called the reverse

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.470 
movement this is also called the reverse
three<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.340> comes<00:05:15.520> away<00:05:15.760> from<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:16.360> then

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
three so it comes away from you but then

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480 
three so it comes away from you but then
you<00:05:16.510> actually<00:05:16.900> pull<00:05:17.140> it<00:05:17.230> back<00:05:17.380> in<00:05:17.650> but<00:05:18.340> then

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
you actually pull it back in but then

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.830 
you actually pull it back in but then
you<00:05:18.580> kind<00:05:18.730> of<00:05:18.820> bang<00:05:19.030> your<00:05:19.210> hips<00:05:19.360> into<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.690> and

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
you kind of bang your hips into it and

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.890 
you kind of bang your hips into it and
it<00:05:19.930> goes<00:05:20.050> out<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:20.470> away<00:05:20.560> again<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.100> so

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
it goes out and away again and so

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.000 
it goes out and away again and so
anytime<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:22.930> bar<00:05:23.320> comes<00:05:23.530> away<00:05:23.650> from<00:05:23.919> you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
anytime that bar comes away from you

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.440 
anytime that bar comes away from you
it's<00:05:24.130> going<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.310> be<00:05:24.400> very<00:05:24.430> hard<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:24.910> lift<00:05:25.270> a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
it's going to be very hard to lift a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.150 
it's going to be very hard to lift a
heavy<00:05:25.570> weight<00:05:25.870> you'll<00:05:26.470> get<00:05:26.680> away<00:05:26.830> with<00:05:26.980> it<00:05:27.070> at

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
heavy weight you'll get away with it at

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.100 
heavy weight you'll get away with it at
the<00:05:27.280> lighter<00:05:27.460> weights<00:05:27.700> but<00:05:28.000> as<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.990> get

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
the lighter weights but as you get

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.690 
the lighter weights but as you get
heavier<00:05:29.470> it's<00:05:29.710> going<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:29.890> be<00:05:29.950> very<00:05:29.979> very<00:05:30.460> hard

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
heavier it's going to be very very hard

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.400 
heavier it's going to be very very hard
to<00:05:30.880> save<00:05:31.120> list<00:05:31.450> once<00:05:31.720> they<00:05:31.870> start<00:05:32.110> going<00:05:32.200> away

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
to save list once they start going away

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.409 
to save list once they start going away
from<00:05:32.650> your<00:05:32.800> body<00:05:34.169> another<00:05:35.169> common<00:05:35.620> error<00:05:35.979> is

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
from your body another common error is

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.450 
from your body another common error is
going<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.510> be<00:05:37.600> all<00:05:37.780> hips<00:05:38.169> so<00:05:38.979> if<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.160> ever<00:05:39.280> have

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
going to be all hips so if you ever have

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.820 
going to be all hips so if you ever have
seen<00:05:39.640> anybody<00:05:39.910> bang<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.540> bar<00:05:40.780> or<00:05:41.080> keep<00:05:41.680> their

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
seen anybody bang a bar or keep their

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.260 
seen anybody bang a bar or keep their
arms<00:05:41.979> straight<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.460> whole<00:05:42.580> time<00:05:42.820> as<00:05:43.060> they<00:05:43.150> get

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
arms straight the whole time as they get

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.409 
arms straight the whole time as they get
under<00:05:43.540> a<00:05:43.810> lift<00:05:44.290> this<00:05:44.740> is<00:05:44.860> going<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.040> be<00:05:45.419> similar

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
under a lift this is going to be similar

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.170 
under a lift this is going to be similar
to<00:05:46.660> this<00:05:46.990> bar<00:05:47.229> path<00:05:47.470> now<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:48.490> one<00:05:48.700> on<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:48.880> left

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
to this bar path now the one on the left

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.770 
to this bar path now the one on the left
is<00:05:49.540> actually<00:05:50.080> okay<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:51.340> it's<00:05:51.520> step<00:05:51.880> good<00:05:52.300> sweep

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
is actually okay so it's step good sweep

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.050 
is actually okay so it's step good sweep
off<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.169> floor<00:05:53.410> back<00:05:53.680> in<00:05:53.890> my<00:05:54.010> hips<00:05:54.250> now<00:05:54.880> I'm

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
off the floor back in my hips now I'm

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.490 
off the floor back in my hips now I'm
going<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.270> get<00:05:55.479> a<00:05:55.690> little<00:05:55.900> bit<00:05:56.140> more<00:05:56.290> hip

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
going to get a little bit more hip

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.020 
going to get a little bit more hip
action<00:05:56.710> so<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:57.100> see<00:05:57.280> it<00:05:57.370> more<00:05:57.700> comes<00:05:57.910> away

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
action so you see it more comes away

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.590 
action so you see it more comes away
from<00:05:58.510> my<00:05:58.600> body<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.160> then<00:06:00.160> a<00:06:00.190> catch<00:06:00.520> but<00:06:01.210> if<00:06:01.450> you

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
from my body and then a catch but if you

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.370 
from my body and then a catch but if you
notice<00:06:02.020> this<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.290> still<00:06:02.680> very<00:06:03.160> close<00:06:04.229> to<00:06:05.229> this

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
notice this is still very close to this

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.880 
notice this is still very close to this
reverse<00:06:05.919> s-curve<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:06.760> different<00:06:07.450> lifters

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
reverse s-curve and different lifters

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.040 
reverse s-curve and different lifters
move<00:06:08.890> differently<00:06:09.160> but<00:06:10.000> because<00:06:10.630> it's<00:06:10.840> so

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
move differently but because it's so

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.530 
move differently but because it's so
close<00:06:11.470> that's<00:06:12.130> actually<00:06:12.400> an<00:06:12.700> okay<00:06:13.030> lift<00:06:13.270> and

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
close that's actually an okay lift and

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.180 
close that's actually an okay lift and
many<00:06:13.900> lifters<00:06:14.290> are<00:06:14.410> taught<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.650> way<00:06:14.950> many

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
many lifters are taught that way many

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.950 
many lifters are taught that way many
coaches<00:06:15.430> teach<00:06:15.760> it<00:06:15.910> that<00:06:16.060> way<00:06:16.180> it's<00:06:16.630> just<00:06:16.750> a

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
coaches teach it that way it's just a

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.540 
coaches teach it that way it's just a
variation<00:06:17.260> style<00:06:17.800> there's<00:06:18.070> no<00:06:18.250> real

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
variation style there's no real

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.370 
variation style there's no real
difference<00:06:18.760> in<00:06:19.180> the<00:06:19.450> quality<00:06:19.630> of<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.050> lifting

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
difference in the quality of the lifting

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.469 
difference in the quality of the lifting
the<00:06:20.919> one<00:06:21.100> on<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.280> right<00:06:21.310> though<00:06:21.910> is<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.360> one

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
the one on the right though is the one

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.659 
the one on the right though is the one
we<00:06:22.600> want<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.260> really<00:06:23.470> avoid<00:06:23.890> so<00:06:24.160> what<00:06:24.280> you<00:06:24.400> see

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
we want to really avoid so what you see

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.530 
we want to really avoid so what you see
is<00:06:24.700> that<00:06:25.630> good<00:06:26.140> sweep<00:06:26.860> but<00:06:27.520> now<00:06:27.820> it's<00:06:28.090> it's<00:06:28.419> a

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
is that good sweep but now it's it's a

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.380 
is that good sweep but now it's it's a
really<00:06:28.810> big<00:06:29.050> hit<00:06:29.320> bang<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.340> it<00:06:30.760> comes<00:06:30.970> out<00:06:31.210> and

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
really big hit bang and it comes out and

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.330 
really big hit bang and it comes out and
away<00:06:31.479> from<00:06:31.660> you<00:06:31.930> in<00:06:32.020> this<00:06:32.140> big<00:06:32.350> arc<00:06:32.620> then<00:06:33.160> what

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
away from you in this big arc then what

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.580 
away from you in this big arc then what
happens<00:06:33.700> is<00:06:33.910> and<00:06:34.210> that<00:06:34.599> really<00:06:34.780> big<00:06:35.050> arc<00:06:35.289> it's

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
happens is and that really big arc it's

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.279 
happens is and that really big arc it's
hard<00:06:35.890> to<00:06:36.010> catch<00:06:36.700> the<00:06:36.940> bar<00:06:37.120> in<00:06:37.210> a<00:06:37.270> good<00:06:37.450> position

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
hard to catch the bar in a good position

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.019 
hard to catch the bar in a good position
it<00:06:38.409> will<00:06:38.529> lose<00:06:38.649> it<00:06:38.800> in<00:06:38.889> front<00:06:39.189> it<00:06:39.669> was<00:06:39.879> it

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:40.029 
it will lose it in front it was it

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:42.089 
it will lose it in front it was it
behind<00:06:40.360> but<00:06:40.719> it's<00:06:40.839> going<00:06:41.259> to<00:06:41.319> be<00:06:41.409> very<00:06:41.710> hard<00:06:42.009> to

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
behind but it's going to be very hard to

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:44.549 
behind but it's going to be very hard to
catch<00:06:42.399> it<00:06:42.639> right<00:06:43.300> at<00:06:43.449> that<00:06:43.599> perfect<00:06:43.960> position

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:44.559 
catch it right at that perfect position

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.019 
catch it right at that perfect position
where<00:06:44.680> you<00:06:44.740> can<00:06:44.860> actually<00:06:45.009> catch<00:06:45.430> the<00:06:45.669> barbell

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:46.029 
where you can actually catch the barbell

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:51.809 
where you can actually catch the barbell
in<00:06:46.180> a<00:06:46.270> good<00:06:46.419> spot<00:06:47.219> so<00:06:48.219> all<00:06:49.149> hips<00:06:50.099> out<00:06:51.099> the<00:06:51.490> front

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
in a good spot so all hips out the front

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.369 
in a good spot so all hips out the front
two<00:06:52.089> big<00:06:52.330> things<00:06:52.539> you<00:06:52.749> want<00:06:52.899> to<00:06:52.960> avoid<00:06:53.169> when

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379 
two big things you want to avoid when

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:57.179 
two big things you want to avoid when
you're<00:06:53.529> looking<00:06:54.039> at<00:06:54.129> a<00:06:54.189> bar<00:06:54.369> path<00:06:56.009> that<00:06:57.009> would

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 
you're looking at a bar path that would

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:58.859 
you're looking at a bar path that would
be<00:06:57.369> ideal<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:57.939> closer<00:06:58.240> you<00:06:58.479> can<00:06:58.569> get<00:06:58.689> to<00:06:58.839> that

00:06:58.859 --> 00:06:58.869 
be ideal the closer you can get to that

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:01.709 
be ideal the closer you can get to that
perfect<00:06:59.649> s-curve<00:07:00.490> the<00:07:01.029> better<00:07:01.270> it's<00:07:01.509> going<00:07:01.629> to

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
perfect s-curve the better it's going to

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.329 
perfect s-curve the better it's going to
be<00:07:01.869> everybody's<00:07:02.080> going<00:07:03.009> to<00:07:03.039> have<00:07:03.159> a<00:07:03.219> little

00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:03.339 
be everybody's going to have a little

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.399 
be everybody's going to have a little
bit<00:07:03.460> of<00:07:03.550> differences<00:07:04.089> but<00:07:04.659> overall<00:07:05.020> that's

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
bit of differences but overall that's

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.339 
bit of differences but overall that's
what<00:07:05.559> we're<00:07:05.680> shooting<00:07:05.800> for<00:07:05.979> every<00:07:06.339> time<00:07:07.349> so

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349 
what we're shooting for every time so

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:10.230 
what we're shooting for every time so
hopefully<00:07:09.159> that<00:07:09.339> gave<00:07:09.520> you<00:07:09.669> guys<00:07:09.819> a<00:07:09.849> pretty

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
hopefully that gave you guys a pretty

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.939 
hopefully that gave you guys a pretty
good<00:07:10.360> understanding<00:07:10.509> of<00:07:11.080> the<00:07:11.229> bar<00:07:11.409> path<00:07:11.649> and

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
good understanding of the bar path and

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.679 
good understanding of the bar path and
what<00:07:12.399> we're<00:07:12.580> looking<00:07:12.909> for<00:07:15.029> now<00:07:16.029> time<00:07:16.479> to<00:07:16.599> go

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:16.689 
what we're looking for now time to go

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.139 
what we're looking for now time to go
play<00:07:16.899> with<00:07:17.020> it
