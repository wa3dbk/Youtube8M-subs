came in and the end result

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.010 
came in and the end result
let's<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> end<00:00:52.110> result<00:00:53.270> was<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
let's do this the end result was this a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
let's do this the end result was this a
you<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.649> before<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you see before you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.470 
you see before you
I<00:00:56.600> mean<00:00:58.340> here's<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.460> normal<00:00:59.730> die

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I mean here's a normal die

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.270 
I mean here's a normal die
and<00:01:01.670> that's<00:01:03.170> about<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.470> size<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.280> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and that's about the size of it so I can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.950 
and that's about the size of it so I can
see<00:01:09.500> it's<00:01:10.820> pretty<00:01:11.820> much<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.330> cutest<00:01:12.689> thing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

ever
I've<00:01:14.610> never<00:01:14.909> seen<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> dice<00:01:15.630> tower<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.350> that's

small<00:01:17.250> before<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.750> very

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
small before it was very it was very

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.980 
small before it was very it was very
easy<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.470> put<00:01:19.650> together<00:01:20.509> probably<00:01:21.509> great<00:01:21.810> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
easy to put together probably great for
