 folk choir genetics julie julia roberts 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 papa people myself at their start and today 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 mentally train with the topic 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.930
 versus train in theory and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.660
 why I believe that many of you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.650
 do not succeed with your trainings 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 principle and that should not now 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.750
 promotional video while for the forest but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 just for you to think and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 Although I see every day that's really 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.420
 actually almost one of the most common 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 ask is what the training plan should 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.180
 I drive 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 How should I train which plan 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.760
 do you have what plan has person xyz 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 which person does how do you do that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 how many sentences how many repetitions 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.120
 and those are the people who are on the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.339
 looking for the perfect plan understands 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 you eat the people who do not start 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.369
 before they do not think that up now 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.290
 the perfect way to do that and that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.729
 problem with that is it does not exist 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 perfect workout plan 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.759
 but I do not want to go outside 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 then the people you are then in 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.270
 Look around the gym with these plans 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.920
 hobble and walk around and then really 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 just train like little professionals 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 in a good German way 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.299
 to express that means the people there 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 I'm constantly tinkering in theory 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.750
 I myself am the first extreme 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.640
 Theoretical training I have 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 my firm conviction what is thailand 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.299
 People are concerned about frequency 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 as far as planned training is concerned 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.100
 Everything aspects definitely one 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 play role but I forget that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.970
 basic principle still not and indeed 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.719
 is called the beast mode going in training 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.430
 that means we can still do so perfectly 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.040
 elaborated training plans still have 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 so much theoretical knowledge and also 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.920
 the people who bassist my life 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.720
 buy you can 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 assume that if you do not then 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.560
 At least even the motivation you 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.560
 that looked and really you guys 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.170
 After that I really rips the ass off 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.330
 depends on the training and not there three 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.150
 raps research stopped knowing where they were 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.980
 training does half the exercises 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 exchanged I suggested yes 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.170
 squats that is not out of this 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.370
 reason kreuzheben yes that that 's there 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.140
 i have problems there i get 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.640
 here at the skin so so small hump 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.370
 and so what I already heard everything 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.440
 have that partly disgusts me the whole 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.630
 already blatantly so people are themselves 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.060
 really not already in the ass 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.100
 But then tear still under 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410
 every facebook post at every type 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.040
 any questions ask theoretical 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.510
 ask that is the deadline at all times 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.790
 Here you have to go to the theory 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.160
 simply times your methane aspect so 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.739
 a bit under control have really that 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.260
 want is important that in training gas 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.750
 give yourself that body times like that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.209
 to put knowledge into itself that is 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.090
 Feel 1 fc upper body too 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.859
 to really feel that means yourself 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.299
 thoughts are involved in the training 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.250
 Do not listen to the headphones all the time 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.109
 I now feel what people are talking about 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.900
 that I really want to exercise okay 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.670
 now I make time something makes times 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 a bit faster grow slower 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.010
 and then you will realize that it never 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.739
 the perfect guide to the gear 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.150
 for me they are extremely explosive and the 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.709
 negative is very fast 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.560
 there are exercises there is the negative 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.579
 always nice and slow and there then useful 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.410
 it's also not aimed at small ones 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.440
 to take a fucking theory but 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.440
 try to get to know your body 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.060
 that is very important as I said and also 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.340
 I always go back in love 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.670
 small because I just can not do that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.260
 The training system wanted to invent that for 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.790
 everyone works the same but me 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.709
 I encourage people everywhere 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.989
 always a bit certain 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.680
 nevertheless still individually to things 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.470
 let's you understand and yes just that 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.510
 you've heard this way for you 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.470
 maybe you ask yourself is 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.989
 it really so important now 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.959
 people that run with a stopwatch in 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.900
 I'm always so horny 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.350
 So no matter so hopefully I hope you 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.300
 know what I mean by that lives in the gym 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.940
 Full throttle since in any case sure that 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.430
 you tear your ass properly 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.470
 that she is in pain, that he is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 it loves pushing you to the limits 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.610
 every week is better 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.160
 that she feels the muscles that you 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.010
 once you will be with your body and then 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.720
 the things ever bring along then 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.920
 can you then start the theoreticians 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.130
 to play and then a little bit more 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.820
 to work out the fine tuning for you 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.720
 that's it then 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.250
 Step 2 that is the hardware and the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.370
 software has to be right 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.780
 and then you come to success people and 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.900
 that's what I am with him 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.190
 videos answer from now goes now 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.760
 Exercise makes you a nice one 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.610
 Eve 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.610
 you see yourself t shirt
