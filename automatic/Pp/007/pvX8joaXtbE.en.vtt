00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.730 

slide<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.240> little<00:02:18.600> bit<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.780> glue<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.230> hold<00:02:19.620> it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
slide a little bit of glue I hold it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.860 
slide a little bit of glue I hold it
with<00:02:19.890> my<00:02:19.920> tweezer<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.690> those

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
with my tweezer and on one of those

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.559 
with my tweezer and on one of those
projections<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:24.000> adhere<00:02:24.420> it

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
projections I'm going to just adhere it

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.100 
projections I'm going to just adhere it
and<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.650> every<00:02:26.310> other<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:28.080> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and I do that every other one and then I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.160 
and I do that every other one and then I
put<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> all<00:02:29.550> together<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> last<00:02:30.780> ones

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
put it all together with the last ones

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.190 
put it all together with the last ones
to<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.130> now<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:32.910> leaves<00:02:33.209> are<00:02:33.569> done<00:02:33.959> on

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to get this now your leaves are done on

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.509 
to get this now your leaves are done on
the<00:02:34.319> leaf<00:02:34.530> mat<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.110> I'm<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.100> use<00:02:38.280> that

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
the leaf mat and I'm going to use that

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.660 
the leaf mat and I'm going to use that
leaf<00:02:38.790> tool<00:02:39.090> again<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.130> right<00:02:41.340> side

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
leaf tool again on the if the right side

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.420 
leaf tool again on the if the right side
down<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.200> leaf<00:02:43.380> tool<00:02:43.680> I'm<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
down with that leaf tool I'm going to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.729 
down with that leaf tool I'm going to
add<00:02:44.580> what<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.910> call<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.300> stem<00:02:45.660> lying<00:02:45.989> down<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
add what I call a stem lying down and

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.190 
add what I call a stem lying down and
because<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.880> doesn't<00:02:48.209> have<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> definition<00:02:49.080> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
because it doesn't have a definition of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.860 
because it doesn't have a definition of
veining<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.070> does<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.459> striations<00:02:51.150> I'm

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
veining but it does have striations I'm

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.040 
veining but it does have striations I'm
going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.410> also<00:02:53.180> make<00:02:54.180> some<00:02:54.360> striation<00:02:55.019> marks

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
going to also make some striation marks

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.030 
going to also make some striation marks
on<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.860> right<00:02:56.220> side<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.540> paper

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
on that right side of that of the paper

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
on that right side of that of the paper
again<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.550> little<00:02:59.820> bit<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.120> pinching<00:03:00.570> at<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
again a little bit of pinching at the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.320 
again a little bit of pinching at the
end<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:02.430> little<00:03:02.700> bit<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.910> crimping<00:03:03.590> and

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
end and a little bit of crimping and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.750 
end and a little bit of crimping and
what<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.510> do<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:07.069> then<00:03:08.069> once<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.489> set<00:03:08.730> your

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
what you do is then once you set your

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.720 
what you do is then once you set your
flower<00:03:09.180> tuck<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> under<00:03:10.320> now<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.980> notice<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
flower tuck it under now you notice the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.800 
flower tuck it under now you notice the
stamens<00:03:12.360> are<00:03:12.870> also<00:03:13.769> cut<00:03:14.450> we're<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.660> add

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
stamens are also cut we're going to add

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.960 
stamens are also cut we're going to add
a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:16.079> bit<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> color<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> ends

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.120 

then<00:03:24.660> you're<00:03:24.870> going<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.170> add<00:03:25.470> some<00:03:25.500> color<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
then you're going to add some color to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.430 
then you're going to add some color to
your<00:03:26.370> your<00:03:27.180> statement<00:03:27.990> both<00:03:28.680> sides<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:30.440> then

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
your your statement both sides and then

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.880 
your your statement both sides and then
what<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.770> do<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:33.090> little<00:03:33.990> bit<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.470> glue

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.450 

I<00:03:39.750> only<00:03:40.750> use<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.200> crafters<00:03:41.680> pick<00:03:41.800> because<00:03:42.340> it

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
I only use the crafters pick because it

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
I only use the crafters pick because it
dries<00:03:42.730> quickly<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:44.140> also<00:03:44.970> dries<00:03:45.970> clear<00:03:46.300> so

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
dries quickly and it also dries clear so

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.410 
dries quickly and it also dries clear so
on<00:03:46.959> all<00:03:47.230> my<00:03:47.410> project<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.069> never<00:03:48.310> see<00:03:48.670> any<00:03:49.209> glue

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
on all my project you never see any glue

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.120 
on all my project you never see any glue
so<00:03:49.930> if<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.080> take<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.290> toothpick<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:50.890> then

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
so if you take a toothpick and then

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.850 
so if you take a toothpick and then
start<00:03:51.970> rolling<00:03:52.180> towards<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.110> glue<00:03:55.709> roll<00:03:56.709> it

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
start rolling towards that glue roll it

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.650 
start rolling towards that glue roll it
around<00:03:56.980> your<00:03:57.550> hands<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.880> little<00:03:58.060> bit<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.360> seal

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
around your hands a little bit and seal

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.230 
around your hands a little bit and seal
it<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.080> then<00:03:59.170> remove<00:03:59.740> the<00:04:00.040> tweezers<00:04:00.520> I'll

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
it and then remove the tweezers I'll

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.500 
it and then remove the tweezers I'll
I'll<00:04:01.660> fan<00:04:02.170> them<00:04:02.380> out<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.000> then<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.150> take

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
I'll fan them out and then I can take

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.160 
I'll fan them out and then I can take
glue<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.200> place<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:07.030> little<00:04:07.630> pistol

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
glue and place on the the little pistol

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.210 
glue and place on the the little pistol
ends<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:09.550> your<00:04:09.610> stamen<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.890> make<00:04:12.070> them

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
ends of your stamen and to make them

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.319 
ends of your stamen and to make them
even<00:04:12.520> more<00:04:12.550> lifelike<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:14.370> dip<00:04:15.370> them<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.790> what

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
even more lifelike I dip them in what

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.710 
even more lifelike I dip them in what
it's<00:04:16.570> woodland<00:04:17.079> Scenic's<00:04:17.820> powder<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
it's woodland Scenic's powder and you

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.850 
it's woodland Scenic's powder and you
get<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.190> pretty<00:04:21.910> texture<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.900> pollen<00:04:23.410> yeah

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
get is a pretty texture the pollen yeah

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.830 
get is a pretty texture the pollen yeah
that<00:04:24.490> doesn't<00:04:24.700> you<00:04:25.060> know<00:04:25.090> make<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.540> sneeze

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
that doesn't you know make you sneeze

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.520 
that doesn't you know make you sneeze
mm-hmm<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:26.919> then<00:04:27.700> finally<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.419> just<00:04:28.780> dipped

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
mm-hmm and then finally it's just dipped

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.650 
mm-hmm and then finally it's just dipped
