hey what is up guys today I wanted to
share<00:00:03.820> a<00:00:04.319> free<00:00:05.319> program<00:00:05.589> that<00:00:05.890> allows<00:00:06.339> you<00:00:06.549> to

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:06.789 
share a free program that allows you to

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.270 
share a free program that allows you to
basically<00:00:07.479> run<00:00:07.959> an<00:00:08.200> emulator<00:00:08.740> on<00:00:08.830> your

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
basically run an emulator on your

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.470 
basically run an emulator on your
computer<00:00:09.790> whether<00:00:10.450> it's<00:00:10.960> a<00:00:11.110> gameboy<00:00:12.030> game<00:00:13.030> or

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
computer whether it's a gameboy game or

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.710 
computer whether it's a gameboy game or
a<00:00:13.900> nintendo<00:00:14.560> DS<00:00:14.740> game<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:16.029> can<00:00:16.209> actually<00:00:16.539> run

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
a nintendo DS game you can actually run

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.540 
a nintendo DS game you can actually run
all<00:00:16.749> that<00:00:17.199> on<00:00:17.410> your<00:00:17.499> computer<00:00:17.949> and<00:00:18.099> this<00:00:18.310> I

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
all that on your computer and this I

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.880 
all that on your computer and this I
think<00:00:18.759> is<00:00:19.359> the<00:00:19.720> best<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.199> the<00:00:20.320> most<00:00:20.349> intuitive

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
think is the best and the most intuitive

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.029 
think is the best and the most intuitive
one<00:00:21.369> that<00:00:21.999> you<00:00:22.179> can<00:00:22.359> use<00:00:22.599> so<00:00:23.230> it's<00:00:23.470> called<00:00:23.650> open

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
one that you can use so it's called open

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.569 
one that you can use so it's called open
em<00:00:24.279> you<00:00:25.019> open<00:00:26.019> emulator<00:00:26.470> basically<00:00:27.279> I<00:00:27.310> mean

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
em you open emulator basically I mean

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.359 
em you open emulator basically I mean
that's<00:00:28.569> what<00:00:28.779> it's<00:00:28.900> called<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.369> essentially

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
that's what it's called and essentially

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.620 
that's what it's called and essentially
it<00:00:30.699> runs<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.650> can<00:00:33.430> run<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:33.940> game<00:00:34.180> on<00:00:34.210> your

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
it runs a you can run a game on your

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.890 
it runs a you can run a game on your
computer<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.320> so<00:00:36.060> you<00:00:37.060> can<00:00:37.210> look<00:00:37.330> up<00:00:37.510> where

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
computer and so you can look up where

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.160 
computer and so you can look up where
you<00:00:37.960> can<00:00:38.200> download<00:00:38.740> emulators<00:00:39.690> online<00:00:40.690> they

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
you can download emulators online they

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.930 
you can download emulators online they
can<00:00:41.200> be<00:00:41.440> free<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.980> might<00:00:42.160> have<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.730> pay<00:00:42.880> for

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
can be free you might have to pay for

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.740 
can be free you might have to pay for
them<00:00:43.120> but<00:00:44.310> let's<00:00:45.310> just<00:00:45.400> go<00:00:45.670> through<00:00:45.970> how<00:00:46.390> you

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
them but let's just go through how you

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.880 
them but let's just go through how you
know<00:00:47.080> how<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.710> can<00:00:47.830> use<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.310> nicely<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.710> to

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
know how you can use this nicely and to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.150 
know how you can use this nicely and to
its<00:00:51.010> full<00:00:51.160> potential<00:00:51.610> so<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.930> here<00:00:53.440> there<00:00:53.830> are

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
its full potential so in here there are

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.230 
its full potential so in here there are
a<00:00:55.200> limited<00:00:56.200> amount<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:57.030> consoles<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.060> you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
a limited amount of consoles that you

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.710 
a limited amount of consoles that you
can<00:00:58.390> run<00:00:58.630> but<00:00:59.220> there<00:01:00.220> are<00:01:00.280> ones<00:01:00.490> that<00:01:00.579> I<00:01:00.730> would

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
can run but there are ones that I would

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.380 
can run but there are ones that I would
I<00:01:01.990> guess<00:01:02.350> use<00:01:02.790> unfortunately<00:01:03.790> they<00:01:03.970> do<00:01:04.030> not

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
I guess use unfortunately they do not

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.050 
I guess use unfortunately they do not
have<00:01:04.449> Nintendo<00:01:05.199> 64<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:05.980> you<00:01:06.040> would<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:06.850> to

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
have Nintendo 64 so you would have to

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.270 
have Nintendo 64 so you would have to
look<00:01:07.330> for<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.840> different<00:01:08.050> emulator<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.100> run

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
look for a different emulator to run

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.640 
look for a different emulator to run
that<00:01:09.460> but<00:01:10.240> other<00:01:10.480> than<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.930> have<00:01:11.200> game<00:01:11.409> why

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
that but other than that I have game why

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.980

a<00:03:10.320> wiimote<00:03:10.800> which<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.190> also<00:03:11.490> really<00:03:11.820> cool<00:03:12.120> I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
a wiimote which is also really cool I

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.690 
a wiimote which is also really cool I
mean<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.380> wiimotes<00:03:13.800> aren't<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.520> best

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
mean you know wiimotes aren't the best

at<00:03:15.060> playing<00:03:15.480> these<00:03:15.870> types<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.380> games<00:03:16.440> i<00:03:16.920> would

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
at playing these types of games i would

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.690 
at playing these types of games i would
suggest<00:03:17.820> rather<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.900> ps3<00:03:19.380> controllers<00:03:19.920> but

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
suggest rather the ps3 controllers but

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.370 
suggest rather the ps3 controllers but
you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.239> add<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> wiimote<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.110> that's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
you can add a wiimote and that's

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.530 
you can add a wiimote and that's
something<00:03:23.310> yeah<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:25.070> also

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
something yeah but you can do also

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.600 
something yeah but you can do also
here's<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> library<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.830> add<00:03:29.220> or

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
here's the library you can add or

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.120 
here's the library you can add or
subtract<00:03:30.390> any<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.050> consoles<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
subtract any of the consoles that you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.550 
subtract any of the consoles that you
want<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.670> use<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.110> where<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.440> can

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
want to use so this is where you can

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.690 
want to use so this is where you can
control<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:36.800> uninstalled<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:38.040> few<00:03:38.459> of

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
control that and uninstalled a few of

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.290 
control that and uninstalled a few of
the<00:03:39.260> consoles<00:03:40.260> because<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.970> wouldn't<00:03:41.970> use<00:03:42.120> them

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
the consoles because I wouldn't use them

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.340 
the consoles because I wouldn't use them
anyway<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.470> that's<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.110> if
