00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
install windows 7 even though I'm doing

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.770 
install windows 7 even though I'm doing
this<00:00:06.160> in<00:00:06.400> a<00:00:06.490> virtual<00:00:06.910> machine<00:00:07.000> that's<00:00:07.510> kind<00:00:07.750> of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:07.780 
this in a virtual machine that's kind of

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.780 
this in a virtual machine that's kind of
this<00:00:08.680> is<00:00:08.830> basically<00:00:09.190> how<00:00:09.280> it's<00:00:09.490> going<00:00:09.610> to<00:00:09.670> be

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
this is basically how it's going to be

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:23.070 
this is basically how it's going to be
in<00:00:09.850> a<00:00:09.940> regular<00:00:10.420> machine<00:00:10.809> so

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:41.280 

I<00:00:23.140> mean<00:00:23.730> install<00:00:24.730> is<00:00:25.060> pretty<00:00:25.480> fast

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
this virtual machine so it's going to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:02:10.100 
this virtual machine so it's going to
take<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> little<00:01:44.880> bit

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110

like like people have many different
hard<00:05:04.129> drives

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
hard drives

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.129 
hard drives
they<00:05:06.039> saw<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.490> in<00:05:06.699> different<00:05:06.819> drives<00:05:07.210> all

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
they saw it in different drives all

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.779 
they saw it in different drives all
right<00:05:08.289> I'm<00:05:08.500> gonna<00:05:08.590> come<00:05:08.889> back<00:05:08.919> with<00:05:09.069> a<00:05:09.250> part<00:05:09.550> 2

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
right I'm gonna come back with a part 2
