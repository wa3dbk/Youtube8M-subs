00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
in this video we're going to show you

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.220 
in this video we're going to show you
how<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.560> tie<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.000> FG<00:00:03.000> not<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.510> quickest<00:00:03.990> way

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
how to tie the FG not the quickest way

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.200 
how to tie the FG not the quickest way
possible<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:04.980> FG<00:00:05.339> not<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.700> it's<00:00:05.940> just<00:00:05.970> an

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
possible and this FG not is it's just an

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.210 
possible and this FG not is it's just an
awesome<00:00:06.450> nada<00:00:06.839> it's<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.200> must<00:00:07.470> know<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:08.010> those

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
awesome nada it's a must know for those

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.400 
awesome nada it's a must know for those
who<00:00:08.280> use<00:00:08.580> braids<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.660> reason<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:09.990> because<00:00:10.110> it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
who use braids the reason is because it

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
who use braids the reason is because it
is<00:00:10.530> incredibly<00:00:10.920> strong<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.849> actually<00:00:11.880> won<00:00:12.330> our

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
is incredibly strong it actually won our

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.419 
is incredibly strong it actually won our
strongest<00:00:13.139> knock<00:00:13.349> contest<00:00:13.860> for<00:00:14.099> going

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
strongest knock contest for going

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.269 
strongest knock contest for going
directly<00:00:15.179> from<00:00:15.269> braids<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> fluorocarbon

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
directly from braids to a fluorocarbon

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.070 
directly from braids to a fluorocarbon
leader<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.270> not<00:00:18.539> only<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.810> getting

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
leader but and not only is it getting

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.689 
leader but and not only is it getting
the<00:00:19.140> strongest<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.859> also<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> thinnest

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the strongest but it's also the thinnest

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.400 
the strongest but it's also the thinnest
as<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.020> completed

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
as you can see here this is a completed

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.679 
as you can see here this is a completed
knot<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.310> incredibly<00:00:23.939> thin<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> really

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
knot it is incredibly thin all it really

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.140 
knot it is incredibly thin all it really
is<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> braid<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:26.130> wrapped<00:00:26.519> around<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is is braid that's wrapped around a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.990 
is is braid that's wrapped around a
single<00:00:27.420> strand<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.710> leader<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.789> in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
single strand of your leader so that in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
single strand of your leader so that in
it<00:00:30.179> will<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.539> pull<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.230> there's<00:00:31.560> zero<00:00:32.009> way

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it will not pull off so there's zero way

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.459 
it will not pull off so there's zero way
that<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> could<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.850> any<00:00:33.090> skinnier<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.899> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that it could be any skinnier and this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
that it could be any skinnier and this
thing<00:00:34.680> will<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.010> fall<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.270> knot

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
thing will not fall this this this knot

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
thing will not fall this this this knot
here<00:00:36.719> will<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.930> fall<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> more<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:38.399> more

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
here will not fall the more with more

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
here will not fall the more with more
the<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.000> force<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.480> add<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the more force you add to it just the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.440 
the more force you add to it just the
stronger<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.579> stronger<00:00:41.879> than<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.149> become

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
stronger and is stronger than not become

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.180 
stronger and is stronger than not become
so<00:00:42.780> let's<00:00:43.290> go<00:00:43.379> ahead<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.710> started<00:00:43.829> we'll

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so let's go ahead and get started we'll

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160 
so let's go ahead and get started we'll
show<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> again<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> quickest<00:00:45.360> way<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
show you the again the quickest way to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
show you the again the quickest way to
tie<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> step<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.390> most

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
tie it so the step one the most

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
tie it so the step one the most
important<00:00:49.110> thing<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> way<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
important thing is to have have a way to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
important thing is to have have a way to
get<00:00:51.149> tension<00:00:51.539> onto<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:51.930> braid<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.680> what

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
get tension onto your braid because what

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.450 
get tension onto your braid because what
we're<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.219> we're<00:00:53.309> gonna<00:00:53.370> have

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
we're gonna do is we're gonna have

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.740 
we're gonna do is we're gonna have
tension<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.059> our<00:00:54.090> braid<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.660> we're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
tension on our braid and then we're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
tension on our braid and then we're
going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.500> essentially<00:00:55.920> wrap<00:00:56.190> we're

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
going to just essentially wrap we're

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
going to just essentially wrap we're
going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> thread<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.629> leader<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
going to thread the leader on to it and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to thread the leader on to it and
how<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.250> usually<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.640> tension<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> boat

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
how we usually get tension out in a boat

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990 
how we usually get tension out in a boat
is<00:01:00.690> I'll<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> tagging<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is I'll just this is the tagging of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
is I'll just this is the tagging of
course<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> line<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> goes<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
course and this is the line that goes to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
course and this is the line that goes to
the<00:01:04.559> rod<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.339> lean<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> rod<00:01:05.880> away

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the rod I would just lean the rod away

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
the rod I would just lean the rod away
from<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.990> way<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
from me that way that that just a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.429 
from me that way that that just a
gravity<00:01:08.310> forcing<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.909> rod<00:01:09.150> away<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.689> enough

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
gravity forcing that rod away is enough

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
gravity forcing that rod away is enough
is<00:01:10.590> enough<00:01:10.619> tension<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> tie<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> knot<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is enough tension to tie the knot so

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.030 
is enough tension to tie the knot so
right<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.150> actually<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.770> TV<00:01:13.770> remote

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
right now we actually have a TV remote

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560 
right now we actually have a TV remote
that's<00:01:14.460> tied<00:01:14.670> off<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> end<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.330> line

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that's tied off to the end of this line

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
that's tied off to the end of this line
so<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.439> ahead<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> move<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.009> off

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so I'm gonna go ahead and move it off

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890 
so I'm gonna go ahead and move it off
the<00:01:17.130> chair<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.939> attention<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.840> we

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the chair so we have attention so now we

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.999 
the chair so we have attention so now we
have<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.200> again<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.650> bit<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
have this again just a little bit of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
have this again just a little bit of
tension<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:21.080> necessary<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> tie<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
tension is necessary to tie this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.249 
tension is necessary to tie this
correctly<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.509> best<00:01:24.689> way<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
correctly and the best way to do it is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.740 
correctly and the best way to do it is
just<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> tag<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.460> mouth<00:01:26.750> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
just to put the tag in in your mouth so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.850 
just to put the tag in in your mouth so
the<00:01:27.869> tag<00:01:28.049> into<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> brain<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.740> your

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the tag into the brain goes in your

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
the tag into the brain goes in your
mouth<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.790> we're<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.030> I'll<00:01:30.210> show<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
mouth and then we're gonna I'll show you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
mouth and then we're gonna I'll show you
how<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> thread<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.740> leader<00:01:31.950> line<00:01:32.220> onto<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
how to thread the leader line onto the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
how to thread the leader line onto the
braid<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> strongest<00:01:34.170> not

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
braid so that you get the strongest not

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.940 
braid so that you get the strongest not
possible<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> first<00:01:36.900> step<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
possible so really the first step is to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
possible so really the first step is to
just<00:01:38.100> hover<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.090> line<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.810> hover<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
just hover the line over hover the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.039 
just hover the line over hover the
leader<00:01:40.650> over<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> line<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.659> away<00:01:42.990> from

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
leader over the line and going away from

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
leader over the line and going away from
you<00:01:43.380> first<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.979> towards<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> rod<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.090> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you first going towards the rod you just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.870 
you first going towards the rod you just
go<00:01:45.329> around<00:01:46.020> around<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> line<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.220> time<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
go around around the line one time and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850 
go around around the line one time and
pull<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> straight<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> same

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pull it straight and we do the same

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
pull it straight and we do the same
thing<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.909> towards<00:01:51.210> us<00:01:51.409> pull<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.439> straight

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
thing going towards us pull it straight

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.749 
thing going towards us pull it straight
another<00:01:53.880> towards<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.509> rod<00:01:54.689> straight<00:01:55.759> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
another towards the rod straight and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.539 
another towards the rod straight and
back<00:01:57.270> towards<00:01:57.600> us<00:01:57.689> straight<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
back towards us straight so that was a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
back towards us straight so that was a
total<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> four<00:02:00.090> times<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.570> did<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.930> did<00:02:01.079> one

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
total of four times we did we did one

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.190 
total of four times we did we did one
two<00:02:01.619> three<00:02:02.189> four<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.270> need<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> total

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
two three four so we need to do a total

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.639 
two three four so we need to do a total
of<00:02:04.290> 20<00:02:04.680> times<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.189> usually<00:02:05.670> use<00:02:05.790> 22<00:02:06.240> 22<00:02:06.689> wraps

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
of 20 times I usually use 22 22 wraps

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
of 20 times I usually use 22 22 wraps
that<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> make<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.429> knot<00:02:08.640> strongest<00:02:09.270> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that to make this knot strongest so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.760 
that to make this knot strongest so
we'll<00:02:09.750> go<00:02:09.869> ahead<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.440> those<00:02:10.590> right

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
we'll go ahead and just do those right

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.309 
we'll go ahead and just do those right
now

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
now

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.869 
now
and<00:02:11.409> every<00:02:11.829> time<00:02:11.980> -<00:02:12.219> you<00:02:12.370> always<00:02:12.519> want<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.790> make

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
and every time - you always want to make

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.690 
and every time - you always want to make
sure<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.180> pull<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.599> this<00:02:14.459> leader<00:02:15.459> line

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
sure that you pull this this leader line

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.759 
sure that you pull this this leader line
straight<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.450> way<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.870> these<00:02:17.019> these<00:02:17.379> loops

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
straight that way that these these loops

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.190 
straight that way that these these loops
these<00:02:18.040> coils<00:02:18.340> form<00:02:19.239> right<00:02:19.629> on<00:02:19.750> top<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.109> each

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
these coils form right on top of each

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160 
these coils form right on top of each
other<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.620> let's<00:02:21.579> go<00:02:21.700> ahead<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.969> do<00:02:22.090> 5<00:02:22.959> through

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
other so let's go ahead and do 5 through

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:45.559 
other so let's go ahead and do 5 through
20<00:02:25.650> alright<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.769> there's<00:02:26.920> 5<00:02:27.599> 6<00:02:30.510> 7<00:02:31.510> 8<00:02:39.599> 12<00:02:40.599> 13<00:02:43.260> 14

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
20 alright so there's 5 6 7 8 12 13 14

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:57.539 
20 alright so there's 5 6 7 8 12 13 14
15<00:02:46.680> 16<00:02:47.680> 17<00:02:51.569> 18<00:02:53.489> 19<00:02:56.340> 20

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
15 16 17 18 19 20

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.849 
15 16 17 18 19 20
all<00:02:58.419> right<00:02:58.569> there's<00:02:59.049> 20<00:02:59.379> as<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.680> see

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
all right there's 20 as you can see

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.339 
all right there's 20 as you can see
these<00:03:00.040> coils<00:03:00.370> are<00:03:00.609> alright<00:03:01.299> they're<00:03:01.480> bound<00:03:01.870> on

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
these coils are alright they're bound on

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.800 
these coils are alright they're bound on
top<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.829> one<00:03:02.950> another<00:03:03.329> so<00:03:04.329> now<00:03:04.450> we<00:03:04.540> need<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
top of one another so now we need to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.789 
top of one another so now we need to
lock<00:03:05.049> we<00:03:05.290> need<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.500> lock<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:05.950> place<00:03:07.799> so

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
lock we need to lock that in place so

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.110 
lock we need to lock that in place so
this<00:03:08.950> point<00:03:09.159> we<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.400> take<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.639> tension<00:03:09.849> off

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
this point we can take the tension off

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.240 
this point we can take the tension off
the<00:03:10.180> line<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:10.989> we're<00:03:11.079> gonna<00:03:11.139> do<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.349> 2<00:03:11.980> hitch

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
the line and so we're gonna do a 2 hitch

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.640 
the line and so we're gonna do a 2 hitch
knots<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.819> these<00:03:13.359> hitch<00:03:13.569> nuts<00:03:13.810> need<00:03:14.409> to<00:03:14.560> go

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
knots and these hitch nuts need to go

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.830 
knots and these hitch nuts need to go
around<00:03:14.950> both<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.250> braid<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.329> leader<00:03:16.540> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
around both the braid and the leader and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.259 
around both the braid and the leader and
all<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.949> really<00:03:18.099> just<00:03:18.340> do<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.729> loop

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
all it is is really just do it a loop

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.699 
all it is is really just do it a loop
and<00:03:19.479> go<00:03:19.690> through<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.079> loop<00:03:20.229> and<00:03:20.500> pull<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
and go through the loop and pull it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.280 
and go through the loop and pull it
tight<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.150> what<00:03:22.629> that's<00:03:22.750> going<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.049> that's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
tight and what that's going to do that's

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.830 
tight and what that's going to do that's
gonna<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:23.769> going<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:23.979> just<00:03:24.099> cinch<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.639> nut

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
gonna that's going to just cinch the nut

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.729 
gonna that's going to just cinch the nut
that's<00:03:25.840> going<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.079> hold<00:03:26.290> what<00:03:26.440> all<00:03:26.590> those

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
that's going to hold what all those

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.280 
that's going to hold what all those
coils<00:03:27.129> into<00:03:27.310> place<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.569> there's<00:03:28.750> one<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.139> that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
coils into place so there's one so that

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.780 
coils into place so there's one so that
we<00:03:29.409> can<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:29.680> take<00:03:29.769> our<00:03:30.280> finger<00:03:30.609> off<00:03:30.760> that

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
we can really take our finger off that

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.399 
we can really take our finger off that
because<00:03:31.180> these<00:03:31.329> these<00:03:31.629> coils<00:03:31.900> are<00:03:32.109> all<00:03:32.260> now

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
because these these coils are all now

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.770 
because these these coils are all now
bound<00:03:32.739> together<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.239> hitch<00:03:34.449> nut<00:03:34.659> so

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
bound together with that hitch nut so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
bound together with that hitch nut so
let's<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:35.019> one<00:03:35.229> more<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.859> ensure<00:03:36.729> that<00:03:36.970> we

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
let's do one more just to ensure that we

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.110 
let's do one more just to ensure that we
don't<00:03:37.239> lose<00:03:37.840> any<00:03:38.489> any<00:03:39.489> tension<00:03:39.849> there<00:03:39.970> when

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
don't lose any any tension there when

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.280 
don't lose any any tension there when
you<00:03:40.180> do<00:03:40.329> around<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.870> we're<00:03:40.989> getting<00:03:41.049> around

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
you do around it we're getting around

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.069 
you do around it we're getting around
both<00:03:41.909> let's<00:03:42.909> start<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.180> one<00:03:43.299> over<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.690> want<00:03:44.019> to

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
both let's start that one over I want to

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.210 
both let's start that one over I want to
make<00:03:44.169> sure<00:03:44.199> you're<00:03:44.530> able<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.709> see<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:44.979> so<00:03:45.129> we

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
make sure you're able to see that so we

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.559 
make sure you're able to see that so we
have<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.340> tagging<00:03:45.760> going<00:03:46.000> down<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.359> have<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
have the tagging going down we have the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.289 
have the tagging going down we have the
line<00:03:47.139> going<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.799> rod<00:03:47.979> as<00:03:48.310> well<00:03:49.030> as<00:03:49.150> the

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
line going out to the rod as well as the

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.899 
line going out to the rod as well as the
tag<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.370> fluorocarbon<00:03:51.370> going<00:03:51.729> up<00:03:51.849> to

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
tag in of the fluorocarbon going up to

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.580 
tag in of the fluorocarbon going up to
the<00:03:51.970> left<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:52.959> need<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.109> do<00:03:53.229> a<00:03:53.260> simple

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
the left so we just need to do a simple

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.809 
the left so we just need to do a simple
hitch<00:03:53.859> knot<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.340> again<00:03:54.519> we<00:03:54.609> just<00:03:54.729> do<00:03:54.879> a<00:03:54.959> loop<00:03:56.819> go

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
hitch knot so again we just do a loop go

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.179 
hitch knot so again we just do a loop go
through<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.329> loop<00:03:58.569> with<00:03:59.169> this<00:03:59.409> tag<00:03:59.709> end<00:03:59.949> of

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
through that loop with this tag end of

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.900 
through that loop with this tag end of
the<00:04:00.400> braid

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.520 

and<00:04:04.450> then<00:04:04.570> we<00:04:04.690> go<00:04:04.900> ahead<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.110> pull<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.380> tight

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
and then we go ahead and pull it tight

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and then we go ahead and pull it tight
you<00:04:05.560> can<00:04:05.740> see<00:04:05.860> we'll<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:06.130> pull<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
you can see we'll just pull it all the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.160 
you can see we'll just pull it all the
way<00:04:06.640> tight<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.210> get<00:04:07.420> all<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.690> way<00:04:07.780> down<00:04:07.930> to

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
way tight and get all the way down to

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.840 
way tight and get all the way down to
that<00:04:08.380> not<00:04:10.770> every<00:04:11.770> are<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:12.040> now<00:04:12.190> we<00:04:12.280> have<00:04:12.580> we

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
that not every are so now we have we

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.790 
that not every are so now we have we
have<00:04:13.030> our<00:04:13.060> loops<00:04:13.900> all<00:04:14.260> simps<00:04:14.680> they're

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
have our loops all simps they're

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.500 
have our loops all simps they're
together<00:04:14.950> at<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.850> point<00:04:16.090> we'll<00:04:16.270> go<00:04:16.360> ahead

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
together at this point we'll go ahead

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.360 
together at this point we'll go ahead
and<00:04:16.720> grab<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.200> two<00:04:17.380> main<00:04:17.590> lines<00:04:17.800> and<00:04:18.220> just

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
and grab the two main lines and just

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.060 
and grab the two main lines and just
pull<00:04:18.610> the<00:04:18.640> entire<00:04:19.060> thing<00:04:19.330> tight<00:04:19.950> let's<00:04:20.950> go

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
pull the entire thing tight let's go

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.860 
pull the entire thing tight let's go
ahead<00:04:21.130> pull<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.580> pull<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:22.060> there<00:04:22.240> tight<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:22.750> now

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
ahead pull it pull it there tight so now

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.380 
ahead pull it pull it there tight so now
we<00:04:22.990> can<00:04:23.230> clip<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.770> clip<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.640> the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
we can clip the clip the the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.990 
we can clip the clip the the
fluorocarbon<00:04:26.050> leader<00:04:26.140> off<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.700> at<00:04:27.880> this

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
fluorocarbon leader off and at this

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.580 
fluorocarbon leader off and at this
point<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.330> can<00:04:28.660> really<00:04:28.750> cut<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.110> this<00:04:29.230> just

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
point you can really cut to this just

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.050 
point you can really cut to this just
cut<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.860> as<00:04:29.950> close<00:04:30.160> as<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.400> possibly<00:04:30.820> can

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
cut it as close as you possibly can

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.330 
cut it as close as you possibly can
without<00:04:31.870> nicking<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.890> braid

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.770 

there<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.490> are<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.700> so<00:04:36.820> now<00:04:36.970> we<00:04:37.030> have<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.660> is

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
there you are and so now we have this is

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.870 
there you are and so now we have this is
this<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.110> really<00:04:38.350> it<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.550> make<00:04:39.700> this

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
this is really it and to to make this

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.390 
this is really it and to to make this
right<00:04:40.210> now<00:04:40.390> this<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.140> really<00:04:41.470> smooth<00:04:41.770> except

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
right now this is really smooth except

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.250 
right now this is really smooth except
there's<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:42.790> can<00:04:42.940> barely<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.750> tag<00:04:44.080> in

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
there's that you can barely the tag in

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.750 
there's that you can barely the tag in
will<00:04:44.410> barely<00:04:44.680> if<00:04:44.890> you<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.130> real<00:04:45.400> through<00:04:45.670> the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
will barely if you do real through the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.880 
will barely if you do real through the
rods<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.630> tag<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.080> will<00:04:47.260> could<00:04:47.620> could

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
rods this tag in will could could

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.770 
rods this tag in will could could
possibly<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.400> know<00:04:48.610> catch<00:04:49.090> on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> rod<00:04:49.510> tips

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
possibly you know catch on the rod tips

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.210 
possibly you know catch on the rod tips
just<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.290> barely<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.890> don't<00:04:50.980> have<00:04:51.070> to

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
just just barely this you don't have to

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.070 
just just barely this you don't have to
do<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:51.490> but<00:04:52.240> what<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.390> typically<00:04:52.690> do<00:04:52.840> is<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.020> do

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
do this but what I typically do is I do

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.320 
do this but what I typically do is I do
two<00:04:53.350> more<00:04:53.530> hitch<00:04:53.770> knots<00:04:54.010> just<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.940> make<00:04:55.120> sure

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
two more hitch knots just to make sure

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.900 
two more hitch knots just to make sure
that<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:55.840> tag<00:04:56.140> that<00:04:56.170> there's<00:04:56.560> no<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:57.070> guess

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
that that tag that there's no I guess

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.400 
that that tag that there's no I guess
there's<00:04:58.090> nothing<00:04:58.240> at<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.630> end<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.230> that

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
there's nothing at the end that that

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.720 
there's nothing at the end that that
that<00:04:59.980> can<00:05:00.160> catch<00:05:00.640> on<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.910> rod<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:03.580> do

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
that can catch on the rod so I just do

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.200 
that can catch on the rod so I just do
you<00:05:04.150> know<00:05:04.240> again<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.480> hitch<00:05:04.630> knot<00:05:04.840> there

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
you know again the hitch knot there

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.030 
you know again the hitch knot there
another<00:05:07.210> hitch<00:05:07.510> knot<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.800> so

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
another hitch knot and that is it so

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.800 
another hitch knot and that is it so
