00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:48.489 
sure that you have the open section of

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.479 
sure that you have the open section of
this<00:01:49.090> little<00:01:49.450> port<00:01:49.840> coming<00:01:50.500> right<00:01:50.860> into<00:01:51.250> there

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.489 
this little port coming right into there

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.699 
this little port coming right into there
and<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:52.000> goes<00:01:52.209> in<00:01:52.420> nicely<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.410> doesn't

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
and it goes in nicely and it doesn't

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.410 
and it goes in nicely and it doesn't
fall<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:53.890> easily<00:01:54.160> shake<00:01:54.849> it<00:01:54.940> shake<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.209> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
fall out easily shake it shake it the

reactor<00:01:55.810> blast<00:01:56.080> effect<00:01:56.379> is<00:01:56.500> attached<00:01:56.800> here

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
reactor blast effect is attached here

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.650 
reactor blast effect is attached here
very<00:01:57.220> nicely<00:01:57.399> -<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.030> can<00:01:58.119> get<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:58.360> pointing

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
very nicely - so you can get it pointing

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.999 
very nicely - so you can get it pointing
downward<00:01:58.989> shaking<00:01:59.319> it<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.530> it's<00:01:59.619> not<00:01:59.800> coming

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
downward shaking it and it's not coming

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.889 
downward shaking it and it's not coming
off<00:02:00.220> or<00:02:00.399> anything<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:01.119> way<00:02:01.239> you<00:02:01.300> just<00:02:01.390> attach

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
off or anything the way you just attach

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.630 
off or anything the way you just attach
this<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.410> there's<00:02:02.679> an<00:02:02.830> open<00:02:03.129> slot<00:02:03.280> right<00:02:03.580> there

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
this is there's an open slot right there

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.460 
this is there's an open slot right there
you<00:02:04.209> can<00:02:04.330> see<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.599> notch<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.170> then<00:02:05.259> there's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
you can see the notch and then there's

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.779 
you can see the notch and then there's
this<00:02:05.619> little<00:02:05.890> piece<00:02:06.099> sticking<00:02:06.220> down<00:02:06.550> from

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
this little piece sticking down from

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:07.889 
this little piece sticking down from
there<00:02:06.970> at<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.179> top<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.539> just<00:02:07.660> want<00:02:07.840> to

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
there at the top so you just want to

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.719 
there at the top so you just want to
make<00:02:07.989> sure<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.319> goes<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.310> lines<00:02:09.520> up

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
make sure that goes in and lines up

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.220 
make sure that goes in and lines up
correctly<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.209> then<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> stays<00:02:10.780> pretty<00:02:10.989> nice

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
correctly and then it stays pretty nice

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.869 
correctly and then it stays pretty nice
the<00:02:11.379> translucent<00:02:11.980> plastic<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.580> really

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
the translucent plastic just really

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.250 
the translucent plastic just really
works<00:02:13.150> for<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:13.480> thing<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
works for this thing and I like the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.479 
works for this thing and I like the
color<00:02:14.470> variation<00:02:15.010> how<00:02:15.099> we're<00:02:15.250> getting<00:02:15.340> a

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
color variation how we're getting a

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.890 
color variation how we're getting a
darker<00:02:15.879> orange<00:02:16.209> right<00:02:16.390> here<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
darker orange right here and it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.270 
darker orange right here and it
brightens<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:17.800> towards<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.160> end

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
brightens up as you get towards the end

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.890 
brightens up as you get towards the end
of<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.670> when<00:02:18.879> I<00:02:18.940> first<00:02:19.090> saw<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.480> effect<00:02:19.780> I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
of it now when I first saw this effect I

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.240 
of it now when I first saw this effect I
thought<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.230> was<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:20.830> his<00:02:21.010> self

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
thought this was like for his self

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.009 
thought this was like for his self
detonation<00:02:21.849> but<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.629> is<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.840> art

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
detonation but it's not this is the art

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.110 
detonation but it's not this is the art
blast<00:02:23.410> effect<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.890> he<00:02:23.980> does<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.430> mark<00:02:24.819> 5

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
blast effect that he does on that mark 5

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.030 
blast effect that he does on that mark 5
for<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.750> category<00:02:25.959> 5<00:02:26.379> guides<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.830> at<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
for that category 5 guides you at the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.470 
for that category 5 guides you at the
end<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> movie<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:27.730> he<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:27.970> blasts<00:02:28.239> like

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
end of the movie so he just blasts like

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.059 
end of the movie so he just blasts like
this<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.050> end<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> movie<00:02:29.560> when<00:02:29.769> he<00:02:29.800> self

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
this the end of the movie when he self

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.820 
this the end of the movie when he self
destructs<00:02:30.610> it's<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> huge

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
destructs it's like a huge

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.130 
destructs it's like a huge
Luling<00:02:32.700> supernova<00:02:33.390> kind<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.660> effect<00:02:33.960> that's

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
Luling supernova kind of effect that's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.930 
Luling supernova kind of effect that's
going<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.770> actually<00:02:35.070> explains<00:02:35.430> why<00:02:35.670> this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
going on that actually explains why this

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.730 
going on that actually explains why this
figure<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.600> dark<00:02:36.930> especially<00:02:37.350> compared<00:02:37.680> to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
figure is so dark especially compared to

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.140 
figure is so dark especially compared to
some<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.040> other<00:02:38.250> gipsy<00:02:38.610> danger<00:02:38.730> figures

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150

some of the other gipsy danger figures
we've<00:02:39.300> gotten<00:02:39.600> from<00:02:39.720> NECA

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
we've gotten from NECA

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.810 
we've gotten from NECA
because<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.710> takes<00:02:40.920> place<00:02:41.100> deep<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
because this takes place deep in the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.950 
because this takes place deep in the
ocean<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.240> everything<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:42.690> look<00:02:42.780> how<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
ocean and everything but look how the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.870 
ocean and everything but look how the
Battle<00:02:43.530> Damage<00:02:43.560> came<00:02:44.040> out<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.580> really

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
Battle Damage came out on this I really

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 
Battle Damage came out on this I really
like<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.300> lot<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.900> arm<00:02:46.290> right<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.800> looks

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
like it a lot this arm right here looks

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.010 
like it a lot this arm right here looks
very<00:02:47.400> similar<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.240> ha<00:02:48.450> shoe<00:02:48.720> which<00:02:48.870> one

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
very similar to the ha shoe which one

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.180 
very similar to the ha shoe which one
was<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> think<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.560> Battle<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.830> Anchorage

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
was I think the Battle of Anchorage

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.470 
was I think the Battle of Anchorage
version<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> one<00:02:50.940> where<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.210> missing

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
version was the one where it's missing

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.640 
version was the one where it's missing
the<00:02:51.570> arm<00:02:51.750> right<00:02:51.960> here<00:02:52.140> where<00:02:52.320> he<00:02:52.350> fought

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the arm right here where he fought

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530 
the arm right here where he fought
against<00:02:53.040> knife<00:02:53.250> head<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.360> arm

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
against knife head so it's this arm

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540 
against knife head so it's this arm
that's<00:02:54.780> gone<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.440> time<00:02:55.500> around<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.250> again

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
that's gone this time around and again

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.190 
that's gone this time around and again

there - so gypsy dangers articulation is
okay

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
okay

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.870 
okay
not<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.260> greatest<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.459> his<00:03:38.580> head<00:03:38.730> to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
not the greatest can get his head to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.490 
not the greatest can get his head to
turn<00:03:39.090> side<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.600> side<00:03:39.810> over<00:03:40.080> here<00:03:40.110> it's<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
turn side to side over here it's a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.570 
turn side to side over here it's a
little<00:03:40.680> tough<00:03:40.890> because<00:03:41.010> there's<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.340> lot<00:03:41.550> of

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
little tough because there's a lot of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.210 
little tough because there's a lot of
stuff<00:03:41.910> around<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:43.050> can<00:03:43.260> pinch<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.890> bottom<00:03:44.130> of

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
stuff around you can pinch the bottom of

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.070 
stuff around you can pinch the bottom of
the<00:03:44.280> chin<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.580> make<00:03:44.670> him<00:03:44.820> look<00:03:45.000> up<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.480> he<00:03:45.810> can

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
the chin and make him look up and he can

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.470 
the chin and make him look up and he can
look<00:03:46.350> down<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.950> as<00:03:47.130> well<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.730> not<00:03:47.880> too<00:03:48.209> much

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
look down here as well just not too much

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.540 
look down here as well just not too much
it's<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.019> tricky<00:03:49.410> his<00:03:50.010> shoulder<00:03:50.280> moves

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
it's kind of tricky his shoulder moves

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.699 
it's kind of tricky his shoulder moves
outward<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.989> much<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.500> can

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
outward just that much and you can

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.620 
outward just that much and you can
rotate<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.190> forward<00:03:53.430> he'd<00:03:53.700> bend<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.000> inward<00:03:54.360> -

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
rotate it forward he'd bend it inward -

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.810 
rotate it forward he'd bend it inward -
you<00:03:54.780> get<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> bicep<00:03:55.230> swivel<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:55.950> here<00:03:56.250> he<00:03:56.670> does

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you get a bicep swivel in here he does

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.550 
you get a bicep swivel in here he does
have<00:03:56.970> an<00:03:57.090> elbow<00:03:57.390> Bend<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.780> only<00:03:57.959> goes<00:03:58.260> that

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
have an elbow Bend that only goes that

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.830 
have an elbow Bend that only goes that
far<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.100> his<00:03:59.519> wrist<00:03:59.790> swivel<00:04:00.239> side<00:04:00.420> deciding

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
far and his wrist swivel side deciding

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.150 
far and his wrist swivel side deciding
could<00:04:00.989> get<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.260> wrist<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.560> bend<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.040> down

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
could get the wrist to bend up and down

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.740 
could get the wrist to bend up and down
a<00:04:02.190> little<00:04:02.340> bit<00:04:02.580> he<00:04:03.060> does<00:04:03.239> have<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.450> little<00:04:03.630> bit

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
a little bit he does have a little bit

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.780 
a little bit he does have a little bit
of<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.050> diaphragm<00:04:04.350> joint<00:04:04.860> over<00:04:05.100> here<00:04:05.340> that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
of a diaphragm joint over here that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.120 
of a diaphragm joint over here that
concerns<00:04:06.269> side<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.720> side<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.530> AB<00:04:07.680> section

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
concerns side to side so the AB section

concerns side to side so the AB section
on<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.400> figure<00:04:08.640> actually<00:04:08.820> does<00:04:09.150> not<00:04:09.300> move

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
on this figure actually does not move

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.360 
on this figure actually does not move
forward<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:09.989> back<00:04:10.200> at<00:04:10.470> all<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.190> actually

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
forward and back at all and I actually

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.580 
forward and back at all and I actually
did<00:04:11.910> break<00:04:12.269> this<00:04:12.480> figure<00:04:12.900> while<00:04:13.080> trying<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.410> do

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
did break this figure while trying to do

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.370 
did break this figure while trying to do
that<00:04:13.769> came<00:04:14.340> apart<00:04:14.610> right<00:04:14.850> over<00:04:15.120> here<00:04:15.360> but<00:04:16.200> as

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
that came apart right over here but as

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.900 
that came apart right over here but as
you<00:04:16.440> can<00:04:16.530> see<00:04:16.650> if<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:16.919> just<00:04:17.070> put<00:04:17.310> some<00:04:17.459> glue<00:04:17.700> in

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
you can see if you just put some glue in

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.300 
you can see if you just put some glue in
here<00:04:18.090> it'll<00:04:18.330> stay<00:04:18.630> together<00:04:19.140> again<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.010> it's

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
here it'll stay together again so it's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.030 
here it'll stay together again so it's
not<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.790> really<00:04:21.209> bad<00:04:21.510> break<00:04:21.840> but<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.890> did

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
not like a really bad break but it did

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.070 
not like a really bad break but it did
break<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.550> anyway<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.390> hips<00:04:24.660> can't<00:04:24.960> move

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
break so anyway the hips can't move

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.920 
break so anyway the hips can't move
outward<00:04:25.470> they<00:04:25.800> can<00:04:26.160> move<00:04:26.340> forward<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:27.540> do<00:04:27.720> get

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
outward they can move forward you do get

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.870 
outward they can move forward you do get
some<00:04:28.169> upper<00:04:28.470> thigh<00:04:28.650> swivel<00:04:29.130> right<00:04:29.340> over<00:04:29.580> here

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
some upper thigh swivel right over here

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.670 
some upper thigh swivel right over here
and<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.300> bends<00:04:30.510> very<00:04:30.810> far<00:04:31.110> at<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.350> knee<00:04:31.500> and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and it bends very far at the knee and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.710 
and it bends very far at the knee and
the<00:04:31.770> ankle<00:04:32.130> doesn't<00:04:32.940> really<00:04:33.090> move<00:04:33.240> down<00:04:33.450> so

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
the ankle doesn't really move down so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.450 
the ankle doesn't really move down so
much<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.229> can<00:04:34.590> move<00:04:34.710> up<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:34.950> little<00:04:35.130> bit<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.370> get

much it can move up a little bit you get

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.100 
much it can move up a little bit you get
that<00:04:35.610> toe<00:04:35.850> bend<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.360> he<00:04:36.419> does<00:04:36.630> have<00:04:36.810> some

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
that toe bend and he does have some

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.630 
that toe bend and he does have some
ankle<00:04:37.470> pivot<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.860> here<00:04:38.040> too<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.460> shoulder

reactor<00:04:57.560> blast<00:04:57.830> version<00:04:58.580> which<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.030> only

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
reactor blast version which is the only

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.660 
reactor blast version which is the only
one<00:04:59.540> that<00:04:59.600> does<00:04:59.930> not<00:04:59.960> have<00:05:00.290> a<00:05:00.650> diaphragm<00:05:01.070> join

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.650 
one that does not have a diaphragm join
all<00:05:01.850> these<00:05:01.940> other<00:05:02.090> ones<00:05:02.240> over<00:05:02.390> here<00:05:02.450> have

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
all these other ones over here have

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.300 
all these other ones over here have
diaphragm<00:05:03.110> joints<00:05:03.500> on<00:05:03.590> them<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:03.890> that's<00:05:04.100> how<00:05:04.280> I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
diaphragm joints on them so that's how I

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.010 
diaphragm joints on them so that's how I
broke<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.880> figure<00:05:05.210> thinking<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.750> can<00:05:05.900> get

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
broke the figure thinking that I can get

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.720 
broke the figure thinking that I can get
him<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.230> bend<00:05:06.410> forward<00:05:06.740> but<00:05:07.040> now<00:05:07.310> probably

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
him to bend forward but now probably

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.040 
him to bend forward but now probably
explains<00:05:08.120> why<00:05:08.210> he's<00:05:08.420> just<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.630> little<00:05:08.930> bit

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
explains why he's just a little bit

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.420 
explains why he's just a little bit
shorter<00:05:09.380> than<00:05:09.500> these<00:05:09.680> other<00:05:09.860> two<00:05:10.100> which<00:05:10.310> are

shorter than these other two which are
