00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so I'm just trying to let it be a little

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
so I'm just trying to let it be a little
bit<00:01:44.189> more<00:01:44.399> natural<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bit more natural and I actually think it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
looks slightly nicer I'm not making so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630 
looks slightly nicer I'm not making so
straight<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.290> yeah<00:01:49.470> I'm<00:01:49.680> still<00:01:49.920> using<00:01:50.340> my

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
straight so yeah I'm still using my
