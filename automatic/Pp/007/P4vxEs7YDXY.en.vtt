surrounding every single cell of our
body<00:00:02.730> we<00:00:03.090> have<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> special<00:00:03.870> membrane<00:00:04.290> a

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
body we have a special membrane a

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.460 
body we have a special membrane a
phospholipid<00:00:05.250> bilayer<00:00:06.060> membrane<00:00:06.629> known<00:00:06.870> as<00:00:06.930> a

phospholipid bilayer membrane known as a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.610 
phospholipid bilayer membrane known as a
semipermeable<00:00:08.069> membrane<00:00:08.960> so<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.469> that

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
semipermeable membrane so what that

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.129 
semipermeable membrane so what that
basically<00:00:10.920> means<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.480> allows<00:00:12.809> the

basically means is it allows the
movement<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.769> certain<00:00:14.250> molecules<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.210> the

movement of certain molecules but at the
same<00:00:15.509> time<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.139> prevents<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> movement<00:00:17.279> of

analogous<00:00:36.030> way<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.170> also<00:00:37.380> build<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
analogous way we can also build a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.940 
analogous way we can also build a
semipermeable<00:00:38.700> membrane<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.590> use

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
semipermeable membrane and we can use

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.090 
semipermeable membrane and we can use
the<00:00:41.550> semipermeable<00:00:42.540> membrane<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.469> process

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the semipermeable membrane in a process

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.420 
the semipermeable membrane in a process
known<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.750> dialysis<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.190> dialysis<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
known as dialysis so dialysis is a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
known as dialysis so dialysis is a
process<00:00:48.030> by<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.989> purify<00:00:49.350> proteins

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
process by which we can purify proteins

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.630 
process by which we can purify proteins
by<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.510> semipermeable<00:00:52.050> membrane<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
by using a semipermeable membrane so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330 
by using a semipermeable membrane so
let's<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.270> exactly<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.289> mean<00:00:55.500> by<00:00:55.710> taking

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
let's see exactly what we mean by taking

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
let's see exactly what we mean by taking
a<00:00:56.430> look<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> following<00:00:57.090> three<00:00:57.600> diagrams

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
a look at the following three diagrams

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.459 
a look at the following three diagrams
so<00:00:58.500> let's<00:00:58.980> begin<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.460> diagram<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.840> diagram

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so let's begin with diagram a in diagram

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.219 
so let's begin with diagram a in diagram
a<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.489> beaker<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> contains<00:01:03.239> pure

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a we have this beaker that contains pure

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.399 
a we have this beaker that contains pure
water<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.309> also<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> bag<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
water and we also have the bag now the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
water and we also have the bag now the
bag<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:08.010> enclosed<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.150> semipermeable

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
bag is enclosed in a semipermeable

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.910 
bag is enclosed in a semipermeable
membrane<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.700> these<00:01:11.909> tiny<00:01:12.330> pores

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
membrane so we have these tiny pores

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
membrane so we have these tiny pores
inside<00:01:13.920> our<00:01:14.310> bag<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.420> tiny<00:01:15.810> pores

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
inside our bag and these tiny pores

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.649 
inside our bag and these tiny pores
allow<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> movement<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:18.180> small

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
allow the movement of very small

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
allow the movement of very small
molecules<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.439> ions<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.310> prevent<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
molecules and ions but prevent the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
molecules and ions but prevent the
movement<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> large<00:01:21.900> molecules<00:01:22.290> such<00:01:22.950> as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
movement of large molecules such as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090 
movement of large molecules such as
protein<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.119> inside<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> bag<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.830> this

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
protein so inside the bag we have this

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.850 
protein so inside the bag we have this
solution<00:01:26.390> where<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.140> protein

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
solution where we have these protein

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.399 
solution where we have these protein
molecules<00:01:28.909> shown<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> purple<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:31.049> very

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
molecules shown in purple and these very

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.999 
molecules shown in purple and these very
tiny<00:01:31.770> molecules<00:01:32.520> shown<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.450> red<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
tiny molecules shown in red so the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.520 
tiny molecules shown in red so the
membrane<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.270> example<00:01:36.299> composed<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
membrane can be for example composed of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.490 
membrane can be for example composed of
cellulose<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.880> contains<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:40.049> tiny

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
cellulose and it contains very tiny

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.539 
cellulose and it contains very tiny
pores<00:01:41.090> now<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.750> happens<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pores now what happens if we take this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.090 
pores now what happens if we take this
bag<00:01:44.939> we're<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.659> call<00:01:45.899> our<00:01:46.079> dialysis<00:01:46.890> bag

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
bag we're going to call our dialysis bag

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.359 
bag we're going to call our dialysis bag
and<00:01:47.490> placed<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.899> our<00:01:49.110> solution<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:50.070> pure

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and placed it into our solution of pure

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.850 
and placed it into our solution of pure
water<00:01:50.700> well<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.630> instant<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.350> place<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
water well at the instant we place it

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.090 
water well at the instant we place it
inside<00:01:53.100> nothing<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.360> happen<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.860> will

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
inside nothing will happen but what will

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
inside nothing will happen but what will
happen<00:01:56.130> over<00:01:56.729> time<00:01:56.939> well<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.140> answer<00:01:58.530> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
happen over time well to answer this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.100 
happen over time well to answer this
question<00:01:58.920> we're<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> use<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.570> second

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
question we're going to use the second

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.620 
question we're going to use the second
law<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.320> thermodynamics<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> law<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.329> entropy

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
law of thermodynamics the law of entropy

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.020 
law of thermodynamics the law of entropy
so<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.860> second<00:02:05.369> law<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> thermodynamics

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so the second law of thermodynamics

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.070 
so the second law of thermodynamics
tells<00:02:06.689> us<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.170> when<00:02:07.890> given<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> chance<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
tells us that when given a chance to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.619 
tells us that when given a chance to
energy<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.410> die<00:02:10.679> Spurs<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.550> larger<00:02:12.120> volume

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
energy will die Spurs to larger volume

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.280 
energy will die Spurs to larger volume
of<00:02:12.720> space

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of space

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.210 
of space
so<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.189> means<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:14.909> if<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.780> have

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
so what that means is if we have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
so what that means is if we have
localized<00:02:17.220> energy<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.390> closed<00:02:19.079> in<00:02:19.470> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
very small localized region and then we

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.979 
very small localized region and then we
open<00:02:22.799> up<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.099> space<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:24.150> energy<00:02:24.780> will

open up the space that energy will

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.830 
open up the space that energy will
disperse<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.099> spread<00:02:26.610> out<00:02:26.879> throughout<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
entire region of space now because

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.350 
entire region of space now because
molecules<00:02:31.319> carry<00:02:32.069> energy<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.030> say<00:02:33.209> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
molecules carry energy we can say the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.710

same<00:02:33.629> thing<00:02:33.930> about<00:02:34.079> molecules<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:36.540> have

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
same thing about molecules if we have

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.349 
same thing about molecules if we have
molecules<00:02:37.470> localized<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> trapped<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.239> a

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
very small region of space and then we

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.740 
very small region of space and then we
open<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.260> volume<00:02:43.650> those<00:02:44.549> molecules<00:02:44.970> will

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
open up that volume those molecules will

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.349 
open up that volume those molecules will
begin<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.379> move<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.769> disperse<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.819> spread

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
what we see will happen is over time

these molecules carry energy in this

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.180 
these molecules carry energy in this
case<00:03:50.669> all<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.180> molecules<00:03:51.720> were<00:03:52.319> localized<00:03:52.919> in

case all the molecules were localized in

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.039 
case all the molecules were localized in
the<00:03:53.220> bag<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.239> energy<00:03:54.449> that<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
the bag so all the energy that the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.439 
the bag so all the energy that the
molecules<00:03:55.560> carry<00:03:55.829> was<00:03:56.340> localized<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.180> bag

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
molecules carry was localized in the bag

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.020 
molecules carry was localized in the bag
but<00:03:57.750> now<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.530> molecules<00:03:59.129> are<00:03:59.340> they<00:03:59.549> are<00:03:59.730> they

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
but now the molecules are they are they

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.869 
but now the molecules are they are they
Spurs<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:00.659> so<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.959> energy<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.680> also<00:04:02.220> they<00:04:02.579> are

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
Spurs and so the energy is also they are

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.809 
Spurs and so the energy is also they are
they<00:04:03.269> Spurs<00:04:03.629> throughout<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.560> larger<00:04:05.459> region

they Spurs throughout this larger region
of<00:04:05.940> space<00:04:06.319> now<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.829> protein<00:04:08.459> molecules<00:04:09.180> even

tiny<00:04:32.770> molecules<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.449> means<00:04:34.810> we're

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
tiny molecules and so this means we're

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.189 
tiny molecules and so this means we're
going<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.740> have<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.220> much<00:04:36.639> purer<00:04:37.120> sample<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.020> our

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
going to have a much purer sample of our

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.610 
going to have a much purer sample of our
protein<00:04:38.770> than<00:04:39.460> before<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:41.199> is<00:04:41.470> the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
protein than before so this is the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.610 
protein than before so this is the
process<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.400> dialysis<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.620> dialysis

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
process of dialysis and dialysis

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.100 
process of dialysis and dialysis
basically<00:04:45.190> allows<00:04:45.639> us<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.210> purify<00:04:46.419> a<00:04:47.050> protein

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
basically allows us to purify a protein

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.550 
basically allows us to purify a protein
mixture<00:04:48.009> that<00:04:48.250> contains<00:04:48.509> these<00:04:49.509> very<00:04:50.169> tiny

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
mixture that contains these very tiny

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.029 
mixture that contains these very tiny
nonce<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.580> non<00:04:52.000> protein<00:04:52.620> substances<00:04:53.620> for

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
nonce and non protein substances for

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.160 
nonce and non protein substances for
example<00:04:54.610> ions<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.389> other<00:04:55.750> tiny<00:04:56.229> molecules
