your win-loss ratio will always be high
but<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> hire<00:01:12.030> KD<00:01:12.420> ratio<00:01:12.750> which

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
but you want to hire KD ratio which

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
but you want to hire KD ratio which
means<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.530> don't<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.040> infected<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
means you don't want to be infected and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
means you don't want to be infected and
we'll<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> later<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.350> we're

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
we'll get to that later on but now we're

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.780 
we'll get to that later on but now we're
going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> check<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.070> stats<00:01:17.369> before<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
played this game and as you see my k/d

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
played this game and as you see my k/d
ratio<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.950> 1<00:01:20.220> point<00:01:20.430> 8<00:01:20.610> 11<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.689> win-loss

ratio is 1 point 2 74 that's not too bad

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
ratio is 1 point 2 74 that's not too bad
for<00:01:24.210> myself<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.840> many<00:01:25.049> people<00:01:25.140> wanted<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> see

big difference but there was a
difference<00:01:37.170> because<00:01:37.320> both<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.280> KD<00:01:38.549> ratio

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
difference because both of the KD ratio

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.899 
difference because both of the KD ratio
in<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.840> lip<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.590> win-loss<00:01:40.950> ratio<00:01:41.400> was

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
in my lip and my win-loss ratio was

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
in my lip and my win-loss ratio was
about<00:01:42.210> point<00:01:42.570> 3<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.049> point<00:01:43.409> four<00:01:43.649> times<00:01:43.979> higher

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
about point 3 or point four times higher

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
about point 3 or point four times higher
and<00:01:44.720> if<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> play<00:01:46.020> 20<00:01:46.530> 50<00:01:47.159> 30<00:01:47.430> 15<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.750> or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and if you play 20 50 30 15 or have or

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
however how many times you want to play
you<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.869> notice<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.380> big<00:01:52.560> difference<00:01:52.619> maybe

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you will notice a big difference maybe

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
you will notice a big difference maybe
ninety<00:01:53.729> percent<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.570> difference<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.170> your

an<00:01:58.049> i'm<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.350> showing<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> how<00:01:58.740> to

an i'm going to be showing you how to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
an i'm going to be showing you how to
get<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.130> k/d<00:01:59.399> ratio<00:01:59.549> hi<00:02:00.149> playing<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
get your k/d ratio hi playing this and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.690 
get your k/d ratio hi playing this and
as<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> whenever<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.159> join<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> game

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
as you see whenever you join a game

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.539 
as you see whenever you join a game
don't<00:02:02.969> join<00:02:03.210> straight<00:02:03.659> away<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
don't join straight away as you see just

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.010 
don't join straight away as you see just
wait<00:02:05.670> until<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> first<00:02:06.299> person<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.840> infected

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
wait until the first person is infected

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
wait until the first person is infected
then<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> choose<00:02:08.129> your<00:02:08.280> class<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> that's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
then you choose your class and that's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.540 
then you choose your class and that's
pretty<00:02:09.330> much<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> did<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.500> that's<00:02:11.370> an

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
pretty much what I did and that's an

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.940 
pretty much what I did and that's an
easy<00:02:11.760> way<00:02:12.090> how<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> knock<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.959> infected<00:02:13.410> first

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
easy way how to knock and infected first

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
easy way how to knock and infected first
usually<00:02:14.340> when<00:02:14.489> you're<00:02:14.610> infected<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.360> hard

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
usually when you're infected it's hard

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.809 
usually when you're infected it's hard
to<00:02:15.930> kill<00:02:16.200> people<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.680> you're<00:02:16.830> probably<00:02:17.040> your

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
to kill people and you're probably your

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.910 
to kill people and you're probably your
k/d<00:02:18.030> ratio<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:18.540> probably<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:19.019> down<00:02:19.050> so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
k/d ratio will probably go down so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.009 
k/d ratio will probably go down so
that's<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.280> quick<00:02:20.489> tip<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.180> actually<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.840> get

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
that's a quick tip to actually not get

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.850 
that's a quick tip to actually not get
infected<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:23.790> how<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.840> stay<00:02:25.739> alive

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
infected and actually how to stay alive

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
infected and actually how to stay alive
and<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.550> your<00:02:26.700> k/d<00:02:26.910> ratio<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.750> your

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
and get your k/d ratio up and your

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.930 
and get your k/d ratio up and your
win-loss<00:02:28.170> ratio<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.550> guys<00:02:29.700> have

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
win-loss ratio up so if you guys have

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.280
