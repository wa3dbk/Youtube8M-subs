00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.160
 if we are with ignacio scocco the 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.900
 good match scorer you see that 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.040
 follow the trend is little doing 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.040
 goals like in the last tournament 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.250
 we start well we have to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.990
 that the important thing is not that the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.789
 team won that is the fundamental thing I 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.109
 I always said that the first other 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.880
 good equipment operation so if 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.380
 I have to score better now than match 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.739
 change that the prison could have 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.360
 changed everything if it 's until the end was 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.460
 a match that was for any of 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.420
 both that will be a 1-0 match too 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.760
 and good luck we could 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.719
 put the second one and then increase the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.640
 difference so that the quieter 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.019
 they will fix them with the players 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.050
 they have to face all the 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.500
 competencies yes I think we have a 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.479
 campus of boy that of much that 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.670
 We have to like it, but they have a great 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.829
 future and we count on it because 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.989
 surely you do not need more in search 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.839
 of being a scorer again I imagine myself in 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.129
 seeks to repeat the past tournament and 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.750
 that the team can be the protagonist 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.950
 again 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.180
 and obviously we have the cup 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.710
 liberators that is very important for 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.710
 thank you 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.660
 to see I can judge with maxi rodrÃ­guez 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.820
 good maxi change in an instant the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.590
 match of the stages to lose and of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.100
 they suddenly ended up winning and so on 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.100
 driving the ball 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.140
 we put ourselves in advantage they do not make a goal 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.450
 out there with a fault our ball 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.610
 stop have the opportunity to get by 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.520
 front not 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.680
 We forcefully handle the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.120
 party and also manage the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.060
 independent body despair 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.720

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.770
