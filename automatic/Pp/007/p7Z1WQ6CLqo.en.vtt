if when I looked back at call of duty 4
ok<00:00:22.529> modern<00:00:23.189> warfare<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.750> jumped<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.990> modern

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
ok modern warfare and jumped to modern

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.580 
ok modern warfare and jumped to modern
warfare<00:00:25.410> 2<00:00:25.849> Wow<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.050> gotta<00:00:28.230> say<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
warfare 2 Wow one thing I gotta say is

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.200 
warfare 2 Wow one thing I gotta say is
the<00:00:28.710> graphics<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:30.109> dramatically<00:00:31.109> increased

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
the graphics have dramatically increased

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.280 
the graphics have dramatically increased
dramatically<00:00:33.210> increase<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.960> reason

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
dramatically increase the one reason

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.690 
dramatically increase the one reason
only<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.620> because<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.160> did<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.670> purpose

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
only is because they did this on purpose

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.100 
only is because they did this on purpose
because<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.600> knew<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.840> could<00:00:36.989> do

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
because they knew they could do

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
because they knew they could do
something<00:00:37.320> better<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.399> won<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> game<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.120> be

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
something better they won the game to be

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
something better they won the game to be
more<00:00:39.420> realistic<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> want

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
more realistic and this is what I want

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
more realistic and this is what I want
to<00:00:41.010> talk<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.280> today<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> multiplayer

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to talk about today is the multiplayer

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810 
to talk about today is the multiplayer
gameplay<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.170> let's<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.440> started<00:00:43.820> well

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
gameplay so let's get started well

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.310 
gameplay so let's get started well
basically<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> beginning<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
basically in the beginning of the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
basically in the beginning of the
multiplayer<00:00:46.739> gameplay<00:00:47.039> videos<00:00:47.489> I've<00:00:47.670> seen<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
multiplayer gameplay videos I've seen I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
multiplayer gameplay videos I've seen I
noticed<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:49.860> thing<00:00:50.219> only

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
noticed one thing and one thing only

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.170 
noticed one thing and one thing only
like<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.329> said<00:00:51.390> before<00:00:51.739> graphics<00:00:52.739> were<00:00:52.860> better

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
like I said before graphics were better

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.720 
like I said before graphics were better
colorization<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.660> better<00:00:55.100> even<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> physics

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
colorization was better even the physics

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
colorization was better even the physics
are<00:00:57.180> much<00:00:57.539> more<00:00:57.780> realistic<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
are much more realistic the way you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.610 
are much more realistic the way you
moved<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.579> ran<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.090> everything<00:01:00.500> now<00:01:01.500> in

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
moved when you ran and everything now in

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.740 
moved when you ran and everything now in
my<00:01:01.710> opinion<00:01:01.850> all<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.300> don't<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.629> if

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
my opinion all right I don't know if

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.899

it's your opinion also but to me when I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
it's your opinion also but to me when I
seen<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.360> video<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.640> best

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
seen this video this is the best

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.969

first-person shooter I've ever seen in
my<00:01:11.070> life<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.330> physics<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
my life the way the physics are the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
my life the way the physics are the
graphics<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> colorization<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:15.810> look

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
graphics and the colorization just look

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.280 
graphics and the colorization just look
the<00:01:16.290> best<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> guys<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.200> you
