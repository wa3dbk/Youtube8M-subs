00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 and this video is an offering psg 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.109
 collecting the children of the best 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 Quality and the best price in Brazil 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.429
 check out the link in the leo description won 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 well what character of gold does that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.690
 You really want to know about your 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 past and its history showing how 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.390
 he became what he is today 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 I have three characters the first one is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.400
 Obviously it 's the streetcar everyone roger 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.009
 he wants to know what his past is like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.890
 became pirate rivers the second is the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.899
 monkey call because we see that until 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 so the new species was released with a 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.730
 had a little ball playing in the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.430
 terminal goes there the other gray tone 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 neighbor that the soap on the wi-fi wire 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.739
 They defeated and are Navy Hero 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 and the third is the good dragon that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 became a revolutionary navy son 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.940
 what is his past if he was a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.789
 pirate or if he was a sailor what 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 made him want to be a revolutionary 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 are these things that I would like to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 be shown faster 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.670
 if possible but I do not think so. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.159
 will it be so fast sayuri skin you think 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 that when the government was rotten 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.740
 revealed to the world and this culminates in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 so spoken final war promised by the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.900
 other chic local pirates still 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.770
 will vote on the side of government or will 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.689
 to reveal 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 I believe it will depend on the will 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.100
 of each 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.590
 Good hancock, we sure are. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 absolute will be in favor of the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.329
 dolphin we know that some others 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.890
 pirates also tends to be 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.290
 in favor of the gulf but will depend 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.659
 the will of each and also defended 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.270
 the most advantageous trust for them and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.159
 still ignore this power of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 government by force if we are also 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.229
 pirate that alone can or that thing 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.579
 Same guy, we do not want to leave anymore. 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.500
 now we can not 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.240
 also the race a new one with everything 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.219
 and not be who we are I believe 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.870
 will depend very much on the will of each 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.480
 so the soul 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.580
 the good cockpit will reveal itself now to the others 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.220
 Can not say one right yet is that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.500
 miner if a person gets the fruit of the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.200
 giant as well as changing its size 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.300
 she also had a half -life expectancy of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 a giant I think not I think 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.750
 she only has the powers because 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.480
 it would not make sense to me 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.550
 life expectancy of a giant and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 same thing that I know there with the framework that 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.660
 ate the fruit in front of me 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.400
 life expectancy of a party or or 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.530
 I do not know any other because the future 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.240
 did not enter because it is an arena with 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.250
 life expectancy of a man does not 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.320
 I do not see that sense, I think that winning 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.850
 only the central power and even if it 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.980
 to gain the life expectancy of a 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.170
 Chinese giant is boring would be the same 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 type of perspective of the group that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.380
 kind of thing you see your 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.630
 fellows moment and you continue 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.160
 I live there with those powers and the life 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.350
 begins to make us feel 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.060
 a time that the person would lose sense and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.980
 what will he break all then not 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 I think we can only get even more 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.960
 cool guilherme 1 and we know that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.090
 the disease shop and was crucial for the 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.220
 history on the block the development of 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.709
 new there is some other character and 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.300
 because at some point in the manga I 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.190
 I know you sat down to stay. 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.989
 guillaume or exile plus this more 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.780
 Funny, it's not that thing like that 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.880
 I want it to look looks but I think 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 by the character's story 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.590
 I know who he is and he would have 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.950
 that having a death on his level would be a 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.920
 garp blow to believe it would be very 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.360
 cool if he died defending come 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.010
 protecting the film that does not make sense 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.630
 to protect facing but still the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.280
 since then it has made a lot of sense 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.950
 but I have not lived that something like the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.810
 and if it was my brother died and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.030
 protecting my grandfather now died and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.280
 protecting culture would go crazy and 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.650
 it's not that kind of crazy scream 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.690
 I'm just as shocked as you just met. 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 the club did much the same as the bitch with the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.410
 normal dog everyone stays in that 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.330
 but now with the level of 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.880
 mentality that I think he is and 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.250
 I'd go crazy with fury not crazy about 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.170
 lost but soon of fury and when he 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.190
 with the whey, it's enough that he was 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.620
 hungry is in the Senate and was up 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.790
 I think in that other scene too 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.800
 What he does is when he is 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.840
 attacking the union nor the idea for 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.880
 his dwelling with the triangle hypnotized and 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.380
 there it is local and only then does it see that 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.540
 I did have this scene so I guess 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.670
 I would be furious and wanted to leave 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.310
 and everybody then I do not know 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.390
 I think it would be interesting for history 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.400
 place with die 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.720
 it would be sad really sad i like 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.280
 playing here would not be interesting 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.160
 For the story, a boy died of a 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.980
 epic form played to protect fernando 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.030
 rodrigues made up of NGOs that you most 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.370
 liked 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.770
 Had one that happened in the ufs ex I liked it 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.780
 much by the cosplay but by the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.940
 photo composition that does not 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.280
 how come man I did not think I was with 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.290
 waistcoat did not stay she did not need 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.700
 show the type so our time my 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.940
 breasts on my ass like I'm hot 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.060
 I cosplay sucks but she did not 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.700
 character was left out of the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.440
 photo composition was out think 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.750
 that's what made your best 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.150
 of the economy in which I have already seen 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.130
 today lucas da silva passion you already 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.410
 thought of some time in his life if 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.650
 wanted to be the manga or even a 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.180
 editor since there are already six but I think 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.970
 that I have no way you'd need 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.250
 study the history of recognizing 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.919
 some things of history not only from your 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.010
 country but did not invent world history 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.560
 and I do not know if I could give myself 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.330
 well I think I could not 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.220
 to face the goal was sent away 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.050
 because everyone who comes with an idea 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.330
 cool even sent me a message on 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.490
 page office crimes in a cage and 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.380
 paula told me to turn it on. 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.640
 take a look and if good story 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.980
 share it 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.450
 the initiative of the guy to make pay 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.830
 especially in Brazil is not all 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.390
 world that has this ability so 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.800
 still has this retrograde mentality of 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.630
 looking for his tenure in which the 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.610
 Now it's time to make a contest. 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.070
 to search the entire world and 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.840
 it's not that but I think every idea 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.850
 should be projected forward but 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.700
 Unfortunately, I'm the best to talk. 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.650
 shit does not 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.660
 do things out delivered by the channel 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.130
 now and that's it, I guess I do not 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.710
 I could live as editor of 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.420
 to command coffee plantations to want to find 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.250
 that's a cool thing is one thing 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.080
 interesting but you have to have the 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.310
 story or the first thing you 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.190
 have to have when you are going to make a 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.310
 story is how you're going to start 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.830
 And how will you finish the rest of you? 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.030
 develops it 's not yours I can not get 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.620
 these two points I think that's why 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.080
 even if I could, I do not know 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.470
 draw are also at ease people 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.060
 It has but lack technical and missing 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.800
 composition of the story is missing many 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.350
 other things just will not think 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.720
 you can support a family, right? 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.480
