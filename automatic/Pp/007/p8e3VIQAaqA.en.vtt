this<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.380> how<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.529> like<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.890> start<00:00:05.220> an<00:00:05.339> image

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
this is how I like to start an image

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.970 
this is how I like to start an image
from<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.270> blank<00:00:06.480> canvas<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.200> need<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.710> start

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
from a blank canvas I need to start

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.490 
from a blank canvas I need to start
thinking<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.730> general<00:00:09.150> idea<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.139> POV

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.860 
thinking about a general idea and a POV
for<00:00:10.920> my<00:00:11.070> shot<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.759> general<00:00:12.090> idea<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.660> create

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870

for my shot my general idea is to create
a<00:00:13.230> landscape<00:00:13.769> within<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.700> medieval<00:00:15.150> culture

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
a landscape within a medieval culture

a landscape within a medieval culture
within<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.410> medieval<00:00:16.830> design<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.430> show<00:00:18.060> some

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
within a medieval design and show some

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390 
within a medieval design and show some
sort<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> narrative<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.949> intrigue<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sort of narrative that can intrigue the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
sort of narrative that can intrigue the
viewer<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.330> them<00:00:21.510> feel<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:21.810> they're<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
viewer and have them feel like they're a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220 
viewer and have them feel like they're a
part<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> action<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.420> I<00:00:24.420> start<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
part of the action as I start I like to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320 
part of the action as I start I like to
put<00:00:25.410> down<00:00:25.590> broad<00:00:25.949> strokes<00:00:26.430> getting<00:00:27.240> the

put down broad strokes getting the

create a good tonality and a sense of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.130 
create a good tonality and a sense of
lighting<00:00:32.239> now<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.510> thinking<00:00:33.630> about

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
lighting now I'm really thinking about

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.979 
lighting now I'm really thinking about
how<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> create<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> good<00:00:35.250> composition<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
how to create a good composition here to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.569 
how to create a good composition here to
get<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> eye<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.469> travel<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
get the eye to travel from the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.440 
get the eye to travel from the
foreground<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.809> way<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> background

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.139 

putting<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.570> certain<00:00:45.870> design<00:00:46.170> elements<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
putting in certain design elements of

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.029 
putting in certain design elements of
squared-off<00:00:48.149> shapes<00:00:48.629> versus<00:00:49.320> rounded<00:00:49.770> shapes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
squared-off shapes versus rounded shapes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
squared-off shapes versus rounded shapes
allows<00:00:50.820> me<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> control<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.899> viewer<00:00:52.289> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
allows me to control how the viewer can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
allows me to control how the viewer can
understand<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.460> elements<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.120> trying<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
understand what elements I'm trying to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
understand what elements I'm trying to
design<00:00:55.070> having<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> foreground<00:00:56.550> elements

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
design having the foreground elements

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
design having the foreground elements
being<00:00:57.390> carved<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.469> marble<00:00:59.219> stone

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
being carved out like marble stone

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
being carved out like marble stone
rounded<00:01:00.329> off<00:01:00.420> rocks<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> different<00:01:01.890> elements

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
rounded off rocks and different elements

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.729 
rounded off rocks and different elements
will<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.030> allow<00:01:03.149> me<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> create<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.320> unique

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
will really allow me to create a unique

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
will really allow me to create a unique
visual<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.549> feels<00:01:05.850> relatable<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.750> things

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
visual that feels relatable to things

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.380 
visual that feels relatable to things
that<00:01:07.110> we've<00:01:07.320> seen<00:01:07.470> before

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.179 

now<00:01:12.390> lighting<00:01:12.810> becomes<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.680> essential

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
now lighting becomes very very essential

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
now lighting becomes very very essential
and<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.729> certain<00:01:15.030> value<00:01:15.210> structure<00:01:15.630> was

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
and a certain value structure was

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.780 
and a certain value structure was
created<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.430> sure<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
created so I need to make sure that I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.240 
created so I need to make sure that I
follow<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> same<00:01:18.659> sensibilities<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.650> use

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
follow the same sensibilities and use

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
follow the same sensibilities and use
the<00:01:20.369> same<00:01:20.580> type<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> lighting<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the same type of lighting in the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.120 
the same type of lighting in the
foreground<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.830> background

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.039 

and<00:01:28.130> over<00:01:28.369> here<00:01:28.670> I'm<00:01:28.850> thinking<00:01:29.000> about<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:29.810> a

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
and over here I'm thinking about just a

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.350 
and over here I'm thinking about just a
few<00:01:30.530> other<00:01:30.799> elements<00:01:31.400> to<00:01:31.520> be<00:01:31.640> repeated<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:32.330> the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
few other elements to be repeated in the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.990 
few other elements to be repeated in the
background<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.409> that<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.680> feels<00:01:33.890> large<00:01:34.640> and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
background so that it feels large and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.180 
background so that it feels large and
epic<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.630> really<00:01:36.080> create<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.500> sensibility

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
epic and really create the sensibility

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.120 
epic and really create the sensibility
of<00:01:37.220> space<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.790> I'm<00:01:37.909> trying<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.210> go<00:01:38.330> for<00:01:39.130> now

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
of space that I'm trying to go for now

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.249 
of space that I'm trying to go for now
this<00:01:40.310> wall<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.210> foreground<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.869> very

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
this wall in the foreground is very

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.140 
this wall in the foreground is very
important<00:01:42.800> for<00:01:42.950> me<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.070> establish<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.820> certain

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
important for me to establish a certain

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.420 
important for me to establish a certain
sense<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.600> scale<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.409> wall<00:01:45.619> becomes<00:01:46.009> about

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
sense of scale the wall becomes about

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.090 
sense of scale the wall becomes about
waist<00:01:46.759> height<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:47.750> now<00:01:47.930> we<00:01:47.990> understand<00:01:48.560> how

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
waist height so now we understand how

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.670 
waist height so now we understand how
large<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:50.060> space<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:50.540> be<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.050> when<00:01:51.409> we<00:01:51.440> see

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
large this space can be and when we see

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.320 
large this space can be and when we see
the<00:01:51.800> repeated<00:01:52.250> elements<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.880> background

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
the repeated elements in the background

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.940 
the repeated elements in the background
it<00:01:53.509> gives<00:01:53.570> us<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> perfect<00:01:54.200> sense<00:01:54.710> of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
it gives us a perfect sense of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.230 
it gives us a perfect sense of
understanding<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:56.000> space<00:01:57.970> these<00:01:58.970> little

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
understanding the space these little

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.050 
understanding the space these little
details<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.869> cracks<00:02:00.229> other<00:02:01.190> elements<00:02:01.880> within

details of cracks other elements within
the<00:02:02.240> architecture<00:02:02.509> are<00:02:03.050> very<00:02:03.380> secondary<00:02:04.070> to

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
the architecture are very secondary to

the architecture are very secondary to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
beginning is my main focus now back here

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.170 
beginning is my main focus now back here
in<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.709> background<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.790> some<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:14.090> these

really<00:02:16.640> add<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.150> scale<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.750> add<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.410> the

really add to the scale and add to the
design<00:02:18.680> which<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.760> now<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:19.970> second<00:02:20.510> focus

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
design which is now the second focus

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.590 
design which is now the second focus
that<00:02:21.350> I'm<00:02:21.500> working<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:22.239> these<00:02:23.239> design

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
that I'm working on these design

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.420 
that I'm working on these design
elements<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.769> create<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
elements that I like to create on the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.250 
elements that I like to create on the
architecture<00:02:26.090> will<00:02:26.569> allow<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.080> feel

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
architecture will allow it to feel

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
architecture will allow it to feel
cultural<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.489> more<00:02:28.700> repeated<00:02:29.120> shapes

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
cultural and the more repeated shapes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
cultural and the more repeated shapes
that<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.569> can<00:02:29.750> create<00:02:29.989> will<00:02:30.620> make<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:30.860> all<00:02:31.040> feel

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that I can create will make it all feel

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.569 
that I can create will make it all feel
tied<00:02:31.549> together<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.239> one<00:02:33.110> king<00:02:33.500> or<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.160> ruler

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
tied together like one king or one ruler

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.880 
tied together like one king or one ruler
made<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.360> happen

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.220 

the<00:02:40.790> design<00:02:41.120> cues<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.420> I'm<00:02:41.630> thinking<00:02:41.960> about

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
the design cues that I'm thinking about

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.350 
the design cues that I'm thinking about
become<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.190> bit<00:02:43.370> more<00:02:43.430> rounded<00:02:44.210> off

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
become a little bit more rounded off

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.870 
become a little bit more rounded off
circular<00:02:45.290> shapes<00:02:45.590> mixed<00:02:45.980> with<00:02:46.070> triangles<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
circular shapes mixed with triangles and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.390 
circular shapes mixed with triangles and
again<00:02:47.450> these<00:02:47.660> basic<00:02:48.290> shapes<00:02:48.320> become<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
again these basic shapes become the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.610 
again these basic shapes become the
cornerstone<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:50.240> creating<00:02:50.750> any<00:02:50.990> solid

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
cornerstone of creating any solid

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.460 
cornerstone of creating any solid
environment<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:56.540> thinking<00:02:57.230> about<00:02:57.440> a

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
environment I'm thinking about a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.220 
environment I'm thinking about a
narrative<00:02:57.830> here<00:02:58.280> thinking<00:02:59.060> about<00:02:59.120> how<00:02:59.930> can<00:02:59.990> I

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
narrative here thinking about how can I

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.410 
narrative here thinking about how can I
show<00:03:00.470> some<00:03:00.770> activity<00:03:01.090> showing<00:03:02.090> people

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
show some activity showing people

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.240 
show some activity showing people
interacting<00:03:03.170> with<00:03:03.290> each<00:03:03.320> other<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.890> doing

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
interacting with each other and doing

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.490 
interacting with each other and doing
one<00:03:04.550> singular<00:03:05.270> action<00:03:05.720> they're<00:03:06.140> parading

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
one singular action they're parading

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.140 
one singular action they're parading
through<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.010> street<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.490> creating<00:03:08.000> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
through the street and creating a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.910 
through the street and creating a
narrative<00:03:08.660> for<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:08.959> viewer<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> actually

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
narrative for the viewer to actually

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.500 
narrative for the viewer to actually
relate<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.430> because<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.090> something<00:03:11.270> they've

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
relate to because it's something they've

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.300 
relate to because it's something they've
seen<00:03:11.750> before<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.380> many<00:03:12.920> many<00:03:13.190> different<00:03:13.550> ways

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.680 

now<00:03:19.310> I'm<00:03:19.400> thinking<00:03:19.670> about<00:03:19.730> costumes<00:03:20.390> I'm

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
now I'm thinking about costumes I'm

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.440 
now I'm thinking about costumes I'm
thinking<00:03:21.440> about<00:03:21.530> architectural<00:03:22.280> details<00:03:23.120> and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
thinking about architectural details and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.449 
thinking about architectural details and
I'm<00:03:23.870> also<00:03:24.020> thinking<00:03:24.290> about<00:03:24.590> tying<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:25.280> these

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
I'm also thinking about tying in these

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.820 
I'm also thinking about tying in these
shapes<00:03:25.730> in<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.570> way<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.900> becomes<00:03:27.200> relatable

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
shapes in a way that becomes relatable

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.850 
shapes in a way that becomes relatable
and<00:03:27.980> understandable<00:03:29.620> now<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.680> overall

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
and understandable now the overall

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.280 
and understandable now the overall
sensibility<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.910> piece<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.480> starting<00:03:33.200> to

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
sensibility of the piece is starting to

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.160 
sensibility of the piece is starting to
come<00:03:33.470> into<00:03:33.620> place<00:03:33.890> very<00:03:33.920> very<00:03:34.310> well<00:03:34.760> now<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.209> was

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
come into place very very well now I was

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.380 
come into place very very well now I was
mainly<00:03:36.709> focusing<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.340> trying<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.090> create<00:03:38.360> a

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
mainly focusing on trying to create a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.750 
mainly focusing on trying to create a
really<00:03:38.810> interesting<00:03:38.840> image<00:03:39.530> not<00:03:40.310> only<00:03:40.640> with

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
really interesting image not only with

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.820 
really interesting image not only with
man-made<00:03:41.209> shapes<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:42.050> with<00:03:42.200> an<00:03:42.290> interesting

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
man-made shapes but with an interesting

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.949 
man-made shapes but with an interesting
landscape<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.580> focused<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.690> good

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
landscape I focused on a good

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.470 
landscape I focused on a good
architectural<00:03:45.799> design<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.760> also<00:03:47.030> showed<00:03:47.450> a

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
architectural design that also showed a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.789 
architectural design that also showed a
good<00:03:47.780> break<00:03:47.989> down<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> foreground

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
good break down a foreground

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.440 
good break down a foreground
middle-ground<00:03:49.160> background<00:03:49.790> which<00:03:50.299> is

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
middle-ground background which is

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.210 
middle-ground background which is
important<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:50.900> any<00:03:51.170> viewer<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.769> understand

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
important for any viewer to understand

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.380 
important for any viewer to understand
what<00:03:52.340> kind<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.519> space<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.940> was<00:03:53.090> trying<00:03:53.330> to

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
what kind of space I was trying to

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.479 
what kind of space I was trying to
design<00:03:53.720> now<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.739> it's<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.160> put<00:03:55.370> together

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
design now that it's all put together

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.090 
design now that it's all put together
with<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.510> good<00:03:56.720> understanding<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.799> shapes

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
with the good understanding of shapes

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
with a good understanding of layout it's

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
all come together with an effective

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.210 
all come together with an effective
