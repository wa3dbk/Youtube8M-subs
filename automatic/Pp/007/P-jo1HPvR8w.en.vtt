00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
examine the effects of the drug not only

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.150

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
but look at this balance between risk

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.890 
but look at this balance between risk
and<00:04:24.650> benefits<00:04:25.100> in<00:04:25.340> terms<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:26.030> absolute
