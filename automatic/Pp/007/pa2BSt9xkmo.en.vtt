00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Today I 'm going to invite. I invited to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.500
 here a very dear person to me and is 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.559
 this person she is in my opinion a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 of the biggest voices I've ever heard sing 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 sings in my band we have our 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.609
 very good band by the way, right? 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 with 11 elements are nine musicians and 2 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.910
 two backing vocals is one of the backing 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 few she has her band today 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.800
 singing at parties wedding shows 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.970
 things and a person who has this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 So great a tone, you can not have a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 success and that the equivalent of this 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.559
 talent 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.559
 vanessa carla rocks 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.210

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:09.860
 achim which is a rolê 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.850

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:25.700
 am i 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:43.209
 but she died this year and over 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.680
 zé it but that is its equivalent in 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.760
 most famous male voice was 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.769
 Wonderful 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.480
 Know yourself better, talk to me, I'm 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.170

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.730
 fan 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.010
 We sing together, we 're there. 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.269
 four years already, I do not think we do 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.250
 some shows out there of course I do not 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.920
 I have this demand from you but we 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.459
 make a show so far, pretty cool, right? 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.079
 and she is beque in focus and have her band 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.209
 Do you have a band that you sing what? 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.640
 What do you do in your band is the dance theme? 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.840
 worked recording doing it again in 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.870
 Easter whelps but never exploded on the a5 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.150
 the compatibility of your talent 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.639
 the size of your voice is every time if you 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.650
 to analyze it has always been a means 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.080
 unfair women 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.760
 if you analyze well if you are 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.010
 buy this year had less space 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.500
 always, too well, well, not much space, you 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.169
 with in 28 21 years of career 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.229
 in these 21 years of continuous career 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.289
 being the same divas of 21 years ago 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.000
 grandmother would like 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.820
 We then succeeded Claudia 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.860
 leitte claudia leitte good the idea is this 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.500
 I 'm not talking to 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.300
 fernandão if you go there are few 14 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.680
 men who did for a little what I 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.770
 I just think that any 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.860
 talent she did not get rich is not that 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.990
 but I think the way to follow which 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.300
 to follow first she sang the 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.660
 played by the selection of the 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.910
 world shows and line in las vegas 8 to 0 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.820
 I think she's singing even has 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.560
 some parts that it surpasses the series of 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.130
 rasseli I told you I want to 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.289
 amuse 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.220
 Now Mr. Josef I already said that 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.380
 in society 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.419
 the only thing I would recommend 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.910
 her if she finds out its own 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:31.210
 has called her identity 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.370
 singing songs or made by her or with 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.139
 partners to develop a work from 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.320
 vanessa tell me what's missing 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.330
 for you 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.740
 I do not stay behind the fame actually for 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.620
 behind the success that I think is you 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.780
 see to do what you like well I already 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.120
 I walked a path that I live alone. 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.890
 singing but I did not even come close to 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.720
 I still want to live well and also 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.250
 do not sing yet but I like 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.690
 my goal is to sing what I like 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.390
 live well singing that I like you 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.400
 said to be true to my language and live 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.320
 With that, now I'm very much for you. 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.300
 Congratulations, look today you had a 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.100
 baptism in front of these guys 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.240
 I think they stayed and did not believe 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.950
 very impressed with brazil 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.190
 The whole thing was thank you for your 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.190
 presence 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.420
 This was our face and I think I 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.190
 I did not do ugly I did not exaggerate when 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.350
 i spoke pro cast us to big jerome 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.240
 musical talent of unimed bosnia 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.310
 it really is unjustifiable unfair 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.200
 person as she also knows the night of 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.310
 today they help marathon who knows her 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.310
 when he quotes for someone
