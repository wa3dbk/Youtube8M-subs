secure lock on the shaft now as far as

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
secure lock on the shaft now as far as
the<00:00:24.869> construction<00:00:25.109> goes<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> true

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the construction goes this is a true

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.310 
the construction goes this is a true
one-piece<00:00:26.880> using<00:00:27.330> their<00:00:27.449> premier<00:00:27.900> carbon

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

one-piece using their premier carbon
fiber<00:00:28.529> composite<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.910> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> see

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
fiber composite as you can kind of see

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
fiber composite as you can kind of see
it<00:00:30.449> shine<00:00:30.720> through<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.320> paint<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.740> top<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it shine through the paint up top this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.410 
it shine through the paint up top this
is<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.910> their<00:00:33.059> most<00:00:33.239> consistent

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
is going to be their most consistent

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.520 
is going to be their most consistent
most<00:00:34.260> lightweight<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.950> most<00:00:35.489> responsive

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
most lightweight and most responsive

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.720 
most lightweight and most responsive
construction<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.829> use<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.280> their<00:00:38.489> line

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
construction that they use in their line

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.270 
construction that they use in their line
and<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.480> far<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> flex<00:00:40.170> profile<00:00:40.590> goes<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and as far as the flex profile goes this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
and as far as the flex profile goes this
is<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> constant<00:00:42.270> flex<00:00:42.660> profile

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is going to be a constant flex profile

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.900 
is going to be a constant flex profile
so<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.100> means<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so what that means is that from the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
so what that means is that from the
bottom<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> top<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.379> constant

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
bottom to the top it has a constant

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.069 
bottom to the top it has a constant
stiffness<00:00:47.370> rating<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.329> allows<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
stiffness rating and this allows the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
stiffness rating and this allows the
stick<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.649> change<00:00:50.070> its<00:00:50.399> flex<00:00:50.670> profile

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
stick to change its flex profile

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670 
stick to change its flex profile
depending<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:52.020> lower<00:00:52.260> hand<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
depending on where your lower hand is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
depending on where your lower hand is
place<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:53.789> you're<00:00:53.910> taking<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.239> big

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
place so when you're taking a big

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
place so when you're taking a big
clapper<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.350> big<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.800> timer<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> slide

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
clapper or a big one timer and you slide

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
clapper or a big one timer and you slide
your<00:00:56.850> hand<00:00:57.030> down<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.539> could<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.960> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
your hand down so you could really you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
your hand down so you could really you
know<00:00:58.800> flex<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.550> shaft<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
know flex out the shaft it's going to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
know flex out the shaft it's going to
give<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.989> mid<00:01:01.230> kick<00:01:01.440> point<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> it's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
give you that mid kick point and it's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830 
give you that mid kick point and it's
gonna<00:01:02.010> flex<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:03.059> near<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.660> lower

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
gonna flex right near where your lower

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
gonna flex right near where your lower
hand<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.229> located<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.400> when<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.670> looking

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
hand is located then when you're looking

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
hand is located then when you're looking
for<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.180> quick<00:01:06.330> release<00:01:06.450> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for that quick release kind of more of a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
for that quick release kind of more of a
low<00:01:07.920> kick<00:01:08.130> field<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.119> hand<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
low kick field and you got your hand a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
low kick field and you got your hand a
little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.840> higher<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> shaft<00:01:10.590> taking

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
little bit higher on the shaft taking

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
little bit higher on the shaft taking
that<00:01:11.460> quick<00:01:11.700> wrist<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.060> snap<00:01:12.299> shot<00:01:12.330> it's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that quick wrist in the snap shot it's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
that quick wrist in the snap shot it's
gonna<00:01:13.290> flex<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.130> higher<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.700> it's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
gonna flex a little bit higher and it's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.219 
gonna flex a little bit higher and it's
going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> give<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> low<00:01:15.720> kick<00:01:15.990> point

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
going to give you that low kick point

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.580 
going to give you that low kick point
with<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> lightning<00:01:17.189> quick<00:01:17.369> shot<00:01:17.610> release

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
with that lightning quick shot release

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
with that lightning quick shot release
as<00:01:19.590> far<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> blade<00:01:20.189> goes<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> where

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
as far as the blade goes this is where

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
as far as the blade goes this is where
we<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> biggest<00:01:21.840> change<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
we see the biggest change from that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
we see the biggest change from that
stage<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> eliminates<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
stage two now this eliminates one of the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
stage two now this eliminates one of the
middle<00:01:25.380> freak<00:01:25.650> channels<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.580> create<00:01:26.909> one

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
middle freak channels to create one

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
middle freak channels to create one
large<00:01:27.630> singular<00:01:28.110> speed<00:01:28.740> pocket<00:01:29.159> down<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
large singular speed pocket down the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
large singular speed pocket down the
center<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.750> those<00:01:30.869> speed

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
center and then you do have those speed

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
center and then you do have those speed
channels<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.619> run<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> edges<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
channels that run the edges here and it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.319 
channels that run the edges here and it
results<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> 50%<00:01:34.740> higher<00:01:35.009> core<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> core<00:01:36.119> is

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
results in 50% higher core and core is

coefficient of restitution essentially
it's<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.420> energy<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.140> velocity<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it's how much energy and velocity is

you're<00:01:43.320> shooting<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.670> stick

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you're shooting so with this stick

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
you're shooting so with this stick
you're<00:01:45.030> gonna<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:45.780> pop<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you're gonna get a lot more pop and a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.370 
you're gonna get a lot more pop and a
lot<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.070> velocity<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.750> through<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> puck

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
lot more velocity going through the puck

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
lot more velocity going through the puck
then<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> original<00:01:50.430> stage<00:01:50.670> two<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.149> had

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
then that original stage two that had

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.510 
then that original stage two that had
some<00:01:51.509> great<00:01:51.720> pop<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.439> well<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.280> also

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
some great pop to it as well it also

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
some great pop to it as well it also
still<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:53.939> some<00:01:54.240> great<00:01:54.479> puck<00:01:54.750> feel<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
still has some great puck feel but the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560 
still has some great puck feel but the
best<00:01:55.920> thing<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.299> hollow

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
best thing that I like about this hollow

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
best thing that I like about this hollow
and<00:01:57.810> thumb<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.200> blade<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> gives<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and thumb was blade is that it gives it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.850 
and thumb was blade is that it gives it
a<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.060> great<00:02:00.390> overall<00:02:00.869> balanced<00:02:01.350> feel<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
a really great overall balanced feel to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
a really great overall balanced feel to
it<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.520> call<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.939> swing<00:02:03.210> weight<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.630> they

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it they call this swing weight so they

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.630 
it they call this swing weight so they
really<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.590> tried<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> eliminate<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.399> much

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
really just tried to eliminate as much

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.399 
really just tried to eliminate as much
weight<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> lower<00:02:06.299> portion<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.930> possible

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
weight in the lower portion as possible

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.229 
weight in the lower portion as possible
so<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> raises<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.489> balance<00:02:08.940> point<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so it raises that balance point and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.690 
so it raises that balance point and
gives<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> great<00:02:09.780> balanced<00:02:10.229> feel<00:02:10.700> so

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
gives you that great balanced feel so

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
gives you that great balanced feel so
going<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> overall<00:02:12.450> looks<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.810> feel<00:02:12.959> this

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
going in the overall looks and feel this

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.830 
going in the overall looks and feel this

you<00:02:13.989> know<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> big<00:02:14.650> fan<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.370> red<00:02:15.580> paint

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
you know I'm a big fan of that red paint

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.210 
you know I'm a big fan of that red paint
job<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.750> first<00:02:16.959> couple<00:02:17.440> times<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.769> saw<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.040> no

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
job the first couple times I saw you no

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.820 
job the first couple times I saw you no
pictures<00:02:18.670> or<00:02:19.000> seen<00:02:19.870> them<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.140> games<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.650> thought

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
pictures or seen them in games I thought

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.170 
pictures or seen them in games I thought
it<00:02:20.920> might<00:02:21.099> have<00:02:21.160> been<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.610> too<00:02:21.879> bright

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
it might have been a little too bright

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.970 
it might have been a little too bright
but<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:22.840> once<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.140> finally<00:02:23.410> got<00:02:23.500> my<00:02:23.650> hands<00:02:23.920> on

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
but then once I finally got my hands on

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.190 
but then once I finally got my hands on
one<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.220> realize<00:02:24.640> no<00:02:24.879> it's<00:02:25.090> not<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.360> vibrant

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
one I realize no it's not that vibrant

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.229 
one I realize no it's not that vibrant
it's<00:02:26.590> not<00:02:26.739> over<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.129> top<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.670> think<00:02:27.819> they

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
it's not over the top so I think they

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.330 
it's not over the top so I think they
did<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> great<00:02:28.780> job<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.319> make<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> nice<00:02:30.010> unique

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
did a great job and make a nice unique

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.729 
did a great job and make a nice unique

that original RBZ a lot more pop than

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.069

with it just really explode it off the

with it just really explode it off the
blade<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.480> could<00:02:55.690> really<00:02:55.959> crank<00:02:56.200> out

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
blade and you could really crank out

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.050 
blade and you could really crank out
some<00:02:56.560> power<00:02:56.709> on<00:02:56.920> some<00:02:57.099> big<00:02:57.250> slap<00:02:57.519> shots<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:57.940> one
