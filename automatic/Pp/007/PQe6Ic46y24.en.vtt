00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.420
 People say 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.180
 The future is full of hope 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.640
 I think it's tough now 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.400
 It will be easier if time passes 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.020
 I hope for such a way and wait for the future 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.030
 But cellar 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.430
 I want you not to forget 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.440
 If you wish to walk in the future 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.440
 Sometimes I look back on the past 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.810
 It is a road that has been walked so far 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.810
 I hope to support you in the future 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.110

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.370
 Also diurnal period 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.130
 A story that can be heavenly 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.910
 Send light 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.140
 3 days Genichiro 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 Is this an eclipse? 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.370
 I know 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.610
 Have big Farsi appeared before about certain 100 years 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.010
 It went black for a while around the world 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.130
 talked 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.490
 Noel's age is 700 years later 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.970
 It's gonna be the world after 200 years now 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 I just strange 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.020
 Dark is given seems only here whole area 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.300
 The time and space is not good 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.909
 So Moshikashiteko Re' 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.780
 paradox 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.780
 Ariel removed 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.040
 Certainly this is true 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.570
 I think there was a time 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.940
 I Toshino of Gran pulse that perished long ago 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 What in there is this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.070
 I don't know much yet 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.760
 Because we are confined to the country 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.530
 I don't know much of the word of Scrunchus 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.570
 The research of Grand Pulse has started 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.570
 Recently I got a big ride 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.590
 If you have any problems with the tour, we will consult with you 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.189
 Oh I've been wanted to listen to here where 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.189

 12 9 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.580
 'M not after 200 years 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:27.160
 No, how many years now is the first question 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.160
 Pokkari Masataka Time Traveler

 Please bring this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.900
 It is dangerous if you have a brain 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:56.110
 Belly paradox yes 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.709
 The one who hid the sun is expected to be washed about 200 years in the giant falsi 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.209
 is 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.209

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.840
 Solar eclipse'm happening only in this side 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:15.409
 A lot of gates appear and distort space-time. 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.760
 I wonder if there is a gate at the back of the ruins 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:23.090
 It looks like you're familiar 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.090

 The safety may not have been confirmed 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.270
 Totally 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.800
 You should follow the light of the searchlight and walk 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.550
 This back is a path riser 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.650
