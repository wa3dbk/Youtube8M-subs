like you think of movies like Star Wars
and<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.860> think<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.160> score<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.580> and

everyone<00:02:26.270> knows<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.540> music<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:27.920> don't

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
everyone knows that music but I don't

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.500 
everyone knows that music but I don't
think<00:02:28.220> people<00:02:28.430> sometimes<00:02:28.730> realize<00:02:29.270> how

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
think people sometimes realize how

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.470 
think people sometimes realize how
important<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:31.010> composer<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> film<00:02:32.180> if

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
important the composer is on a film if

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.660 
important the composer is on a film if
you<00:02:32.630> watch<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.960> film<00:02:33.080> without<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.740> music<00:02:33.860> yeah

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
you watch a film without the music yeah

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.310 
you watch a film without the music yeah
doesn't<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.390> same<00:02:35.510> impact<00:02:35.810> at<00:02:36.020> all<00:02:36.080> as

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
doesn't have the same impact at all as

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.200 
doesn't have the same impact at all as
it<00:02:36.500> does<00:02:36.650> once<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.430> laid<00:02:37.640> out<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.060> i<00:02:38.090> think

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
it does once that is laid out so i think

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.670 
it does once that is laid out so i think
that's<00:02:38.540> super<00:02:39.020> important<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.440> he'll<00:02:39.590> be

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
that's super important and he'll be
