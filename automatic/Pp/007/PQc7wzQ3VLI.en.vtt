00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.910
 watsa everyone knows that I come 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.650
 especially for the sailboats that we at 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 the game call of duty alpine 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 warfare with my material rather a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.160
 video a bit negative towards and well the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.630
 developer we will say activition 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.060
 develops of course that the psychiatrist 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 warfare at which by here already 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 first small official kit information 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.210
 is that the game will not be available 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.189
 on the next gen platform and you Thursday 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 but an ex yellow in quotation marks yes 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.309
 ouf that is the game does not 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.750
 will not be compatible then I know that the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.550
 most are foot they will say yes but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.219
 I do not care I'm on ps4 where I 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.680
 am on xbox one or on xbox 360 or on 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
 playstation 3 good bah all that i quoted 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520
 do not worry she'll be on her 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 platforms there and she will also have to 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 not denigrate the pc platform she will be 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 available both on its platform 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 pc but it will not be available on the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.789
 wii platform or knowing that both 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.160
 two ancient times actually flea 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.870
 ie black up however yeah 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.149
 no it's call of duty gods and black ops 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.670
 So we take the right chain and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 well actually so smooth and f in cdi or these 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 two there were available on wiiu 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.650
 whereas when we look with call of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.119
 duty advance warfare unfortunately he 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.680
 will not be available on wii or so 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 we will say that treyarch a little 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 underestimated this finally on estimated more 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.049
 early this console there and then bah 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 now let's say they are more 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.689
 too interested in the number of sales 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.850
 which is about 100 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.350
 hundred of thousands of sales on the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 wii or and let's say that activision 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.130
 this is not an interest for them if 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 and a lot of good precious matches 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 I'm not on wii or but in any 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.729
 case the people who are on wiiu down they 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.329
 will not be able to access their little ones 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.250
 call of duty 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 so it's true that we can do a 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.710
 debate we can talk about it for thirty 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.810
 forty minutes 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.290
 we will say that call of duty or at the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 on wii on wii it's not those voices there 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.159
 it's not the sea resolution it's not the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.079
 sea quality the best fluidity this was 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.070
 agree with you gentlemen attention 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.810
 telling you is that it is 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.579
 a shame because we are going to say that they 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.110
 could have played a little low on the next 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.130
 gen is at the coal or zoo could 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.450
 play a little you know with the little 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.969
 tablet or do things like that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.570
 with to trigger things or 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.280
 little gadgets in fact finally that there 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.140
 where she offers us he could have played 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.310
 a bit about this game finally on this system 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.960
 there maybe they did not want 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.660
 put too much time and then finally 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.040
 not have a huge success that's for sure 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.240
 will have a huge success on wiiu 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.100
 but here and there I find that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.870
 it's a shame and that's good 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 have apparently a little overestimated the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.340
 Console is now good bah 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.570
 here 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.030
 he actually underestimated eventually they 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.600
 are saying here so now these are 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.300
 not say that 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.300
 this platform is not enough for us 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.400
 any heavy case will not make us 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.200
 as much money as finally here after 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.800
 it's not sure it's not safe 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.750
 Anyway it's my impression 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.000
 frankly it's his salad maybe 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.180
 rather formal so what you need to know 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.130
 also it is that there is an exclusivity I 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.890
 you had already talked about microsoft has in 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.959
 done on xbox consoles well I 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.640
 I'm necessarily squeezing on xbox one or on 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.140
 xbox 360 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.900
 an exclusivity that will allow you 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.850
 to have the dlc in advance a month before 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.610
 so people who are at sony's on 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.200
 playstation 4 or on playstation 3 halak 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.780
 is good here it is a kind of small 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.400
 advance that they have people who are on 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 xbox one or xbox 360 but they will 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.120
 happy the other bombay will moan a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.410
 little also the pc platform that annoys me to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.720
 this platform p 6 months before I was 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.130
 player pc and well it's galore it's 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.920
 galley a platform pc that is to say 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.440
 we have we have we are completely 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.120
 we forget what limits because at 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.040
 down the dlc all that we do not talk 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.239
 almost never actually actually on 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.650
 this platform there which is a pity 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.269
 but here's where to go 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.890
 also it is that there attention they are 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.440
 speculation rumors so this is 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.910
 no truth is not sure and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.829
 I honestly tell you right 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.930
 I do not want it to be 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.489
 official part thing so they 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.350
 are actually confirmed by acti 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.610
 vision is that it will do a little 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.640
 like the old call of duty to 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.650
 which is the xbox platform 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.079
 will be of a lower resolution than the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.450
 playstation platform 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:56.019
 that is to say that we estimate the game call 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.860
 of duty advance warfare that will be located 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.950
 between 810 1,900 pixels but what about 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.090
 what a fat people what the fuck wells 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.370
 and that's just anything 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.450
 in any case I hope not 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.709
 are remarks for the moment at 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.810
 About this is the only small 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.129
 rumor of the video that turns 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.840
 a lot on sites about poems 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.150
 on resource tweets by 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.590
 tweets 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.540
 ddd you company anyway they have 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.010
 tweeted this stuff is shocking 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.959
 I hope not in any case that 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.820
 call of duty end rather than 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.710
 activision develop their game and that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.090
 on xbox there is a good good 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.389
 resolution knowing that an exclusive 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.949
 on it would be fucking that would be it 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.510
 would it be strange what or finally 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.160
 I do not know frankly I'm a 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.330
 little lost there I do not understand too much so 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.039
 in any case I hope that it will be done 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.900
 of course europe on playstation this will be 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.400
 to a thousand and a few pixels so the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.830
 resolution on one is going to say very good 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.820
 on on playstation 4 will be playstation 3 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.460
 in any case it will be of a quality 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.110
 normal and on xbox wang anyway 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.389
 for now or xbox 360 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.300
 we expect quality in fact 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.090
 finally the bottom of all this image 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.229
 less than that of the playsation 3 or 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.030
 playstation 4 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.139
 I find it a bit of a shame anyway 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.919
 it's not official so know my 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.060
 in any case I'm trying to get you 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.860
 say for now I'll tell you from 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.940
 that it will be where it will be official we are 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.229
 soon it will not be official right now 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.789
 because not necessarily active vision and 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.099
 do not want to belittle 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.450
 wide here is self vassner people thank you 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.130
 to put a little one I like a dream of that 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.510
 is super fun everything says on my page 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.889
 personal facebook thanks to all
