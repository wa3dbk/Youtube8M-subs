00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.470
 to change the spark plugs we have to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.150
 lift the first this stage and here 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.430
 normally the lid is removed better 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.130
 When the car has clear temperature 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.810
 you put on some gloves and you have to pull 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.700
 she up has an anchor here 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.210
 another anchor here and another here more or 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.140
 less and another at this point chooses with the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.180
 hand and throw 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.350
 in this sense up 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.790
 is usually well hooked 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.790
 and it usually costs to remove it 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.890
 A) Yes 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.320
 these are the hooks where is 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.940
 hooked the lid with some whistles that 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.879
 they're stuffed like that and then they're left 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.890
 hooked are the four we have there are 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.410
 24 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.410
 is to pull up to get it out 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 these four coils is where the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.800
 spark plugs you have to take and take the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.770
 Each coil has two screws 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 and the screws all are some more 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 easy to remove than others for example 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.790
 here in this one here, it will be 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.810
 raise this a bit to be able to put 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.810
 the nut the socket wrench and power 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 unscrew 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.860
 I have obviously opted to do the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.610
 change the spark plugs when the car 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.610
 it is cold 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.130
 so he avoided burning min 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.900
 before loosening the two screws 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.940
 disconnect from here the connection this 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.000
 has has some tabs on the sides 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.330
 that are pressed and pulled back 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.770
 I can not reach a hand 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.770
 red and separate it 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.909
 we take out the screws 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.780
 screw piece 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.450
 and then pulling up 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.870
 comes out what is the defended coil 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.650
 eye that is not small the mother coil 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.140
 mine 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.629
 well there we have the hole and if we 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.030
 We peeked a little more there to see 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.290
 spark plug background 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.290
 and now let's go for it 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.959
 I have taken the spark plug wrench that is this 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:12.540
 and this is size 16, it's pretty 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.780
 I think that if I am worthy and have 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.410
 added the extender this to see if it is 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 enough 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:29.090
 at this height it's going to be very fair 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.090
 have use the other that is higher 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.290
 Here we go with this extender filler 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.960
 with this we have to arrive but well 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.960
 also with this transit comfortably 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.750
 I no longer have cancer on the march 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.750
 now I put caracas 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.800
 come on let's take out 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.060
 we ended up loosening it by hand 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.230
 well we take the new spark plug this and the 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.840
 we prepare 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.380
 in the same place 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.380
 for 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.990
 OK 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.440
 we remove this now we put again the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.440
 Spark plug new country 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.300
 for your hole 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.140
 and we are scratching little by little with the hand 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.440
 we take the metric dynamo key and 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.440
 we finished tightening it 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.769
 with the correct tightening torque 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.810
 finally we are putting the coil of 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.810
 turned on in its place 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.310
 we put the screws in place 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.310
 let's fit a bit 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.310
 we squeeze 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.310
 let's squeeze until we can 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:16.420
 ok we take the metric dynamo key 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.200
 we put the right pair 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.340
 and we go squeezing 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.340
 until it jumps 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.580
 finally put the lid through 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.900
 over we adjust it well 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.250
 squeezing by hand 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.250
 and finished the process
