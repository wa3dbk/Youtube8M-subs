 and hello to all and already and who today 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.830
 made a new video of my table of 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.150
 Mixing end my usb controller in 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.839
 pioneer of which I am part of the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.660
 family ddj so here is the ddjs b 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.109
 so here it is the smallest of the good DJs 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.199
 away no bigger than already done 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.740
 to leap that the hercules is this is the priest 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.470
 recoiled it stops at the beckham in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.950
 from where the calm so we will start 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.570
 so by the knobs so there 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.129
 finally infiltrated two of the five 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.809
 voice it's a small effect the bass the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.149
 mediums and vegetables will not help 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.770
 the other side here is the calf life 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.440
 to choose the music on 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.329
 the computer so here I beat them is a 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.760
 true on two but that on the good 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.379
 music does me that or that to put on 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.059
 this platinum where his platinum hair 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.269
 there you choose 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.289
 here if the qte to activate the puzzle 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.570
 or disable 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.430
 this is the master the beautiful so me 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.950
 I always put a background because 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.549
 with the computer of music dvd times 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.710
 who they are who is downloaded and who 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.189
 is not strong enough so that's so 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.009
 that's headphone volume always at 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.560
 bottom also that's the feeling the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:30.079
 we scratch sorry if I talk like that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.930
 his rugby today learn to 9 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.009
 buttons of each platinum end below 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.170
 of each turntable here it's your the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.750
 served roadshows so 4 that we can 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.680
 to make cars so magnifying glass so the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.780
 magnolia for example we do that the wolf 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 get in there and hop to validate it hop 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.979
 does august and so it's hunting 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 or of these vouchers registered and excites 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.420
 it's to have a start with a flourish 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.789
 like that brews and the sampler we can 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.070
 put anything noises of 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.170
 animal or door there is play 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.020
 break as everyone knows the kg 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.790
 in the main the acronym so 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200
 synchronization it shifts 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.630
 to learn I would have to come back on 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.480
 the manual 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 I know because if we do it then 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.620
 it's a micro plug personally I 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 do not use it, it's the volume 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.440
 of the microphone the microphone so it's for the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.390
 big micro 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.370
 which is much more here now 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 to give me a helmet necessarily 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.520
 these guys there that the herculean is towards a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.330
 small to himself but with a big boom 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:40.400
 we can see here we have the master volume 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.680
 up to 8% and up to -8% 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.040
 we have the little filter effect here too 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.560
 when we change music like that we 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.330
 knows a view mixer so 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.080
 the main favors here after the coy 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.510
 a box and so does otherwise the software 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.450
 serato so yes here I specify these 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.870
 well to a dj cerrato it's a lot 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.520
 better if for professionals we have 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.330
 has the effects we want so I put 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.730
 filters as here we can this is the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.200
 little echo sister is separated from 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.550
 the other side so pretty much it should 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.970
 to be good there it is for the headphones listen 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.430
 what for music 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.790
 so do not go very thick 1 girls 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.790
 like that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:44.640
 these light and there we have two outputs rca 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.380
 red and white a precise game also after 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.270
 I do not know if you make this sound of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.970
 like me, you always have to turn it on 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.670
 before turning the amp it because, 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.350
 do if you do not turn on the amp far 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 we put that on the computer and we 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.240
 turn on the amp after that bugger the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.100
 software does sarko is not the the 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.860
 platinum in fact it's good it's true 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.190
 not terrible in the system but hey he 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.160
 we need to be used here 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:19.709
 scratch the main loan that can 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:23.250
 to do for the tempo the pitch alone 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.560
 tpo ranch is to keep 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.889
 the same way when we increase or in 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.530
 drop you know no small voices 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.840
 all this ah yeah so now we 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.590
 are going to talk about climb are actually we 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.780
 also changed the handles we put some 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.879
 existing and hanging feathers 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.139
 because before that it was stuff that he 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.819
 was all about it like that and he 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.960
 had no hollow to put the hand 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.330
 good it's already better and I made a 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.430
 new box that is not there these 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.860
 box points for all dispatches 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.479
 China so I have 3 1 of 5.26 and 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.720
 induced 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.940
 so here you go see on my dj page 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.110
 lexsi on facebook because you will see 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.870
 many more videos and photos 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.229
 it's advantageous for you too 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.819
 and put a little young person instead 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.139

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.139
