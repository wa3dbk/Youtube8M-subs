number<00:02:38.739> five<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:41.140> design<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.890> do<00:02:42.819> have<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.299> hand

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

it to the creators the design for the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.569 
it to the creators the design for the
films<00:02:46.359> are<00:02:46.540> really<00:02:46.840> good<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.319> like<00:02:48.219> how<00:02:48.400> they

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
films are really good I like how they

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.830 
films are really good I like how they
did<00:02:48.730> most<00:02:48.939> of<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> worlds<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.510> Star<00:02:49.810> Wars

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
did most of the worlds in Star Wars

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.190 
did most of the worlds in Star Wars
keeping<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.739> concepts<00:02:51.400> very<00:02:51.879> simple<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.480> it

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
keeping the concepts very simple and it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.660 
keeping the concepts very simple and it
seems<00:02:53.439> to<00:02:53.530> be<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.769> as<00:02:53.920> effective<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.579> the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
seems to be just as effective and the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.270 
seems to be just as effective and the
prequels<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.139> originals<00:02:56.590> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
prequels as it is in the originals the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.979 
prequels as it is in the originals the
same<00:02:57.519> thing<00:02:57.909> can<00:02:58.209> be<00:02:58.269> said<00:02:58.359> about<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.659> visual

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
same thing can be said about the visual

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.440 
same thing can be said about the visual
effects<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.590> know<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.639> said<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.120> wasn't<00:03:01.299> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
effects I know I said it wasn't the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.479 
effects I know I said it wasn't the
issue<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:02.290> at<00:03:02.379> least<00:03:02.680> they<00:03:03.010> went<00:03:03.250> out<00:03:03.430> of

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
issue but at least they went out of

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.610 
issue but at least they went out of
their<00:03:03.670> way<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.969> make<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.359> look<00:03:04.540> good<00:03:04.599> it's<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
their way to make it look good it's a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.410 
their way to make it look good it's a
double-edged<00:03:06.010> sword<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:06.969> i<00:03:07.000> will<00:03:07.209> give

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
double-edged sword but i will give
