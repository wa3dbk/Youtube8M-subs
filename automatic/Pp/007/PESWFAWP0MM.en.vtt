here<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:27.070> can't<00:02:27.370> change<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.940> they're<00:02:28.270> stuck

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.750 
here you can't change that they're stuck
like<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.960> there<00:02:29.620> isn't<00:02:29.800> any<00:02:30.100> sort<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.550> foot

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
like that there isn't any sort of foot

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.030 
like that there isn't any sort of foot
articulation<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.380> think<00:02:32.620> that's<00:02:32.800> pretty

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
articulation and I think that's pretty

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.490 
articulation and I think that's pretty
weird<00:02:33.280> because<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:33.940> kind<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.350> makes<00:02:35.350> them

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
weird because it just kind of makes them

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
weird because it just kind of makes them
stand<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.190> an<00:02:36.850> interesting<00:02:37.120> way<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:40.090> other

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
stand in an interesting way but other

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270 
stand in an interesting way but other
than<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.840> his<00:02:41.200> articulation<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:42.040> pretty

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
than that his articulation is pretty

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.500 
than that his articulation is pretty
good<00:02:42.490> I'll<00:02:42.610> get<00:02:42.730> into<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.120> I'll<00:02:43.330> go<00:02:43.450> ahead

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
good I'll get into that I'll go ahead

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.360 
good I'll get into that I'll go ahead
and<00:02:43.720> take<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.020> glasses<00:02:44.260> off<00:02:44.560> here<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.190> can

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
and take the glasses off here so you can

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.140 
and take the glasses off here so you can
see<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:47.680> do<00:02:47.740> have<00:02:48.130> if<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.820> see<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.090> can

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
see they do have if you see you can

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.870 
see they do have if you see you can
follow<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.840> hairline<00:02:50.320> there<00:02:50.650> that's<00:02:51.550> how<00:02:51.730> his

go up above the ear there so you can

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.180 
go up above the ear there so you can
just<00:03:01.840> slide<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.470> kind<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> clips<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.100> on

just slide it in it kind of clips it on
this<00:03:03.340> side<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:04.120> doesn't<00:03:04.420> go<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.900> as<00:03:05.050> well<00:03:05.080> on

is<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.410> ball<00:03:26.650> joint<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:27.100> didn't<00:03:27.430> think<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.670> was<00:03:27.730> a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
is a ball joint I didn't think it was a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.370 
is a ball joint I didn't think it was a
ball<00:03:28.000> joint<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.570> is<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.690> ball<00:03:28.930> joint<00:03:29.110> you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
ball joint but it is a ball joint you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.250 
ball joint but it is a ball joint you
can<00:03:29.530> see<00:03:29.709> there<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:31.090> feels<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.510> little<00:03:31.600> odd<00:03:31.959> as

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
can see there it feels a little odd as

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.630 
can see there it feels a little odd as
though<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.530> might<00:03:32.560> break<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:33.160> don't<00:03:33.310> think<00:03:33.519> it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
though it might break I don't think it

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.789 
though it might break I don't think it
will<00:03:33.820> but<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.780> kind<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.170> feeling<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:35.620> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
will but it is kind of feeling like that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.220 
will but it is kind of feeling like that
right<00:03:36.010> now<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.190> I'm<00:03:36.430> gonna<00:03:36.519> stop<00:03:36.760> moving<00:03:37.060> it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
right now so I'm gonna stop moving it

the<00:03:58.510> wrist<00:03:58.660> articulation<00:03:58.840> because<00:03:59.530> usually

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
the wrist articulation because usually

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.729 
the wrist articulation because usually
if<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:00.640> see<00:04:00.820> here<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:02.110> hand<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> lot

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
if you see here that the hand is a lot

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.610 
if you see here that the hand is a lot
thinner<00:04:02.980> here<00:04:03.459> than<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.360> here<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:04.900> since

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
thinner here than it is here so since

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.380 
thinner here than it is here so since
it's<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:05.830> lot<00:04:05.980> wider<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.580> weird<00:04:06.820> like<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.030> it

hollow<00:05:31.720> on<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.139> back<00:05:32.849> but<00:05:33.849> it<00:05:33.940> has<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.060> nice

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
hollow on the back but it has a nice

hollow on the back but it has a nice
facade<00:05:34.840> there<00:05:35.849> and<00:05:36.849> then<00:05:37.000> he's<00:05:37.120> got<00:05:37.300> this

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479

of stickers that comes with them I think
there's<00:05:41.650> eight<00:05:41.889> stickers<00:05:42.340> so<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.520> get<00:05:42.639> to

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
there's eight stickers so you get to

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.909
