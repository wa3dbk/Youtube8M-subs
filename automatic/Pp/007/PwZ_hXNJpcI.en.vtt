00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
there and blocked if the chip damage

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.970 
there and blocked if the chip damage
would<00:05:59.820> have<00:05:59.880> taken<00:06:00.150> it<00:06:00.390> no<00:06:01.140> yeah<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.650> was<00:06:01.800> not

a<00:06:02.040> chip<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.490> don't<00:06:02.760> think<00:06:02.940> so<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.330> think<00:06:03.540> that<00:06:03.960> he

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
a chip I don't think so I think that he

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.960 
a chip I don't think so I think that he
would<00:06:04.530> have<00:06:04.680> lived<00:06:04.950> in<00:06:05.160> his<00:06:05.400> block<00:06:05.670> and<00:06:05.910> you
