 ingredients for this recipe let me 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.260
 tell them that I bought this yogurt is 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.630
 true these regular yogurts of the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.290
 marqueta I bought this that is being 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.170
 of how it's called lemon and this other 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.660
 that is being peach and this other 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.670
 that comes from strawberry I was very 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.710
 colorless so I decided to put a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.200
 little bit of color truth nothing else very 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.960
 little bit to give them this color that I 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 I wanted but in itself it's a yogurt and I 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.530
 I bought you are in a market to me 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 they liked it a lot because the stick is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.330
 well long and as you can see then look 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 It will reach in and are easier 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.160
 to jump I have these but the stick 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.470
 it's not as long as you can see I do not know 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.940
 if my camera can see it then it gives me 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.400
 a little bit of a problem when it comes to 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.950
 unmold what's why I decided that 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.750
 this time I'm going to use these sticks and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.240

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
