00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 yes he down every idiot I'm going 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.569
 give you the link to the score 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.639
 because there is already a lot on 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.300
 Russian internet and then I can put 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.849
 on facebook a picture actually that's it 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.160
 it's not a problem we'll always have 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.740
 the ability to delete the page is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.439
 so enjoy the first piece 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.590
 so in fact they start there you can 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.050
 so actually it starts with shares 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 arm games in six years 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:43.920
 all this for the rabbit on the drum 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:50.420
 so here's the distance their side the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.420
 stars further away it's a charm 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:03.840
 So here is the free movement of unstuck 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 natural housings so here at and how 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.220
 play with the third must because 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.650
 the third must is the center of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 symmetry it's the most practical it's the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.590
 heavier it's the most stable so to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.229
 owls and the isi you played with the thumb 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 and with the 5th because in the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.060
 other methods when you look at the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.280
 pieces in quotation marks easy one you 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.100
 asks to play with a 5th move 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.439
 we follow the position tome because the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 no one still controls and knows 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.049
 not how to do that to avoid that and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.979
 she begins first the third after 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.810
 eva to bring in 2nd 4th and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.090
 only after when are you going 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.509
 feel very stable in this position 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 you added what pushes me and that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.220
 is going to be the killer and the easy ones are 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.220
 so the first piece 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 the door that can do that so forward 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.150
 from 2 years old an adult who has not 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.849
 never touched the piano it's very easy 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:36.260
 and its jewels this is called the waltz of 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:39.110
 dogs in a second step like 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.500
 the student learns this piece after the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.940
 teacher or the parent plays the second 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.470
 part well like me so looked at it 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.480
 not my fingering because there I go 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.650
 do both the same right it's 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.349
 the pupil's left hand 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.410
 the teacher will give room to the 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.410
 end 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.360
 stop
