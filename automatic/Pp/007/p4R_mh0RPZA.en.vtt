00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.420
 you know what there in Suriname 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.419
 we have just returned we have done a fantastic performance there 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.110
 kurt would have been a little bit myself on aruba to experience nothing 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.099
 but eventually 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 look i am suriname but i am then does not exist 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.550
 the beauty of life is not you 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.210
 as if i could have done anything with the parents here were more expensive from better 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.839
 you have no influence on it 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.569
 the award ceremony 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.999
 and if you go to Suriname then 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.460
 there you get in the eve so there is always lived Surinamese own 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
 challengers second session 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.710
 but I actually think it should be 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.620
 I felt the coziness of the voices 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.220
 personal 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.160
 and I was there last year even though I have been there again this year what strikes me 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 to the two subjects of this good euro file 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 the only two topics that are public 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.600
 given the odds and they don't 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 he goes the party goes 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.470
 after the departure of the attacker david depetris video 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580
 own message 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.670
 from that says 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.310
 as a presenter 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.240
 occasionally stuck 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 mid April 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.450
 it's a subject that the Surinamese don't talk about that meziani seen 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.730
 this everything going on in your life they come sit 3 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 you don't know is dead 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.520
 the first team 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 I attach great value to tackling 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.350
 this showed that he says the drug is dead 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.200
 this can easily go across the street 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 not that the Brabant newspaper wrote that team
