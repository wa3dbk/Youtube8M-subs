I<00:00:24.990> saw<00:00:25.590> Italy<00:00:25.859> while<00:00:26.099> ago<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.420> sort<00:00:27.689> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
I saw Italy while ago you know sort of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.679 
I saw Italy while ago you know sort of
they<00:00:28.470> had<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:28.769> signed<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.150> think

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
they had it down signed off and I think

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
they had it down signed off and I think
your<00:00:30.779> first<00:00:30.900> impression<00:00:31.470> tells<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lot

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and straightaway I thought to myself

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.780 
and straightaway I thought to myself
that<00:00:34.260> looks<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.070> an<00:00:35.190> old<00:00:35.309> oak<00:00:35.430> Jersey<00:00:35.730> should

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
let's fix it why it's pretty tight as

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.169 
let's fix it why it's pretty tight as
well<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:07.140> doesn't<00:02:07.979> feel<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.910> too

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
well but doesn't feel like it's too

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.639 
well but doesn't feel like it's too
tight<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> pass<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> things<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
tight to pass and things like that so

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.160 
tight to pass and things like that so
it's<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:11.640> good<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.209> snap<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> body

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
