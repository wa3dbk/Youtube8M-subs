now<00:00:05.890> the<00:00:05.980> next<00:00:06.190> technique<00:00:06.640> will<00:00:06.880> be<00:00:07.000> looking

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
now the next technique will be looking

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.240 
now the next technique will be looking
at<00:00:07.390> is<00:00:07.540> fire<00:00:08.109> lighting<00:00:08.469> using<00:00:08.770> the<00:00:08.860> flint<00:00:09.130> and

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
at is fire lighting using the flint and

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.190 
at is fire lighting using the flint and
steel<00:00:09.430> method<00:00:09.940> now<00:00:10.540> we<00:00:10.629> have<00:00:10.750> here<00:00:10.900> a<00:00:10.960> piece<00:00:11.139> of

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
steel method now we have here a piece of

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.379

into<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.090> fire<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.630> keep<00:01:06.840> an<00:01:06.990> eye<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.350> as

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
into a fire and you keep an eye on it as

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.680 
into a fire and you keep an eye on it as
it<00:01:07.770> burns<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> thick<00:01:09.150> stream<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
it burns and you have a thick stream of

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.210 
it burns and you have a thick stream of
white<00:01:09.900> smoke<00:01:10.140> coming<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.800> top<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
white smoke coming out of the top of the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
white smoke coming out of the top of the
tin<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.360> smoke<00:01:12.720> stops<00:01:12.990> coming<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.440> or

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
tin when that smoke stops coming out or

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
tin when that smoke stops coming out or
turns<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.369> light<00:01:14.970> bluish<00:01:15.420> tinge

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
turns to a very light bluish tinge

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.230 
turns to a very light bluish tinge
that's<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> take<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.940> tin<00:01:18.119> out

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that's the time you can take the tin out

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's the time you can take the tin out
of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> fire<00:01:18.630> allow<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> cool<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.410> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
of the fire allow it to cool down and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
of the fire allow it to cool down and
when<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> open<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> tin<00:01:20.910> you'll<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.540> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
when you open the tin you'll have this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.070 
when you open the tin you'll have this
stuff<00:01:21.960> char<00:01:22.440> cloth<00:01:22.790> now<00:01:23.790> char<00:01:24.060> cloth<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.869> is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
stuff char cloth now char cloth was is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.290 
stuff char cloth now char cloth was is
so<00:01:25.710> fine<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> will<00:01:26.280> catch<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.760> lightest<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
so fine it will catch the lightest of

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.210 
so fine it will catch the lightest of
sparks<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> should<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.830> trouble<00:01:28.860> at

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
sparks so we should have no trouble at

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.670 
sparks so we should have no trouble at
all<00:01:29.400> getting<00:01:29.640> these<00:01:30.509> sparks<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.200> catch<00:01:31.410> on<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
all getting these sparks to catch on to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.060 
all getting these sparks to catch on to
it<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> hold<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> char<00:01:34.920> cloth

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it so what I do is hold the char cloth

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.150 
it so what I do is hold the char cloth
just<00:01:35.310> above<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> piece<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> Flint<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.160> that

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
just above the piece of Flint and that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.430 
just above the piece of Flint and that
allows<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> sparks<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.270> upwards<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.170> into

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
allows the sparks to go upwards and into

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.020 
allows the sparks to go upwards and into
the<00:01:40.530> char<00:01:40.830> cloth<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.310> we've<00:01:41.490> already<00:01:41.700> caught

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the char cloth now we've already caught

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
the char cloth now we've already caught
a<00:01:42.060> small<00:01:42.390> spark<00:01:42.690> here<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> make

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a small spark here it's going to make

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.440 
a small spark here it's going to make
sure<00:01:44.340> we've<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.700> couple<00:01:44.850> more<00:01:45.200> that's<00:01:46.200> fine

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
sure we've got a couple more that's fine

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.919 
sure we've got a couple more that's fine
you<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.690> that<00:01:49.700> that's<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.850> extremely<00:01:51.420> hot

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
you see that that's an extremely hot

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.389 
you see that that's an extremely hot
temperature<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.860> should<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.160> no<00:01:53.369> trouble

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
temperature so we should have no trouble

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.779 
temperature so we should have no trouble
at<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.850> allowing<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.550> ignite<00:01:56.550> the

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
at all allowing that to ignite the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.059 
at all allowing that to ignite the
dreiss<00:01:57.179> dry<00:01:57.899> straw<00:01:58.319> i<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:59.750> wrap<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.780> up

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
dreiss dry straw i have here wrap it up

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.330 
dreiss dry straw i have here wrap it up
and<00:02:02.569> now<00:02:03.569> we<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.869> need<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:05.009> some<00:02:05.160> oxygen

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and now we just need to get some oxygen

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:16.309 
and now we just need to get some oxygen
into<00:02:05.910> it

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.199 

now<00:02:17.319> we<00:02:17.379> have<00:02:17.650> fire<00:02:18.310> lighting<00:02:18.730> using<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
now we have fire lighting using the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.340 
now we have fire lighting using the
flint<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.569> steel<00:02:22.080> simple

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.740 

this<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.310> called<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.670> firesteel<00:02:30.210> some<00:02:30.510> people

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
this is called a firesteel some people

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.920 
this is called a firesteel some people
call<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.110> Ferro<00:02:31.470> rod<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.940> synthetic<00:02:33.270> bar

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
call it a Ferro rod it's a synthetic bar
