house<00:00:00.269> I<00:00:00.539> want<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.840> first<00:00:01.230> use<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.560> separate<00:00:02.659> 12

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
house I want to first use a separate 12

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.210 
house I want to first use a separate 12
x<00:00:04.250> 12<00:00:05.250> here<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.359> want<00:00:06.569> us<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.690> use<00:00:06.930> first<00:00:07.259> we're

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
x 12 here I want us to use first we're

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.970 
x 12 here I want us to use first we're
going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> shift<00:00:08.730> his<00:00:09.030> power<00:00:09.410> the<00:00:10.410> takedown

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
going to shift his power the takedown

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
going to shift his power the takedown
we're<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.400> use<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:13.340> this<00:00:14.340> way<00:00:14.870> with

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
we're going to use is this this way with

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.330 
we're going to use is this this way with
this<00:00:15.990> force<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.529> each<00:00:16.590> other<00:00:17.630> but<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:20.070> way<00:00:20.189> it

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this force on each other but the way it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.609 
this force on each other but the way it
works<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.910> his<00:00:21.090> power<00:00:21.359> he<00:00:21.600> pushes<00:00:21.930> hard<00:00:22.170> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
works is his power he pushes hard it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.580 
works is his power he pushes hard it's
going<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.039> which<00:00:23.430> hotel<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.170> in

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
going in which hotel in like so in in

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.150 
going in which hotel in like so in in
push<00:00:26.130> hard<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> separate<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
push hard in like so so I separate it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
push hard in like so so I separate it
this<00:00:29.550> way<00:00:29.730> i<00:00:29.760> take<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.269> force<00:00:30.599> off<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
this way i take this force off to the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
this way i take this force off to the
siphoning<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> wish<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.730> take<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.149> off<00:00:33.360> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
siphoning so I wish to take it off so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.889 
siphoning so I wish to take it off so
it's<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> little<00:00:34.140> bit<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:35.059> subtle<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.510> angle

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it's a little bit more subtle this angle

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.590 
it's a little bit more subtle this angle
is<00:00:37.050> sliding<00:00:37.500> off<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.070> he's<00:00:38.309> hit

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
is sliding off it's like he's hit

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.709 
is sliding off it's like he's hit
something<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:39.780> not<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.579> throw<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
something that's not there the throw the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.260 
something that's not there the throw the
impetus<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> throw<00:00:43.980> comes<00:00:44.820> from<00:00:45.120> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
impetus for the throw comes from this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
impetus for the throw comes from this
power<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.160> I've<00:00:47.160> allowed<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.730> shift<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
power that I've allowed to shift and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
power that I've allowed to shift and
then<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.539> squeeze<00:00:48.600> his<00:00:49.260> elbow<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.190> goes

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
then I squeeze his elbow as this goes

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
then I squeeze his elbow as this goes
behind<00:00:51.000> him<00:00:51.180> essentially<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.140> White<00:00:52.289> Crane

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
behind him essentially it's White Crane

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.970 
behind him essentially it's White Crane

and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.989> straighten<00:01:00.989> etro<00:01:02.180> essentially

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and I just straighten etro essentially

where we're trying to get to 12 this way

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.950 
where we're trying to get to 12 this way
it's<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> very<00:01:22.730> common<00:01:23.000> entry<00:01:23.360> for<00:01:23.540> our<00:01:23.600> patient

back loose to here just when you're
training<00:01:30.830> this<00:01:31.070> arm<00:01:31.400> bar<00:01:31.610> yeah<00:01:32.150> are<00:01:32.240> two<00:01:32.450> here

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
training this arm bar yeah are two here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.780 
training this arm bar yeah are two here
if<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.470> wish<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.800> control<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.220> person<00:01:34.610> more

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
if you wish to control the person more

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.600 
if you wish to control the person more
change<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:36.260> poober<00:01:36.650> into<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.010> person's<00:01:37.400> down

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
change to poober into the person's down

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.890 
change to poober into the person's down
to<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.850> ground<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.420> different<00:01:38.810> directions

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
to the ground in different directions

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.610 
to the ground in different directions
because<00:01:39.970> Jeannie<00:01:40.970> has<00:01:41.210> two<00:01:41.540> different<00:01:41.990> ways

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
because Jeannie has two different ways

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.490 
because Jeannie has two different ways
of<00:01:42.830> moving<00:01:43.010> one<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.180> quar<00:01:44.540> takes<00:01:44.900> me<00:01:45.080> up<00:01:45.290> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
of moving one the quar takes me up and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.010 
of moving one the quar takes me up and
down<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> if<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.000> need<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.360> manipulate<00:01:47.510> my

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
down so if I need to manipulate my

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.430 
down so if I need to manipulate my
height<00:01:48.320> my<00:01:48.590> quad<00:01:49.100> does<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.750> goes<00:01:50.750> up<00:01:50.960> maybe<00:01:51.350> I

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
height my quad does this goes up maybe I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.020 
height my quad does this goes up maybe I
need<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.740> move<00:01:51.860> jaime<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:52.400> need<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.580> press<00:01:52.850> it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
need to move jaime we need to press it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.740 
need to move jaime we need to press it
with<00:01:53.300> center<00:01:53.690> doesn't<00:01:54.350> really<00:01:54.590> matter<00:01:55.750> this

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
with center doesn't really matter this

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.930 
with center doesn't really matter this
area<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.470> waste<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:58.070> you've<00:01:58.460> been<00:01:58.640> spinning

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
area the waste that you've been spinning

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.260 
area the waste that you've been spinning
gives<00:01:59.869> me<00:02:00.050> left<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.470> right<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.880> my<00:02:02.030> waist

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
gives me left and right so my waist

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.810 
gives me left and right so my waist
turns<00:02:02.630> side<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.170> side<00:02:03.380> if<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.830> need<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.040> cheerly

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
turns side to side if I need to cheerly

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.850 
turns side to side if I need to cheerly
change<00:02:05.119> directional<00:02:05.720> cut<00:02:05.960> across<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.320> angle

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
change directional cut across to angle

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.609 
change directional cut across to angle
and<00:02:07.009> my<00:02:07.400> quad<00:02:07.700> goes<00:02:07.910> up<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.240> down<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.380> to
