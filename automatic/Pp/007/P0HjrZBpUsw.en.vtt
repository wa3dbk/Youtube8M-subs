hello again it was only yesterday I

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.230 
hello again it was only yesterday I
I<00:00:07.910> uploaded<00:00:08.690> a<00:00:08.929> video<00:00:09.610> showing<00:00:10.610> parts<00:00:11.059> on

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
I uploaded a video showing parts on

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.100 
I uploaded a video showing parts on
scraps<00:00:11.660> from<00:00:11.840> an<00:00:12.019> old<00:00:12.200> dishwasher<00:00:12.890> and<00:00:14.110> I

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
scraps from an old dishwasher and I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.859 
scraps from an old dishwasher and I
mentioned<00:00:15.769> B<00:00:16.070> I<00:00:16.099> had<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.519> irrigation<00:00:17.449> system<00:00:17.840> to

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
mentioned B I had a irrigation system to

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.029 
mentioned B I had a irrigation system to
my<00:00:18.080> greenhouse<00:00:18.380> oh<00:00:18.980> that<00:00:19.820> dirty<00:00:20.030> phone<00:00:20.480> calls

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
my greenhouse oh that dirty phone calls

my greenhouse oh that dirty phone calls
regarding<00:00:22.039> how<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:22.910> did<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:23.710> pardon<00:00:24.710> me<00:00:25.000> which

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
regarding how I did this pardon me which

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.730 
regarding how I did this pardon me which
I'm<00:00:26.119> quite<00:00:26.270> surprised<00:00:26.779> because<00:00:27.080> I<00:00:27.410> hardly

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
I'm quite surprised because I hardly

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.550 
I'm quite surprised because I hardly
thought<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.100> would<00:00:28.220> need<00:00:28.369> explanation<00:00:29.330> but<00:00:29.600> in

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
thought it would need explanation but in

inside<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.609> coil<00:01:07.850> was<00:01:08.029> a<00:01:08.060> little<00:01:08.359> plunger

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
inside the coil was a little plunger

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.669 
inside the coil was a little plunger

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
water to flow through so as long as the

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:30.039 
water to flow through so as long as the
coil<00:01:24.679> receives<00:01:26.740> AC<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.759> water<00:01:28.969> will<00:01:29.209> flow<00:01:29.389> and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
coil receives AC the water will flow and

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.999 
coil receives AC the water will flow and
as<00:01:30.709> soon<00:01:30.920> as<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.279> AC<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:32.060> removed<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:33.740> stops

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
as soon as the AC is removed it stops

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.609 
as soon as the AC is removed it stops
flowing<00:01:34.479> it's<00:01:35.479> very<00:01:35.749> very<00:01:35.990> simple

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
flowing it's very very simple

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.510 
flowing it's very very simple
they're<00:01:37.039> absolutely<00:01:37.189> bomb-proof<00:01:39.520> they're

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
they're absolutely bomb-proof they're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.300 
they're absolutely bomb-proof they're
used<00:01:40.729> up<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.270> direction<00:01:41.539> usually<00:01:42.380> they

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
used up in that direction usually they

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.639 
used up in that direction usually they
will<00:01:43.459> work<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.880> all<00:01:43.999> orientations<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
will work in all orientations but you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.379 
will work in all orientations but you
might<00:01:45.829> as<00:01:45.919> well<00:01:45.979> have<00:01:46.310> gravity<00:01:46.849> working<00:01:47.239> in

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
might as well have gravity working in

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:51.669 
might as well have gravity working in
your<00:01:47.539> favor<00:01:47.810> I've<00:01:49.719> pulled<00:01:50.719> out<00:01:50.899> hundreds<00:01:51.560> of

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
your favor I've pulled out hundreds of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.589 
your favor I've pulled out hundreds of
these<00:01:51.859> things<00:01:51.919> I've<00:01:52.520> very<00:01:52.789> rarely<00:01:52.880> found<00:01:53.359> any

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
these things I've very rarely found any

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.169 
these things I've very rarely found any
that<00:01:53.689> go<00:01:53.840> wrong<00:01:54.249> and<00:01:55.249> if<00:01:55.399> they<00:01:55.579> do<00:01:55.639> they'll

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
that go wrong and if they do they'll

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.510 
that go wrong and if they do they'll
have<00:01:56.359> an<00:01:56.450> open<00:01:56.689> circuit<00:01:57.169> coil<00:01:57.469> which<00:01:58.249> means

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
have an open circuit coil which means

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.429 
have an open circuit coil which means
the<00:01:58.669> water<00:01:58.880> won't<00:01:59.119> won't<00:01:59.659> flow<00:01:59.989> so<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.229> won't

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
the water won't won't flow so you won't

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.519 
the water won't won't flow so you won't
get<00:02:00.529> a<00:02:00.590> flood<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:01.849> their<00:02:02.569> work<00:02:02.809> their<00:02:03.079> work<00:02:03.319> at

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
get a flood and their work their work at

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.330 
get a flood and their work their work at
full<00:02:04.659> mains<00:02:05.659> water<00:02:05.989> pressure<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:07.130> fact

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
full mains water pressure in fact

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
full mains water pressure in fact
they'll<00:02:07.520> work<00:02:07.759> two<00:02:08.030> or<00:02:08.119> three<00:02:08.270> times<00:02:08.479> above

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
they'll work two or three times above

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.399 
they'll work two or three times above
that<00:02:09.080> quite<00:02:09.349> incredible<00:02:09.860> really<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:12.260> is

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
that quite incredible really so how is

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.020 
that quite incredible really so how is
an<00:02:12.500> irrigation<00:02:13.040> system<00:02:13.069> made<00:02:13.579> out<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.879> these

an irrigation system made out of these

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.990 
an irrigation system made out of these
well<00:02:14.360> very<00:02:14.569> very<00:02:14.810> simple

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
well very very simple

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.170 
well very very simple
sometimes<00:02:17.480> find<00:02:17.950> doubles<00:02:19.220> that's<00:02:19.730> where<00:02:19.940> hot
