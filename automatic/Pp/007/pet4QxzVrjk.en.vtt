00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.080
 yes people welcome to another 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.490
 small preview let's play this time he 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.490
 miss kids 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.930
 The whole thing will be sucker punch again 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.890
 developed developed 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.559
 like the predecessor the whole game 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.020
 seven years after the events 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:35.429
 infamous 2 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.769
 yes oh yes we have it a bit now 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.269
 need to explain story overly so 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.890
 I will not who the predecessor 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.469
 has gambled so infamous 2 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
 there are two ends that should 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.170
 now preferably a few seconds 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 skip infamous 2 is there 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.920
 now the two possibilities the good and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.289
 the bad end and the good end 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.760
 yes dies cool 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:07.229
 the main character I go of it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.869
 from that it took the end so that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.700
 they took the end because the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.320
 speech is that in any case two 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.390
 fractions fight each other and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.189
 then yes, these people are yes over 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.909
 powerful forces have like our good 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.170
 Lord of the lin just the main character 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.360
 as his 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.810
 I know then we do not care 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.369
 so not important and we will 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.880
 Of course, still as a bio terrorist 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.950
 and so on because they are 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.810
 are not normal as you can see here 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.229
 of course over powerful forces 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:50.220
 and there are no flashes in this one 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.119
 money in itself but more fire-like 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 explosive projectile or how to do it 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.450
 wants to take 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.580
 beautiful through the ventilation shaft and me 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.869
 must honestly say second sun is 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.649
 for me in any case top top 3 the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.950
 most expected next gen title of course 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.209
 logically again ps4 exclusive so 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.580
 which means but again sony exclusive 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.989
 say because the world of course to create 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.790
 little talk comes only fred perry 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.980
 do not go out in the boxhorn and I think that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.610
 Particle effects and pretty pretty 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.380
 hot 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.600
 On the controllable environment is set 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 partly very nice connections like 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.380
 one has seen 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.500
 he seems to be approaching him pretty much 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.709
 So to have this looks more like a 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.690
 when the predecessor was now publicly 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.180
 he hits his chain like that 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.650
 a bit as big as the towers 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.650
 you can bring it down again 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.069
 the good of what that was with him 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.439
 has why you have the powers and so 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.650
 further why the second sun means that 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.640
 you do not know 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.560
 i could feel that if you me 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.319
 Just look at it is a pure 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.969
 raw materials guess come then could 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.689
 perhaps with the risks to 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:20.430
 because when you look at the effects 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.620
 that reminds a bit of the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.939
 skin of babies if one is times 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.069
 Look closer may weld us 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.170
 already known the input knows that 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.560
 Not me, but it could be natural 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.510
 that he was that way then 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.060
 in between is pure 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.060
 by chance or so and therefore the forces 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.919
 We will do it throughout the network 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.900
 Of course, now it is only a small experience 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.169
 preview is let's play will be so soon 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.680
 start as soon as it gets that's it 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.510
 case in the first quarter of 2014 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.000
 special actions the same on the e3 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.700
 said something taken a little bit 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.319
 become 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.400
 maybe it also has it with ticks 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.400
 otherwise we will do it 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.239
 I'm not that way anymore 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.060
 a big fan of me completely about each 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.870
 play every detail now 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.070
 inform me because certain games are for me 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.620
 personally, you are sure to buy as well as 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.990
 this here is my out extremely well 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:33.850
 But the money is easy on this one 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:36.639
 overpowering forces looks saugeil 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:47.550
 apotek effect too and that was great 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:53.229
 cool from the west comes a bit 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:57.890
 I'm good over skater 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:01.110
 personally not if but of it 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.180
 Still, it seems to be so even if he does 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.530
 for me personally so from what you 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.730
 it has not seen any cabbage yet 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.380
 comes from the of the kind like him 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:16.950
 is now we see where there is little 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.080
 camera right now the end 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.400
 maike king a bit and everything 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.400
 broken around him 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.240
 even the soil taken harm 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.500
 it really looks really, really 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.540
 as I said one of my favorites 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.040
 So one of my favorites for the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.960
 nextgen consoles is internal second sun 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.020
 so what I have not said whether the 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.590
 whole plays in Seattle as small 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.120
 pension information and yes I am pleased 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.580
 I'm really really looking forward to it 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.870
 This game he looks like started 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.670
 even if I am here and there 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.830
 read some news but sony 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.300
 itself said the e3 that it 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.770
 Quarters in the coming quarter will be fine 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.850
 remains to be seen 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:09.390
 I think that's very, very nice again 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.080
 cool is beautiful open city no 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.120
 personnel 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.690
 he will not even begin 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.860
 hopefully not even remotely 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.620
 have shown what he has everything on it 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.360
 In the end, maybe he can 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.770
 later really to the buddy in phoenix 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.270
 transform as it just saw 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.220
 when he fell down or us 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.180
 will see as I said that let's play 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:34.350
 start as soon as there is first game outside 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.450
