00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
stalkers were not blinking in time so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.940 
stalkers were not blinking in time so
now<00:02:35.629> coming<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.440> they<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.769> start

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
now coming in are they going to start

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.619 
now coming in are they going to start
blinking<00:02:37.129> away<00:02:37.430> attack<00:02:38.269> socks<00:02:38.510> should

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
blinking away attack socks should

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.089 
blinking away attack socks should
probably<00:02:38.930> try<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.049> blink<00:02:39.440> away<00:02:39.680> low<00:02:40.069> and

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
probably try to blink away low and

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.650 
probably try to blink away low and
Hippolyta<00:02:40.430> middle<00:02:40.819> or<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.030> stalkers<00:02:41.480> but

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
Hippolyta middle or the stalkers but

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.759 
Hippolyta middle or the stalkers but
know<00:02:41.750> how<00:02:41.959> do<00:02:42.019> we<00:02:42.170> going<00:02:42.379> for<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.560> case

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
know how do we going for the case

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.220 
know how do we going for the case
instead<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.489> those<00:02:43.970> two<00:02:44.000> middle<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:44.720> very

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
instead and those two middle is very

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.229 
instead and those two middle is very
very<00:02:45.470> low<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:45.829> hip<00:02:46.040> points<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:47.030> looking

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
very low on hip points so it's looking

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.660 
very low on hip points so it's looking
as<00:02:47.540> though<00:02:47.569> attack<00:02:48.019> socks<00:02:48.379> is<00:02:48.590> in<00:02:49.129> a<00:02:49.250> much<00:02:49.489> much

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
as though attack socks is in a much much

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.759 
as though attack socks is in a much much
better<00:02:49.910> position<00:02:50.180> middle<00:02:51.049> is<00:02:51.170> coming<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.650> to

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
better position middle is coming in to

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.589 
better position middle is coming in to
join<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.190> at<00:02:52.700> least<00:02:52.819> try<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.060> take<00:02:53.329> down<00:02:53.360> this

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
join in at least try to take down this

well<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.299> think<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.870> going<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.049> be<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
well but I think that is going to be a

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
sock and i guess i guess i would say i

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.270

would<00:04:12.420> call<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.110> game<00:04:13.440> more<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:14.069> an

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
would call this game more of an

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.390 
would call this game more of an
asian-style<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:15.269> play<00:04:15.480> where<00:04:15.780> he<00:04:15.989> went<00:04:16.799> for<00:04:17.100> a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
blink ability and yeah that was that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.670 
blink ability and yeah that was that
early<00:04:24.990> blink<00:04:25.290> was<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:26.160> crucial<00:04:26.699> able<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
early blink was just so crucial able to

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.040 
early blink was just so crucial able to
position<00:04:28.680> yourself<00:04:29.280> able<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.030> also<00:04:30.240> blink<00:04:30.810> off

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
position yourself able to also blink off

position yourself able to also blink off
onto<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.560> high<00:04:31.770> ground<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:32.280> blink

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
onto that high ground and then blink

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.969 
onto that high ground and then blink
back<00:04:32.850> down<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.690> was<00:04:33.900> just<00:04:34.080> absolutely

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
back down that was just absolutely

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.820 
back down that was just absolutely
absolutely<00:04:35.790> beautiful<00:04:36.330> play<00:04:36.600> coming<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.590> from

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
absolutely beautiful play coming in from

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
attack socks using using that bling and

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.340 
attack socks using using that bling and

dark high templars he had the dark
shrine<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.870> don't<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:46.740> he<00:04:46.830> ever<00:04:46.970> produced<00:04:47.970> a

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
shrine I don't think he ever produced a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.150 
shrine I don't think he ever produced a
single<00:04:48.389> Dark<00:04:48.750> Templar<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.590> option<00:04:49.770> was

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
single Dark Templar but the option was

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.000 
single Dark Templar but the option was
there<00:04:50.430> he<00:04:50.850> also<00:04:51.090> went<00:04:51.600> for<00:04:52.200> Colossus<00:04:52.590> with

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
there he also went for Colossus with

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.460 
there he also went for Colossus with
that<00:04:53.130> robotics<00:04:53.639> pay<00:04:53.850> also<00:04:54.600> had<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.960> extended

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
that robotics pay also had the extended

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.230 
that robotics pay also had the extended
thermal<00:04:55.740> Lance<00:04:55.979> range<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.030> was<00:04:57.180> very

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
thermal Lance range so it was very

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.439 
thermal Lance range so it was very
difficult<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.320> zelaya<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.070> really<00:04:59.449> amount

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
difficult for a zelaya to really amount

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.379 
difficult for a zelaya to really amount
up<00:05:00.690> any<00:05:00.930> real<00:05:01.530> proper<00:05:02.039> counter-attack<00:05:02.639> really

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
up any real proper counter-attack really

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.240 
up any real proper counter-attack really
nice<00:05:03.690> unit<00:05:04.110> combinations<00:05:04.650> really<00:05:05.039> nice

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
nice unit combinations really nice

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.580 
nice unit combinations really nice
balance<00:05:05.520> had<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.630> weapons<00:05:06.960> upgrades<00:05:07.410> and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
balance had the weapons upgrades and

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.650 
balance had the weapons upgrades and
that's<00:05:08.039> really<00:05:08.310> what<00:05:08.550> gave<00:05:08.760> attack<00:05:09.060> socks<00:05:09.419> and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
that's really what gave attack socks and

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.900 
that's really what gave attack socks and
such<00:05:10.289> a<00:05:10.320> strong<00:05:11.039> game<00:05:11.400> this<00:05:11.610> whole<00:05:11.789> entire

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
such a strong game this whole entire

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.930 
such a strong game this whole entire
time<00:05:12.710> also<00:05:13.710> an<00:05:13.979> as<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.220> way<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.490> making<00:05:14.850> that

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
time also an as a way of making that

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.300 
time also an as a way of making that
mistakes<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.539> committing<00:05:16.169> zerglings<00:05:17.099> and

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
mistakes and committing zerglings and

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.150 
mistakes and committing zerglings and
mutinous<00:05:17.750> essentially<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.830> think<00:05:20.039> that

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
mutinous essentially and I think that

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.260 
mutinous essentially and I think that
just<00:05:20.190> probably<00:05:20.550> around<00:05:20.820> what<00:05:21.030> three

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
just probably around what three

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.240 
just probably around what three
medalists<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.960> dozen<00:05:22.410> zerglings<00:05:22.889> data<00:05:23.070> but

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
medalists and a dozen zerglings data but

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.820 
medalists and a dozen zerglings data but
that's<00:05:23.370> about<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.580> 900<00:05:24.389> oh<00:05:24.539> yeah<00:05:24.990> that's<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.229> 900

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
that's about a 900 oh yeah that's a 900

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.430 
that's about a 900 oh yeah that's a 900
mineral<00:05:26.220> army<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.419> take<00:05:27.630> down<00:05:27.840> one<00:05:28.139> pile

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
mineral army just to take down one pile

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.339 
mineral army just to take down one pile
on<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:29.099> one<00:05:29.340> pile<00:05:29.580> on<00:05:29.789> not<00:05:30.720> really<00:05:31.020> worth<00:05:31.200> it

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
on that one pile on not really worth it

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.070 
on that one pile on not really worth it
and<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.800> really<00:05:32.520> attack<00:05:33.180> socks<00:05:33.450> capitalized

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
and and really attack socks capitalized

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.409 
and and really attack socks capitalized
with<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:34.950> with<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.250> army<00:05:35.639> being<00:05:35.820> split<00:05:36.210> up

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
with that with that army being split up

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.210 
with that with that army being split up
by<00:05:36.750> attacking<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.200> main<00:05:37.470> base<00:05:37.680> taking<00:05:37.979> down

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
by attacking the main base taking down

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.650 
by attacking the main base taking down
that<00:05:38.340> high<00:05:38.520> yield<00:05:38.760> mineral<00:05:39.060> expansion<00:05:39.479> and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
that high yield mineral expansion and

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.659 
that high yield mineral expansion and
then<00:05:40.080> taking<00:05:40.440> down<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.889> high<00:05:41.639> ground

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
then taking down this high ground

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.850 
then taking down this high ground
expansion<00:05:42.479> natural<00:05:43.080> expansion<00:05:43.289> over<00:05:43.680> here

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
expansion natural expansion over here
