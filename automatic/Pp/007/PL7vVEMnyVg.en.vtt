00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:57.580
 so what happened 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.580
 I thought it would give me time to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:10.149
 get on the river bird is like this and I called 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.149
 The adulterer's flame radius is 105 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.680

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.930

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.300
