00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.779
 hello everyone with you dakota and you look 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.209
 first edition of a series of helpful tips 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.980
 which I will talk about non-obvious 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.160
 ways to use abilities and 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 the talents of the heroes as well as their 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.210
 undocumented features and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.340
 let's start from comrades zeratul this 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.900
 the hero most often can be seen selected 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.510
 at the tenth level, the ultimatum 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.490
 ability to bond an emptiness which 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.270
 allows you to trap opponents 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.449
 for 5 seconds 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.489
 turning them off from the battle on the hero this 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.679
 ability does not work and this can 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.019
 use to take away from enemies 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.019
 mercenaries whom they have such difficulty 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.420
 collected the fact that when you activate us 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.210
 hero voids trapped 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.859
 virtually disappear from the card so 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.960
 even being in the circle of capture 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.210
 formally they do not capture 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.039
 therefore activating the ultu in the center 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.710
 camp u fast and easy 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.559
 turn off all nearby rivals 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.569
 and 5 seconds of action ults will be more 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.320
 what is enough to have time to pick up 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:07.240
 camp and leave with head held high 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.360
 by the way bonds of emptiness can be hung on any 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.689
 the building even the citadel rescuing them from any 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.340
 incoming damage except perhaps 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.369
 shots of blackberry on the same name 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.829
 map tassadar is another hero with 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.560
 undocumented capabilities of their 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.509
 spatial shift abilities gives 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.670
 heroes are not only useful in battle escape 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.130
 letting you go into stealth stop 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.109
 take damage but in this condition 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.630
 tassadar can pass through the heroes and 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.460
 warriors and also if enemy or 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.920
 neutral golem seized its power 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.130
 tenacious paws activating this ability 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.719
 you easily get out of captivity favor 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.060
 spatial shift difficult 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.700
 reevaluate when you have a new focus 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.070
 with your triple shot one click on 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.820
 key and the enemy is left in vain 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.470
 spent by the ulta 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.119
 the same applies to all directed 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.729
 abilities of other heroes 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.340
 for example top exactly taykus and or 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.259
 the best death of azmodan 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 without going far from talking about nova 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.610
 some heroes have ice talent 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 lump it take infrequently 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.080
 preferring more useful 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.569
 alternatives but in a triple situation 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.410
 shot but you are especially for heal heroes 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.900
 support he can save a life 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.090
 talent stitch skewers selectable at 16 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.130
 level allows not only to attract 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.900
 up to two enemy characters for 1 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.230
 but the hook also gains the ability 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.150
 pass through the enemy gate another 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.709
 deal that to the sixteenth level gate 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.080
 opponents are not so much 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.110
 to apply this lance benefit and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.730
 often enough but at the end I want 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.489
 tell about hotkeys 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.140
 first of all, and the shift buttons when 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.300
 using this key you can put 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.970
 Team to give character to the queue 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.100
 for example you sagged on mana and health and 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.530
 need to run up to sip from the well 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.480
 right click on the well a 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.180
 then through shift in the place where 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.739
 want to be with you 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.840
 thin green lines 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.450
 marked trajectories planned 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.670
 moving your hero in this way 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.030
 you minimize time loss 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.579
 on routine displacements more vital 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.769
 the situation is catching you up the enemy but 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.870
 the distance between you is enough to 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.109
 try to ride a horse and ride 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 sunset press z and then shift 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.150
 the right button indicates the direction 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.040
 movements your hero immediately as he sits on 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.489
 the horse will move to the indicated 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.530
 point giving orders manually you would 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.290
 lost a few fractions of a second 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.090
 that could cost you your life in 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.100
 queue can be put at once several 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.950
 teams for example you came to take 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.470
 doubloons on the map bay until Blackheart 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.780
 the hero captivates the pirate again through 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.600
 shift press z and click on 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.700
 the next goal on the map is your hero right away 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.310
 after putting the coins will ride a horse 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.440
 go travel it all 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.780
 allow you to save time what's 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.569
 conditions of short-term matches entry can 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.370
 be very critical last tip 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.379
 also concern management 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.790
 about those players who were not close 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.650
 familiar with the moba genre 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.340
 by want to improve your game level 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.239
 reducing the number of mouse clicks 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.329
 game settings in the management section 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.340
 you can find a quick point 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.139
 the inclusion of which will allow you 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.060
 automatically apply selected 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.370
 ability in the place where you have 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.810
 the mouse cursor is located at the moment of clicking 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.600
 hot key 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.340
 it saves time but 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.830
 will require some getting used to 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.380
 also keep in mind that you will stop seeing 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
 range of ability that can 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.669
 lead to its waste 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.010
 but in general, the setting allows much 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.400
 save time especially much 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.070
 button heroes on this batch of tips 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.050
 come to an end if you have a supplement 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.300
 or refinement leave them in 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.460
 comments remember that many 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.070
 recorded ability can be with 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.070
 time changed by developers and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.460
 this I say goodbye to you successful battles and to 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.460
 see you soon
