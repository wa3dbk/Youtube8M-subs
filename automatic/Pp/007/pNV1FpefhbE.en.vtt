00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
correctly now the ages 1 and then also

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.240 
correctly now the ages 1 and then also
how<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.609> lose<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.239> weight<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.750> how<00:02:57.530> fast<00:02:57.919> or

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
slow you lose the weight is the other

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.950 
slow you lose the weight is the other
right<00:03:00.280> now<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.060> do<00:03:01.270> if<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.630> undergo

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
right now if you do if you undergo

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.640 
right now if you do if you undergo
surgery<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:03.610> gastric<00:03:04.150> bypass<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.870> bariatric

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
surgery like gastric bypass or bariatric

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.960

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
surgery where you're gonna lose the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.060 
surgery where you're gonna lose the
weight<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.420> one<00:03:07.810> year<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.290> might<00:03:08.470> lose<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> lot

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
weight in one year you might lose a lot

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.340 
weight in one year you might lose a lot
of<00:03:09.100> weight<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:10.390> didn't<00:03:10.630> have<00:03:10.750> enough<00:03:11.080> time

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
of weight so you didn't have enough time

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.460 
of weight so you didn't have enough time
for<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.830> skin<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.220> recall<00:03:12.640> then<00:03:13.240> yes<00:03:13.540> this

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
for the skin to recall then yes this

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.650 
for the skin to recall then yes this
would<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.830> more<00:03:15.100> factor<00:03:15.520> where<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.480> other

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
would be a more factor where the other

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.380 
would be a more factor where the other
ones<00:03:16.870> will<00:03:17.050> do<00:03:17.290> say<00:03:17.770> diet<00:03:18.460> and<00:03:18.730> exercise<00:03:19.180> which

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
ones will do say diet and exercise which

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.660 
ones will do say diet and exercise which
takes<00:03:19.780> much<00:03:20.470> longer<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:21.070> might<00:03:21.190> takes<00:03:21.460> two

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
takes much longer it might takes two

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.370 
takes much longer it might takes two
three<00:03:21.910> years<00:03:22.150> right<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.900> lose<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.170> same

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
three years right to lose the same

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.480 
three years right to lose the same
amount<00:03:23.410> what<00:03:23.890> you're<00:03:24.010> gonna<00:03:24.100> lose<00:03:24.310> them

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
amount what you're gonna lose them

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.730 
amount what you're gonna lose them
within<00:03:25.150> six<00:03:25.510> or<00:03:25.660> eight<00:03:25.840> month<00:03:26.110> by<00:03:26.290> doing<00:03:26.680> a

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
within six or eight month by doing a

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.100 
within six or eight month by doing a
surgery<00:03:27.160> then<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.090> one's<00:03:28.360> less<00:03:28.720> likely<00:03:29.050> to

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
surgery then this one's less likely to

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.500 
surgery then this one's less likely to
have<00:03:29.350> saggy<00:03:30.100> skin<00:03:30.430> as<00:03:30.610> well<00:03:31.120> as<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.390> age

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
have saggy skin as well as the age

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.680 
have saggy skin as well as the age
correctly<00:03:32.230> we<00:03:32.800> see<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.220> age<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:34.150> let's<00:03:34.540> say

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
correctly we see the age like let's say

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.130 
correctly we see the age like let's say
somebody<00:03:35.230> below<00:03:35.590> 40<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.280> somebody<00:03:37.180> above<00:03:37.660> 50

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
somebody below 40 and somebody above 50

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.770 
somebody below 40 and somebody above 50
this<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.070> different<00:03:39.550> when<00:03:39.730> they<00:03:39.910> see<00:03:39.970> below

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
this is a different when they see below

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.560 
this is a different when they see below
40<00:03:41.140> they<00:03:41.380> have<00:03:41.560> better<00:03:42.220> skin<00:03:43.060> quality<00:03:43.510> of

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.480 
40 they have better skin quality of
attraction<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.709> course<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.160> it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
attraction and of course if this it

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.780 
attraction and of course if this it
matters<00:03:46.060> also<00:03:46.209> how<00:03:46.560> obese<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.430> client

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
matters also how obese the the client

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.020 
matters also how obese the the client
was<00:03:48.970> before<00:03:49.450> yes<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.050> how<00:03:50.170> much<00:03:50.320> they<00:03:50.470> lost

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
was before yes and how much they lost

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.670 
was before yes and how much they lost
