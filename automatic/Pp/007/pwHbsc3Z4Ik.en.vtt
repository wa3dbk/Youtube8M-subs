00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
changed his class to write show so I

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.949 
changed his class to write show so I
hopped<00:02:58.609> in<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.849> custom<00:02:59.239> game<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.660> give<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.840> a

hopped in a custom game and give it a

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.569 
hopped in a custom game and give it a
try<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.530> yep<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.849> works<00:03:02.260> super<00:03:03.260> easy<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:04.459> you
