00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.250 
to give him a clear motivation for why
he<00:03:21.580> needs<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.570> go<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:22.960> really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
he needs to to go on this really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.380 
he needs to to go on this really
