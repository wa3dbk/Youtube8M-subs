00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
I'm plugging for a second without

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.839 
I'm plugging for a second without
letting<00:00:10.679> these<00:00:10.800> two<00:00:11.070> touch<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.639> ground

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
letting these two touch and ground

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.200 
letting these two touch and ground
anything<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.500> these<00:00:13.500> are<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.009> Mirage<00:00:14.370> nano

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
anything out these are the Mirage nano

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.750 
anything out these are the Mirage nano
stats<00:00:15.599> these<00:00:15.990> are<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> older<00:00:16.500> ones<00:00:16.710> there's<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
stats these are the older ones there's a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.480 
stats these are the older ones there's a
newer<00:00:18.060> one<00:00:18.270> down<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:20.010> roommate<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
newer one down here that my roommate is

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.790 
newer one down here that my roommate is
using<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> Center<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:25.410> floor<00:00:25.650> it's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
using for a Center and the floor it's

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.240 
using for a Center and the floor it's
fine

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
fine

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.450 
fine
anything<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.710> they're<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.920> weird<00:00:29.279> looking

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
anything and they're very weird looking

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.339 
anything and they're very weird looking
and<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.269> reason<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.810> we're<00:00:31.019> looking<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and the reason that we're looking is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.120 
and the reason that we're looking is
because<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> driver<00:00:32.059> is<00:00:33.500> angle<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.920> way

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
because a driver is angle of of that way

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.680 
because a driver is angle of of that way
and<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> tweeters<00:00:36.420> hang<00:00:36.600> up

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and actually the tweeters hang up

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.319 
and actually the tweeters hang up
straight<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.579> purpose<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
straight up and the purpose of the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
straight up and the purpose of the
Mirage<00:00:39.950> series<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.100> speakers<00:00:41.489> their<00:00:41.730> whole

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
Mirage series of speakers their whole

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.380 
Mirage series of speakers their whole
line<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.710> use<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.129> dome<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:45.239> this

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
line is that they use a dome like this

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
line is that they use a dome like this
is<00:00:45.510> dome<00:00:45.690> their<00:00:45.960> dome<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:47.280> shoot

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
is dome their dome here and they shoot

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459 
is dome their dome here and they shoot
the<00:00:47.670> sound<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> dome<00:00:48.809> reflects<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the sound up and the dome reflects it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.830 
the sound up and the dome reflects it
forward<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.510> all

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
forward and out like this in all

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.189 
forward and out like this in all
directions<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.059> that's<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.239> very<00:00:54.449> novel<00:00:54.719> idea

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
directions and that's a very novel idea

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
directions and that's a very novel idea
that's<00:00:55.469> similar<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> using<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> bipolar

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that's similar to using like a bipolar

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
that's similar to using like a bipolar
speaker<00:00:58.260> where<00:00:58.440> toots<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:58.859> directions

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
speaker where toots in two directions

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
speaker where toots in two directions
and<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.899> benefit<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and the benefit of that is you get a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.539 
and the benefit of that is you get a
much<00:01:04.680> broader<00:01:05.519> sound<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.080> just

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
much broader sound then if you have just

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.760 
much broader sound then if you have just
boom<00:01:08.840> focused<00:01:09.840> speaker<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:12.260> does<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.290> work

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
boom focused speaker now does it work

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
boom focused speaker now does it work
yes<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.180> work<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.659> cell<00:01:15.930> towers<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
yes it does work they cell towers that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
yes it does work they cell towers that
are<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> tall<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.280> an<00:01:17.670> arrangement

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
are this tall and have an arrangement

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
are this tall and have an arrangement
like<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.900> top<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.409> bigger<00:01:19.680> driver<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like this on top much bigger driver and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.120 
like this on top much bigger driver and
a<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.640> nicer<00:01:20.850> tweeter<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.350> still

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
a much nicer tweeter but these still

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.929 
a much nicer tweeter but these still
work<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:24.560> now<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.890> were<00:01:25.950> currently

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
work really well now they were currently

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.870 
work really well now they were currently
and<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.720> been<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.040> his<00:01:29.460> rear

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and have been in use as his rear

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.080 
and have been in use as his rear
channels<00:01:30.500> because<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.090> swing

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
channels because they have this swing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.960 
channels because they have this swing
arm<00:01:33.329> screw<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.070> either<00:01:35.850> mount

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
arm screw down that you can either mount

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810 
arm screw down that you can either mount
this<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> wall<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.960> pivot<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.520> sell

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this to the wall and pivot or they sell

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
this to the wall and pivot or they sell
brackets<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.479> I'll<00:01:39.750> try<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> find<00:01:40.170> this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
brackets like this I'll try to find this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
brackets like this I'll try to find this
bracket<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.159> sell<00:01:41.520> this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
bracket I'm not sure if they sell this

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.240 
bracket I'm not sure if they sell this
style<00:01:42.090> anymore<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> rail<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.009> put

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
style anymore with the rail and just put

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
style anymore with the rail and just put
the<00:01:44.369> thing<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> rail<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> twist<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the thing on the rail and you twist it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
the thing on the rail and you twist it
and<00:01:46.740> sits<00:01:46.920> down<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.399> great<00:01:47.659> for<00:01:48.659> rear

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and sits down there it's great for rear

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.710 
and sits down there it's great for rear
channels<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.640> amazingly<00:01:51.420> good

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
channels these are amazingly good

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
channels these are amazingly good
especially<00:01:52.530> we're<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:53.009> stands<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:55.969> if

these<00:02:12.090> nano<00:02:12.420> stats<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.989> them<00:02:13.170> that's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
these nano stats on them that's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.300 
these nano stats on them that's
here<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.330> broadcast<00:02:15.330> sound<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:17.010> general

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
here and broadcast sound in the general

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.030 
here and broadcast sound in the general
direction<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.180> left<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:19.040> they

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
direction of right and left and they

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.370 
direction of right and left and they
work<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.300> really<00:02:21.600> well<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
work really really really well and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.020 
work really really really well and
they're<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:23.010> really<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.790> expensive

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
they're really really really expensive

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.340 
they're really really really expensive
for<00:02:24.569> what<00:02:24.720> they<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:26.780> think<00:02:27.780> they're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
for what they are but I think they're

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.780 
for what they are but I think they're
worth<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:28.980> was<00:02:29.160> playing<00:02:29.459> around<00:02:29.580> with

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
worth it now I was playing around with

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.210 
worth it now I was playing around with
them<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.530> fronts<00:02:32.250> main<00:02:32.489> channels<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
them here as fronts main channels and I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.979 
them here as fronts main channels and I
may<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.520> get<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> new<00:02:39.270> task<00:02:39.480> amount<00:02:39.870> into

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
may have to get the new task amount into

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.800 
may have to get the new task amount into
a<00:02:40.020> recording<00:02:40.440> video<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:41.610> uh<00:02:41.640> as<00:02:42.090> main

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
a recording video but uh as main

I<00:02:46.200> ran<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> uh<00:02:46.940> assigned<00:02:47.940> sweep<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.810> know

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
I ran a uh assigned sweep that you know

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.990 
I ran a uh assigned sweep that you know
tells<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.380> how<00:02:49.530> sixty<00:02:50.340> Hertz<00:02:50.430> seven-year

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
tells you how sixty Hertz seven-year

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.540 
tells you how sixty Hertz seven-year
it's<00:02:51.150> eighty<00:02:51.330> six<00:02:51.540> hundred<00:02:51.870> Hertz<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.550> where

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
it's eighty six hundred Hertz and where

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.000 
it's eighty six hundred Hertz and where
these<00:02:53.760> started<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.239> come<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.720> was<00:02:54.959> about<00:02:55.110> 120

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
these started to come in was about 120

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.750 
these started to come in was about 120
to<00:02:56.100> 130<00:02:56.790> Hertz<00:02:57.180> which<00:02:58.050> means<00:02:58.190> subwoofer<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.550> in

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
to 130 Hertz which means subwoofer or in

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.600 
to 130 Hertz which means subwoofer or in
this<00:02:59.850> case<00:03:00.620> some<00:03:01.620> wilfers<00:03:03.380> have<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:05.160> put<00:03:05.430> out<00:03:05.580> a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
this case some wilfers have to put out a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.320 
this case some wilfers have to put out a
hundred<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.239> thirty<00:03:06.450> Hertz<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.700> below<00:03:08.700> which

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
hundred and thirty Hertz and below which

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.440 
hundred and thirty Hertz and below which
is<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.870> high<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.410> subwoofer<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.450> these

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
is really high for a subwoofer so these

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.229 
is really high for a subwoofer so these
aren't<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.170> best<00:03:13.500> use<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.819> these<00:03:14.910> because

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
aren't the best use for these because

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.080 
aren't the best use for these because
that's<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.510> lot<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:16.019> frequency<00:03:16.530> missing<00:03:17.090> but

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
that's a lot of frequency missing but

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.310 
that's a lot of frequency missing but
when<00:03:18.660> you're<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> surround<00:03:19.230> sound

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
when you're in a surround sound

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.900 
when you're in a surround sound
environment<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.370> set<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.700> rears

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
environment and you just set the rears

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.340 
environment and you just set the rears
to<00:03:21.180> 130<00:03:21.900> crossover<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:23.280> doesn't<00:03:23.640> matter

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
to 130 crossover that doesn't matter

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.720 
to 130 crossover that doesn't matter
you're<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:25.500> gonna<00:03:25.620> hear<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.040> fax<00:03:26.340> back<00:03:26.579> there

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
you're just gonna hear it fax back there

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.170 
you're just gonna hear it fax back there
anyway

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
anyway

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.650 
anyway
and<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:28.590> effects<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.220> sound<00:03:29.579> really<00:03:30.390> really

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
and the effects do sound really really

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.350 
and the effects do sound really really
good<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:32.250> everywhere<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.620> I'm<00:03:34.620> gonna<00:03:35.360> I'm

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
good just everywhere and I'm gonna I'm

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.390 
good just everywhere and I'm gonna I'm
gonna<00:03:36.450> say<00:03:36.660> they're<00:03:36.810> well-built<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.920> grills

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
gonna say they're well-built the grills

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.759 
gonna say they're well-built the grills
these<00:03:38.670> new<00:03:38.850> grills<00:03:39.090> are<00:03:39.390> much<00:03:39.600> nicer<00:03:39.810> these

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
these new grills are much nicer these

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.170 
these new grills are much nicer these
are<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:40.980> open<00:03:41.220> mesh<00:03:41.400> grilles<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.910> these<00:03:42.000> are

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
are the open mesh grilles and these are

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.840 
are the open mesh grilles and these are
a<00:03:42.209> much<00:03:42.540> actually<00:03:42.870> tighter<00:03:43.079> mesh<00:03:43.820> with<00:03:44.820> a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
a much actually tighter mesh with a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.690 
a much actually tighter mesh with a
cover<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.299> washy<00:03:45.510> fit<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.519> or<00:03:47.519> you

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.490 
bathroom or these and I'm not actually
sure<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.609> price<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.910> hundred<00:04:21.419> percent<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.380> I'm

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
sure the price a hundred percent so I'm

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.570 
sure the price a hundred percent so I'm
not<00:04:22.620> going<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.830> say<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.190> video<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.550> can

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
not going to say to the video you can

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.370 
not going to say to the video you can
check<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.909> link<00:04:24.090> but<00:04:24.990> I'm<00:04:25.080> pretty<00:04:25.289> sure

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
check the link but I'm pretty sure

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.760 
check the link but I'm pretty sure
they're<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.159> up<00:04:26.310> there

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
they're there up there

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.950 
they're there up there

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
like the $80 100 piece range not sure

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.300 
like the $80 100 piece range not sure
not<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.289> hard<00:04:32.470> wasn't<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.800> are<00:04:32.860> pretty<00:04:33.160> sure

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
not a hard wasn't you are pretty sure

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.689 
not a hard wasn't you are pretty sure
you<00:04:33.759> know<00:04:33.849> 50-50<00:04:34.419> chance<00:04:34.449> I'm<00:04:34.780> right<00:04:34.979> but<00:04:35.979> for

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
you know 50-50 chance I'm right but for

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.219 
you know 50-50 chance I'm right but for
how<00:04:36.789> well<00:04:37.000> they're<00:04:37.180> built<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.629> for<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.050> they

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
how well they're built and for what they

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.379 
how well they're built and for what they
can<00:04:38.409> do<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.650> sound<00:04:38.889> what<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.240> exists<00:04:40.240> off

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
can do to sound what the exists off

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.059 
can do to sound what the exists off
their<00:04:41.879> fairy<00:04:42.879> dust<00:04:43.319> they<00:04:44.319> really<00:04:44.650> do<00:04:44.800> work

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
their fairy dust they really do work

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.379 
their fairy dust they really do work
well<00:04:45.340> for<00:04:45.580> rear<00:04:45.759> channels<00:04:46.060> now<00:04:46.150> what<00:04:46.300> I'm

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
well for rear channels now what I'm

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.580 
well for rear channels now what I'm
going<00:04:46.569> to<00:04:46.659> attempt<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.900> do<00:04:47.080> while<00:04:47.319> they're<00:04:47.470> up

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
going to attempt to do while they're up

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.980 
going to attempt to do while they're up
here<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:48.120> I'm<00:04:49.120> gonna<00:04:49.240> run<00:04:49.419> another<00:04:49.599> set<00:04:49.900> of

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
here is I'm gonna run another set of

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.200 
here is I'm gonna run another set of
wires<00:04:50.199> from<00:04:50.500> might<00:04:50.710> ask<00:04:50.919> em<00:04:51.159> out<00:04:51.340> because<00:04:51.909> this

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
wires from might ask em out because this

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.719 
wires from might ask em out because this
receiver<00:04:52.599> supports<00:04:53.050> front<00:04:53.349> height<00:04:53.710> let's<00:04:54.669> do

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
receiver supports front height let's do

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.089 
receiver supports front height let's do
a<00:04:54.819> 5.1<00:04:55.449> and<00:04:55.840> instead<00:04:56.199> of<00:04:56.289> surround<00:04:56.889> back

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
a 5.1 and instead of surround back

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.490 
a 5.1 and instead of surround back
channels<00:04:57.520> it'll<00:04:58.180> do<00:04:58.330> front<00:04:58.750> height<00:04:59.169> channels

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
channels it'll do front height channels

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.529 
channels it'll do front height channels
and<00:04:59.919> I<00:05:00.550> wouldn't<00:05:00.819> have<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.030> put<00:05:01.180> them<00:05:01.360> up

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
and I wouldn't have to put them up

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.740 
and I wouldn't have to put them up
because<00:05:01.990> these<00:05:02.380> are<00:05:03.090> omnidirectional<00:05:04.090> top

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
because these are omnidirectional top

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.740 
because these are omnidirectional top
firing<00:05:05.259> speakers<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.669> I<00:05:06.699> want<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.270> see<00:05:07.419> what

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
firing speakers so I want to see what

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.390 
firing speakers so I want to see what
exactly<00:05:07.900> front<00:05:08.590> height<00:05:08.740> does<00:05:08.949> I've<00:05:09.130> never<00:05:09.280> to

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
exactly front height does I've never to

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.850 
exactly front height does I've never to
actually<00:05:09.669> play<00:05:09.819> with<00:05:09.849> that<00:05:10.120> particular

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
actually play with that particular

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.050 
actually play with that particular
arrangement<00:05:11.860> I'm<00:05:12.400> sure<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.699> could<00:05:12.789> fake

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
arrangement I'm sure it could fake

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.460 
arrangement I'm sure it could fake
whatever<00:05:13.539> I<00:05:13.599> need<00:05:13.780> your<00:05:13.960> front<00:05:14.169> height<00:05:14.289> isn't

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
whatever I need your front height isn't

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.529 
whatever I need your front height isn't
an<00:05:14.620> actual<00:05:14.889> legitimate<00:05:15.300> surround<00:05:16.300> sound

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
an actual legitimate surround sound

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.689 
an actual legitimate surround sound
channel<00:05:16.840> so<00:05:17.440> I'm<00:05:17.500> gonna<00:05:17.620> have<00:05:17.949> it<00:05:18.069> fake<00:05:18.400> front

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
channel so I'm gonna have it fake front

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:19.830 
channel so I'm gonna have it fake front
height<00:05:18.909> and<00:05:19.060> I'll<00:05:19.120> see<00:05:19.300> what<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.539> sounds

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
height and I'll see what that sounds

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.290 
height and I'll see what that sounds
like<00:05:20.020> too<00:05:20.460> but<00:05:21.460> who<00:05:21.610> knows<00:05:21.759> maybe<00:05:21.909> it'll<00:05:22.210> open

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
like too but who knows maybe it'll open

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.029 
like too but who knows maybe it'll open
up<00:05:22.509> a<00:05:22.630> whole<00:05:22.870> new<00:05:22.900> world<00:05:23.259> and<00:05:23.650> at<00:05:23.710> most<00:05:23.889> would

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
up a whole new world and at most would

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.890 
up a whole new world and at most would
even<00:05:24.250> be<00:05:24.340> needed<00:05:25.889> but<00:05:26.889> yeah<00:05:27.099> yeah<00:05:27.969> compared<00:05:28.840> to

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
even be needed but yeah yeah compared to

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.899 
even be needed but yeah yeah compared to
a<00:05:28.960> real<00:05:29.169> speaker<00:05:29.590> wouldn't<00:05:30.430> use<00:05:30.550> these<00:05:30.699> for

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
a real speaker wouldn't use these for

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.990 
a real speaker wouldn't use these for
music<00:05:31.240> but<00:05:31.479> they<00:05:31.630> do<00:05:31.690> function<00:05:32.620> or<00:05:33.610> about<00:05:33.880> to

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
music but they do function or about to

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.920 
music but they do function or about to
hear<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.270> I'm<00:05:34.389> gonna<00:05:34.509> sound<00:05:35.199> demo<00:05:35.500> video<00:05:35.830> is
