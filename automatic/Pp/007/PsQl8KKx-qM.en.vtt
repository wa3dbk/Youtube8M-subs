and I think we try to get the best
players<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:43.930> we<00:00:43.990> put<00:00:44.170> them<00:00:44.260> together<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.860> we

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
players and we put them together and we

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.650 
train them together and we put top
coaches<00:00:47.440> with<00:00:47.590> them<00:00:47.770> so<00:00:48.310> that<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:49.330> players

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
coaches with them so that the players

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.560 
coaches with them so that the players
are<00:00:49.990> demanded<00:00:50.650> of<00:00:50.800> at<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.670> certain<00:00:51.940> level<00:00:52.210> and
