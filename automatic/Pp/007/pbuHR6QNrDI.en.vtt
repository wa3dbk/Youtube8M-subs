 hardest modelcontest of the planet 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.330
 hundreds of applications from all over 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.920
 Germany between 20 and 30 years 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 faced the challenges of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 photographer and organizer martin häners 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
 to be at the center of his work 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 travel and underwater shots that is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.570
 without an exchange 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.130
 schiester girl 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.840
 we see young women made it to the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.580
 semifinals to egypt where you are at 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.320
 numerous shootings over and under 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.800
 water prove your talent 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.020
 could 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.119
 four girls are now on their way 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.970
 Thailand here will show who 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.620
 really the stuff to star girl 2014 has 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.750
 who brings that proportion with it 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.210
 and it also looks good that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.890
 the perfect mix of support 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.070
 he receives the rating from milena 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.690
 the acting pull ag with her 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.080
 experience she will be the girls with advice 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.890
 and did stand aside and that is 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.440
 our finalist semra sabrina natascha 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:03.949
 and Elizabeth are ready only the biggest 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.239
 experienced adventure because I think 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.070
 simply that's really the hottest 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.690
 contest wants to model 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.350
 I would like to have fotoshootings here 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.119
 to travel 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.000
 I have this dream now and that's why 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.450
 I also want to live the now looks as 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 last chance 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.359
 The journey begins at Frankfurter 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.189
 airport after a quick check inn 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:46.740
 city girls are in a good mood and have fun 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:49.770
 was very curious though night 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.270
 disappears without eating no fear 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.209
 natasha nobody has to starve here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.289
 But now ball is in the plane 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.390
 thai airways and the thai 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.670
 tourist office are longtime 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.679
 Cooperation partner of easter discovery 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.679
 and kindly makes the wings 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.179
 planet's largest passenger airplane 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.859
 The A380 goes to Chiang Mai 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.540
 The city is located in the north of Thailand and 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.680
 also gets affectionate from the inhabitants 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.680
 called rose of the north 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.829
 After about 14 hours of flight then it goes 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.629
 Continue with shuttle bus during the ride 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.849
 our girls already collect first 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.780
 impressions 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.430
 they can only watch everything on TV 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:36.739
 and now you can see that here too 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:38.900
 and so people were right-hand traffic 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.189
 quite two clauses on it first 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.480
 I used to like to leave 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.480
 sometime opposite to the demand 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:04.180
 pages and so little was it somehow 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.419
 somewhere a mistake still 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.680
 welcome to the spa hotel avita 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.599
 organizer martin heimers and skistar 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.769
 milena have already driven up and 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.930
 Have the girls on their room 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.620
 Checked in there are still some 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.620
 a few infos 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.380
 Welcome to Thailand if you are light 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.120
 recovered and did not like it 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.830
 exhausting flight because you know 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.630
 that really a brother to you the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.160
 is still a number harder and though 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.720
 he will now only after the flight 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.890
 I can do a little bit fresh 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.510
 her not be like something else what else 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.640
 Know this year at Socialist Kabi 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.310
 we have a very special highlight 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.740
 and my big parisian fashion and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.740
 company has this in autumn 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.000
 a campaign worth nine years 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.700
 million euros starts 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 and they are looking for an underwater model 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.650
 what gives the campaign a face 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.830
 and if everything works out then 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.480
 Two of you will come to Paris 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.820
 presented to the great master and if 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.280
 everything works out then there is a sum 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.180
 between 30 and 50 thousand euro fee 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.510
 in the room 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.170
 oh my gods girls exhausting that is 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.170
 a huge chance 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.790
 So it makes you even better known and 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.200
 it has a great experience and yes 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.640
 it is now even more time 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.840
 and somehow it still has a spur now 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.030
 to give even more gas 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.260
 That 's the right attitude 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.260
 now the room first 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:52.339
 super classic behind but I think we 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.199
 should prepare as energy refueling 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:56.149
 And the clinic days are really round 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.860
 that gives a focus on water sports there 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.239
 So the girls have their diving license 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.219
 have dived from no like a dive 

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:03.309
 that little bit of kini shooting was done 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.300
 for some already with limits rog but 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.409
 of course only the entry into the whole 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.399
 thing and now it is in thailand 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.889
 of course then right thing 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:11.959
 for now there is no time to rest 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.639
 the opponents have in the 

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:13.969
 next days a tight program 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.219
 yourself 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.429
 so fresh and keep going 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.429
 s 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:35.460
 why is it already where it goes now 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:39.780
 is not so wild here so so first 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.070
 right as a winner because you stop 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.730
 a lot on tv, that's it 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.730
 not so harmless 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.450
 Diester discovery is not for 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.700
 sissies 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.470
 that is why the organizer is martin häners 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.390
 the participants always strive for that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.870
 before the largest possible challenges to 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.880
 put 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.860
 we now know that we have nothing to do with it 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.300
 elephants will do it because that's it 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.950
 Of course, there were already last year 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.930
 that means something else is coming 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.240
 something really cool and exciting 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.980
 but we have to go with Rice 2 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.690
 the courage of the finalists for the first time 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.640
 put to the test one may do that 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.890
 do not adapt we will leave yes 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.940
 becomes one of the girls right at the first 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.940
 pinch shooting
