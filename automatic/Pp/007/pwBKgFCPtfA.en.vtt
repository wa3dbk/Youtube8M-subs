hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.260> Ellie<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.890> welcome<00:00:02.669> to

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hey guys this is Ellie and welcome to

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys this is Ellie and welcome to
another<00:00:03.000> tutorial<00:00:03.300> for<00:00:03.870> thier<00:00:04.410> plans<00:00:04.650> for<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
another tutorial for thier plans for the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.490 
another tutorial for thier plans for the
actually<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:06.049> got<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> question

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
actually I got a question

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.180 
actually I got a question
and<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.040> my<00:00:08.189> terpenes<00:00:08.820> 4d<00:00:09.150> tutorials

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
and one of my terpenes 4d tutorials

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.650 
and one of my terpenes 4d tutorials
someone<00:00:11.190> asked<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.580> create<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> small

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
someone asked how to create a small

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.290 
someone asked how to create a small
motion<00:00:12.900> or<00:00:13.320> full<00:00:14.160> smoke<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:15.260> fire<00:00:16.260> simulation

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
motion or full smoke or fire simulation

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.560 
motion or full smoke or fire simulation
so<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:19.230> pretty<00:00:19.500> easy<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
so it's pretty easy see I have here a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.859 
so it's pretty easy see I have here a
simple<00:00:22.170> setup<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> smoke

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
simple setup for you know a smoke

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.439 
simple setup for you know a smoke
simulation<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.830> if<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.699> didn't<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> don't

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
simulation so if you didn't if you don't

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.960 
simulation so if you didn't if you don't
know<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> create<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.699> don't<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
know how to create I don't know the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.770 
know how to create I don't know the
basic<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.529> terpenes<00:00:31.529> fully<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.070> did<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
basic of terpenes fully I did some you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.319 
basic of terpenes fully I did some you
know<00:00:33.899> basic<00:00:34.890> controls<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.180> go

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
know basic controls for it so you can go

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.590 
know basic controls for it so you can go
and<00:00:36.480> check<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.840> channel<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.910> alright

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and check my channel for that so alright

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.350 
and check my channel for that so alright
so<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.559> first<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
so the first thing you will need is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.340 
so the first thing you will need is
select<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> container<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
select the container and go to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.380 
select the container and go to
simulation<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.190> timing<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.230> timing<00:00:46.559> tab

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
simulation and timing in the timing tab

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.940 
simulation and timing in the timing tab
you<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.690> time<00:00:48.960> scale<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> where

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you will have time scale this is where

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.020 
you will have time scale this is where
you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.250> create<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.789> flaws<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.960> know

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
you can create the flaws you know

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
you can create the flaws you know
slow-motion<00:00:54.030> come<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.420> fact<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.559> let

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
slow-motion come up a fact so that's let

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.880 
slow-motion come up a fact so that's let
me<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> simple<00:00:56.550> setup<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> at

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
me just do a simple setup for it so at

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.369 
me just do a simple setup for it so at
zero<00:00:59.399> from<00:01:00.149> zero<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> frame<00:01:00.989> theory

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
zero from zero to the frame theory

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
zero from zero to the frame theory
everything<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> normal<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.239> let's<00:01:03.420> add<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
everything is normal so let's add the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
everything is normal so let's add the
keyframe<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.739> control<00:01:05.189> click<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
keyframe to this so control click on the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
keyframe to this so control click on the
circle<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.680> either<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> keyframe<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.400> us

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
circle and either the keyframe for us

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.170 
circle and either the keyframe for us
and<00:01:09.140> from<00:01:10.140> 30<00:01:10.439> second<00:01:10.950> 30<00:01:11.580> frame<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.510> frame<00:01:13.170> 60

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
and from 30 second 30 frame to frame 60

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.940 
and from 30 second 30 frame to frame 60
we<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.299> add<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.740> say<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.430> example<00:01:19.070> 5<00:01:20.070> oh

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
we will add this to say for example 5 oh

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.520 
we will add this to say for example 5 oh
sorry<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.280> bad<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.840> frame<00:01:25.170> 60

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
sorry my bad it will frame 60

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.150 
sorry my bad it will frame 60
all<00:01:28.070> right<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.640> make<00:01:29.300> this<00:01:29.480> five<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:31.040> it's

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
all right and make this five so it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.990 
all right and make this five so it's
going<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.370> be<00:01:31.460> very<00:01:31.820> slow<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:34.240> from<00:01:35.240> frame<00:01:35.900> 61

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
going to be very slow and from frame 61

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.950 
going to be very slow and from frame 61
let's<00:01:38.000> add<00:01:38.180> another<00:01:38.210> keyframe<00:01:38.720> at<00:01:39.280> 5%<00:01:40.280> and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
let's add another keyframe at 5% and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.280 
let's add another keyframe at 5% and
move<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.110> frame<00:01:42.290> 62<00:01:43.220> or<00:01:44.020> actually<00:01:45.020> move<00:01:45.170> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
move to frame 62 or actually move to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.859 
move to frame 62 or actually move to
frame<00:01:45.470> 90<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.360> make<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:48.520> 100<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.840> add<00:01:50.840> a

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
frame 90 and make this to 100 and add a

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.520 
frame 90 and make this to 100 and add a
keyframe<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.000> from<00:01:53.000> 0<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.420> 30<00:01:53.660> everything<00:01:54.410> is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
keyframe so from 0 to 30 everything is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.930 
keyframe so from 0 to 30 everything is
normal<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.300> from<00:01:56.300> 30<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.780> 60<00:01:57.310> slow<00:01:58.310> motion<00:01:58.790> and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
normal and from 30 to 60 slow motion and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.830 
normal and from 30 to 60 slow motion and
from<00:01:59.930> 60<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.729> 290<00:02:01.729> everything<00:02:02.420> goes<00:02:02.570> back<00:02:02.810> to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
from 60 to 290 everything goes back to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.950 
from 60 to 290 everything goes back to
normal<00:02:03.250> all<00:02:04.250> right<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.640> let's<00:02:04.880> resume<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.450> so

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
normal all right so let's resume this so

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.590 
normal all right so let's resume this so
select<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> container<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.100> go<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.090> plug<00:02:08.420> in

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
select the container and go to plug in

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.430 
select the container and go to plug in
and<00:02:08.979> select<00:02:09.979> terpenes<00:02:10.580> for<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.910> terpenes<00:02:11.480> for

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
and select terpenes for the terpenes for

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.240 
and select terpenes for the terpenes for
the<00:02:12.560> simulation<00:02:13.340> window<00:02:14.650> alright<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.950> let's

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
the simulation window alright so let's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.830 
the simulation window alright so let's
start<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.640> everything<00:02:20.000> normal<00:02:20.360> now<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.690> think

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
start so everything normal now I think

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.800 
start so everything normal now I think
go<00:02:21.140> slow<00:02:21.380> motion<00:02:22.450> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
go slow motion and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.710 
go slow motion and
[Music]

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
[Music]

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.340 
[Music]
everything<00:02:28.500> goes<00:02:28.680> goes<00:02:28.920> back<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.340> normal<00:02:33.350> all

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
everything goes goes back to normal all

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.960 
everything goes goes back to normal all
right<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.710> let's<00:02:34.920> watch<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.280> animation<00:02:37.970> so

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
right so let's watch this animation so

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.170 
right so let's watch this animation so
that<00:02:39.000> play<00:02:39.830> its<00:02:40.830> normal<00:02:41.310> slow<00:02:41.580> motion

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that play its normal slow motion

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.090 
that play its normal slow motion
everything's<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:43.380> see<00:02:43.560> how<00:02:43.650> slow<00:02:43.830> them

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
everything's back can see how slow them

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.390 
everything's back can see how slow them
slow<00:02:44.520> motion<00:02:44.850> happen<00:02:45.180> pretty<00:02:45.900> fast<00:02:46.170> actually

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.500 

but<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.490> know<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> better<00:02:51.300> than<00:02:51.450> I

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
but you know you can do it better than I

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.930 
but you know you can do it better than I
did<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> over<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:52.770> can<00:02:53.010> you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
did it over here you know you can you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.670 
did it over here you know you can you
know<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.210> more<00:02:54.480> kind<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.810> smooth<00:02:55.260> kind<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
know get a more kind of smooth kind of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.980 
know get a more kind of smooth kind of
slow<00:02:56.280> motion<00:02:56.670> also<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.720> play

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
slow motion also you can have a play

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.380 
slow motion also you can have a play
with<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.460> keyframe<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> timeline

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
with the keyframe in the timeline

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.420 
with the keyframe in the timeline
so<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.580> go<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.820> view<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.760> F<00:03:05.760> curve<00:03:06.240> mode

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
so we can go to view and F curve mode

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.820 
so we can go to view and F curve mode
select<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.490> container<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.650> actually<00:03:10.650> let's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
select the container and actually let's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.920 
select the container and actually let's
open<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.250> window<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:13.700> scale<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.750> can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
open this window and scale it so we can

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.630 
open this window and scale it so we can
see<00:03:16.080> our<00:03:16.200> keyframe<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.340> see<00:03:17.490> how<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
see our keyframe so you can see how the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.180 
see our keyframe so you can see how the
keyframe<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.270> going<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.660> know<00:03:18.920> maybe<00:03:19.920> we<00:03:20.100> can

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
keyframe is going you know maybe we can

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.000 
keyframe is going you know maybe we can
select<00:03:20.520> all<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.700> them<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:22.020> write<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.410> click

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.340 

actually<00:03:26.570> let's<00:03:27.570> select<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.990> first

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
actually let's select this first

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.350 
actually let's select this first
keyframe

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.830 

and<00:03:34.900> have<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> play<00:03:35.470> with<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:37.500> spline<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.530> guess

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and have a play with the spline I guess

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.570 
and have a play with the spline I guess
you<00:03:40.840> can<00:03:41.110> see<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.710> we<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:41.980> two<00:03:42.310> keyframes

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
you can see is the we have two keyframes

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.980 
you can see is the we have two keyframes
actually

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.990 

select<00:03:51.990> both<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.260> them<00:03:52.560> write<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> click<00:03:53.430> spline

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
select both of them write a click spline

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.520 
select both of them write a click spline
time<00:03:54.740> Easy's

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:13.230 

all<00:04:04.400> right

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.920 

all<00:04:13.780> right<00:04:13.960> that<00:04:14.110> looks<00:04:14.260> good<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.710> guess<00:04:15.930> you're

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
all right that looks good I guess you're

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.290 
all right that looks good I guess you're
not<00:04:17.050> just<00:04:17.260> something<00:04:17.650> simple<00:04:18.220> just<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.940> test

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
not just something simple just the test

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:29.580 
not just something simple just the test
that<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.600> guess<00:04:19.950> select<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.070> one

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:46.490 

going<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.770> click<00:04:31.010> on<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.670> Splatt<00:04:32.180> type<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:34.400> ease

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.800 

all<00:04:47.070> right<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.430> looks<00:04:47.580> good<00:04:47.850> let's<00:04:48.570> say

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
all right that looks good let's say

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.690 
all right that looks good let's say
recent<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:50.010> I'm<00:04:50.130> just<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.490> pause

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
recent this so I'm just going to pause

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.670 
recent this so I'm just going to pause
and<00:04:51.120> come<00:04:51.780> back<00:04:51.960> when<00:04:52.170> it's<00:04:52.290> done

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
and come back when it's done

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.500 
and come back when it's done
all<00:04:52.830> right<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.400> done<00:04:53.610> let's<00:04:54.060> take<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.240> look

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
all right so it's done let's take a look

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.410 
all right so it's done let's take a look
at<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.870> simulation<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:56.000> render<00:04:57.000> pretty<00:04:57.210> fast

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
at the simulation I render pretty fast

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.370 
at the simulation I render pretty fast
actually<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.840> don't<00:04:57.900> know<00:04:58.080> whether<00:04:58.230> they<00:04:58.350> even

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
actually I don't know whether they even

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.640 
actually I don't know whether they even
pause<00:04:59.390> so<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.510> can<00:05:00.660> see<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:00.900> it's<00:05:01.500> much

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
pause so you can see it it's much

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.770 
pause so you can see it it's much
smoother<00:05:02.220> no<00:05:04.460> slow<00:05:05.460> motion<00:05:05.730> everything<00:05:06.600> goes

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
smoother no slow motion everything goes

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.930 
smoother no slow motion everything goes
back<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.110> normal<00:05:07.260> so<00:05:08.100> this<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.460> how<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:08.640> create

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
back to normal so this is how you create

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.980 
back to normal so this is how you create
the<00:05:09.240> slow<00:05:10.140> motion<00:05:10.350> kind<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.770> effect<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
the slow motion kind of effect and

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.450 
the slow motion kind of effect and
interpreters<00:05:12.990> for<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.290> so<00:05:13.740> pretty<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.340> know

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
interpreters for the so pretty you know

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.370 
interpreters for the so pretty you know
but<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:15.360> know<00:05:15.450> I<00:05:15.480> guess<00:05:15.720> some<00:05:15.930> people<00:05:15.960> don't

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
but you know I guess some people don't

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.930 
but you know I guess some people don't
know<00:05:16.470> about<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.860> but<00:05:17.460> yeah<00:05:17.610> thanks<00:05:17.910> for

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
know about it but yeah thanks for

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.630 
know about it but yeah thanks for
watching<00:05:18.030> guys<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.830> hopefully<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:20.490> know<00:05:20.610> you

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
watching guys and hopefully you know you

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.040 
watching guys and hopefully you know you
find<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:22.190> helpful<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.660> I'll<00:05:24.660> see<00:05:24.720> in<00:05:24.990> the
