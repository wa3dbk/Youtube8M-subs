bedrock now if you wanted to have a flat

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.679 
bedrock now if you wanted to have a flat
land<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.610> know<00:01:23.700> God's<00:01:23.909> tile<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.509> is

land that is you know God's tile this is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.620 
land that is you know God's tile this is
what<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.130> most<00:01:26.759> I'll<00:01:27.060> mostly

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
what you will use but I most I'll mostly

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
what you will use but I most I'll mostly
use<00:01:27.869> void<00:01:28.409> walls<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.700> go

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
use void walls and how I do that I go

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
use void walls and how I do that I go
back<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> presets<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.869> delete<00:01:31.650> everything<00:01:32.250> at

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
back to presets I delete everything at

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
back to presets I delete everything at
the<00:01:33.000> top<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.450> except<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.140> where<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> says

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the top here except for where it says

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
the top here except for where it says
bedrock<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> beginning<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.509> going

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
bedrock in the beginning I'm just going

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.850 
bedrock in the beginning I'm just going
to<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.350> well<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.710> say<00:01:38.540> :

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
to take that out as well and just say :

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.670 
to take that out as well and just say :
air<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.270> semi<00:01:42.630> come<00:01:42.750> along<00:01:42.960> right

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
air and then we go semi come along right

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920 
air and then we go semi come along right
so<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.490> number<00:01:44.759> three<00:01:45.060> OVA<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.689> version

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so the number three OVA is the version

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.179 
so the number three OVA is the version

we<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> Minecraft<00:01:55.770> s<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
we have the Minecraft s we're going to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.660 
we have the Minecraft s we're going to
have<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.909> layer<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.600> air<00:01:57.899> okay<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.460> we

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
have one layer of air okay and then we

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.120 
have one layer of air okay and then we
are<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.360> nine<00:02:00.719> now<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.439> nine<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
are going to put a nine now this nine is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.359 
are going to put a nine now this nine is
the<00:02:02.159> biome<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.170> version<00:02:04.380> number<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the biome so it's the version number the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.320 
the biome so it's the version number the
blocks<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.030> make<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.079> actual<00:02:08.000> world<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
blocks that make up the actual world and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.869 
blocks that make up the actual world and
then<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.959> biome<00:02:10.379> okay<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:10.890> you'll<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.489> I

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
then the biome okay now you'll see if I

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.080 
then the biome okay now you'll see if I
wanted<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.270> add<00:02:12.420> more<00:02:12.690> block

wanted to add more block

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.910 
wanted to add more block
I<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.660> example<00:02:13.720> add<00:02:14.200> another<00:02:14.620> block<00:02:14.890> by

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I can for example add another block by

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.320 
I can for example add another block by
going<00:02:15.840> comma<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.379> minecraft<00:02:18.040> caus<00:02:18.700> :

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
going comma and then minecraft caus :

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.050 
going comma and then minecraft caus :
stone<00:02:20.319> okay<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.160> don't<00:02:21.340> want<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.849> we

0 64 0 so it means I'm going to go to

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.000 
0 64 0 so it means I'm going to go to
the<00:03:33.790> x<00:03:34.000> coordinate<00:03:34.630> 0<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:35.139> gonna<00:03:35.290> go<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.769> y

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the x coordinate 0 I'm gonna go to the y

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.520 
the x coordinate 0 I'm gonna go to the y
coordinate<00:03:36.549> 64<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.269> I'm<00:03:37.780> going<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.049> go<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.230> the

coordinate 64 and I'm going to go to the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.409 
coordinate 64 and I'm going to go to the
Z<00:03:38.739> coordinate<00:03:39.510> 0<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:42.400> we<00:03:42.489> are<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:43.120> I've

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
Z coordinate 0 and here we are so I've

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.490 
Z coordinate 0 and here we are so I've
got<00:03:43.660> 65<00:03:44.019> blocks<00:03:44.500> before<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:44.889> reach<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:46.500> actual

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
got 65 blocks before I reach the actual

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.400 
got 65 blocks before I reach the actual
void<00:03:47.829> itself<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.549> I've<00:03:49.150> got<00:03:49.329> however<00:03:50.230> many

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
void itself and I've got however many

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.470 
void itself and I've got however many
above<00:03:51.190> me<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.760> could<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.030> can<00:03:52.150> still<00:03:52.359> build

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
above me that I could we can still build

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.569 
above me that I could we can still build
so<00:03:52.660> it's<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.810> nice<00:03:52.959> middle<00:03:53.410> way<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.280> next<00:03:54.489> thing

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
so it's a nice middle way the next thing

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.949 
so it's a nice middle way the next thing
I'm<00:03:54.700> going<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:55.000> do<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.180> I'm<00:03:55.269> going<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.540> go<00:03:55.630> set

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go set

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.099 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go set
block<00:03:56.700> okay<00:03:57.700> now<00:03:57.880> I'm<00:03:58.000> gonna<00:03:58.150> use<00:03:58.239> relative

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
block okay now I'm gonna use relative

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.620 
block okay now I'm gonna use relative
coordinates<00:03:59.829> so<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.549> tilde<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.120> I'm

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
coordinates so this is the tilde and I'm

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.270 
coordinates so this is the tilde and I'm
gonna<00:04:01.780> exactly<00:04:02.440> where<00:04:02.590> I'm<00:04:02.709> standing<00:04:02.950> I'm

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
gonna exactly where I'm standing I'm

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.509 
gonna exactly where I'm standing I'm
going<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.579> put<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.760> stone<00:04:04.090> block<00:04:04.359> okay<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:06.310> I've

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
going to put a stone block okay so I've

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.009 
going to put a stone block okay so I've
got<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.700> stone<00:04:06.940> block<00:04:07.150> exactly<00:04:07.810> where<00:04:07.930> I'm

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
got a stone block exactly where I'm

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.229 
got a stone block exactly where I'm
standing<00:04:08.200> now<00:04:08.380> if<00:04:08.590> we<00:04:08.769> go<00:04:08.950> of<00:04:10.470> f3<00:04:12.030> you'll<00:04:13.030> see

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
standing now if we go of f3 you'll see

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.330 
standing now if we go of f3 you'll see
that<00:04:13.359> there's<00:04:13.569> a<00:04:13.720> lot<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:13.989> Diagnostics<00:04:14.919> that

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
that there's a lot of Diagnostics that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.400 
that there's a lot of Diagnostics that
are<00:04:15.489> shown<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.030> side<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:16.750> as<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.109> can<00:04:17.229> see

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
are shown on the side so as you can see

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.699 
are shown on the side so as you can see
I<00:04:17.440> am<00:04:17.769> looking<00:04:18.190> at<00:04:18.340> block<00:04:18.760> 0<00:04:18.789> 64<00:04:19.720> 0<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:20.590> this

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
I am looking at block 0 64 0 so this

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.030 
I am looking at block 0 64 0 so this
block<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.370> 0<00:04:21.609> 64<00:04:21.969> 0

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
block is 0 64 0

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.920 
block is 0 64 0
right<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:24.000> there's<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.240> couple<00:04:24.420> of<00:04:24.600> things<00:04:24.720> we

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
right now there's a couple of things we

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.810 
right now there's a couple of things we
want<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.140> do<00:04:25.290> first<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:26.040> guess<00:04:26.310> first<00:04:26.580> thing<00:04:26.730> we

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
want to do first I guess first thing we

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.030 
want to do first I guess first thing we
want<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:26.970> do<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.270> set<00:04:27.720> world<00:04:28.050> spawn<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.740> this

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
want to do is set world spawn on this

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.850 
want to do is set world spawn on this
point<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.520> we're<00:04:29.670> gonna<00:04:29.850> go<00:04:29.970> set<00:04:30.650> set<00:04:31.650> world

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
point so we're gonna go set set world

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.370 
point so we're gonna go set set world
spawn<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.340> this<00:04:33.150> just<00:04:33.390> sets<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.840> world<00:04:34.020> spawn

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
spawn and this just sets the world spawn

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.530 
spawn and this just sets the world spawn
actually<00:04:34.860> should<00:04:35.010> be<00:04:35.280> said<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.420> should

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
actually should be said it should

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.940 
actually should be said it should
actually<00:04:36.720> be<00:04:36.870> one<00:04:37.050> down<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.620> yeah

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
actually be one down but it's yeah

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.920 
actually be one down but it's yeah
it<00:04:38.160> sets<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.550> world<00:04:38.700> spawn<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.600> block

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
it sets the world spawn to this block

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.630 
it sets the world spawn to this block
block<00:04:40.590> again<00:04:41.070> which<00:04:41.370> then<00:04:41.610> also<00:04:41.870> moves<00:04:42.870> your

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
block again which then also moves your

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.580 
block again which then also moves your
spawn<00:04:44.640> chunks<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.480> this<00:04:45.630> area<00:04:45.900> now<00:04:46.320> we<00:04:46.380> will

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
spawn chunks to this area now we will

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.020 
spawn chunks to this area now we will
talk<00:04:46.740> about<00:04:46.890> more<00:04:47.130> about<00:04:47.220> spawn<00:04:47.580> chunks<00:04:47.790> and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
talk about more about spawn chunks and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.800 
talk about more about spawn chunks and
coordinates<00:04:48.990> in<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.440> next<00:04:49.800> video<00:04:50.420> okay<00:04:51.420> but

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810
