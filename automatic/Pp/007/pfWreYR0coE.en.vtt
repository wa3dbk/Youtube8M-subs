00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.089

okay<00:02:42.909> so<00:02:42.969> I'll<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.269> do<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:43.599> one<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:44.049> time

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340

you saw breathing on me camera person
it's<00:02:47.170> like<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.620> off-putting<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:52.090> gain

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
it's like really off-putting you gain

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:05.040 
it's like really off-putting you gain
both<00:02:52.480> hands

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.630 

I'll<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.830> one<00:03:05.950> more<00:03:06.190> time<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.610> can

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
I'll do that one more time and you can

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.310 
I'll do that one more time and you can
eat<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.270> make<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.510> more<00:03:07.600> dramatic<00:03:07.690> if<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.140> play

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
eat to make it more dramatic if you play

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.710 
eat to make it more dramatic if you play
up<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.920> higher<00:03:09.130> octave<00:03:09.600> well<00:03:10.600> that's

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
up in the higher octave well that's

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.500 
up in the higher octave well that's
probably<00:03:10.870> slightly<00:03:11.410> too<00:03:11.530> high<00:03:11.740> but<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:13.120> go<00:03:13.390> up

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
probably slightly too high but you go up

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.880 
probably slightly too high but you go up
an<00:03:13.630> octave<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:14.200> sounds<00:03:14.500> sometimes

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
an octave it it sounds sometimes

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.470 
an octave it it sounds sometimes
slightly<00:03:15.460> more<00:03:15.700> dramatic<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:18.270> get<00:03:19.270> in<00:03:19.360> both

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
slightly more dramatic to get in both

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:34.200 
slightly more dramatic to get in both
ends<00:03:20.730> I'll<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:21.910> again<00:03:32.160> that'd<00:03:33.160> be<00:03:33.190> 7th<00:03:33.910> leaves

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
ends I'll do again that'd be 7th leaves

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.960 
ends I'll do again that'd be 7th leaves

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.500 

sorry<00:04:53.700> that's<00:04:53.820> actually<00:04:54.240> not<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.390> right

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
sorry that's actually not the right

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.620 
sorry that's actually not the right
introduction<00:04:55.340> it's<00:04:56.340> not<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> movie<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:57.030> C<00:04:57.480> with

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
introduction it's not a movie in C with

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.520 
introduction it's not a movie in C with
that<00:04:59.720> starts<00:05:00.720> warning<00:05:01.020> with<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.170> boogie<00:05:01.470> in

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
that starts warning with a boogie in

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:13.880 
that starts warning with a boogie in
that<00:05:01.680> if<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.830> want

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.350 

so<00:05:14.890> those<00:05:15.340> are<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.640> couple<00:05:15.670> of<00:05:15.940> ideas<00:05:16.060> for

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
so those are a couple of ideas for

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.240 
so those are a couple of ideas for
introductions<00:05:17.080> even<00:05:17.650> if<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:17.830> can't<00:05:18.070> get

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
introductions even if you can't get
