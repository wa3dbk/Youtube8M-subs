00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

number three probably is is the motor

road a little bit slower in canola with
the<00:01:04.739> Massey<00:01:04.890> combine<00:01:05.370> I<00:01:05.489> tend<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.730> like<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.000> run

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the Massey combine I tend to like to run

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.970 
the Massey combine I tend to like to run
a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.480> faster<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:07.410> around<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.770> age<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
a little bit faster or around the age of

a little bit faster or around the age of
50

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
50

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.039 
50
so

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
so

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
so
those<00:01:11.229> would<00:01:11.380> be<00:01:11.409> my<00:01:11.469> three

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
those would be my three

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.340 
those would be my three
choices<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> comes<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
choices and so when it comes out of the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.539 
choices and so when it comes out of the
separating<00:01:16.350> area<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> threshing<00:01:17.280> area

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
into the separate area and then dropping

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
want your tops if not open all the way

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460

generally<00:01:32.190> have<00:01:32.220> been<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.759> best<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.149> then

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
generally have been the best and then

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.230 
generally have been the best and then

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
your bottom sip

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.999 
your bottom sip
it<00:01:36.540> depends<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.869> conditions<00:01:37.320> again<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> how

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it depends on conditions again and how

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.710 
it depends on conditions again and how
fast<00:01:38.340> them<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> operator<00:01:39.149> wants<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.509> go

fast them the operator wants to go

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.090 
fast them the operator wants to go
might<00:01:41.110> as<00:01:41.230> well

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100

with canola being so small seated there
are<00:01:45.979> tendencies<00:01:46.880> for<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.600> find<00:01:47.990> places<00:01:48.290> to

as a comment gets older obviously you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.090 
as a comment gets older obviously you
know<00:01:59.360> we<00:01:59.509> do<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.659> rubber<00:01:59.990> seals<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:01.070> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
know we do have rubber seals in the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.980 
know we do have rubber seals in the
shaker<00:02:01.430> shoe<00:02:01.670> area<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.509> over<00:02:02.780> time

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
shaker shoe area that over time

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.160 
shaker shoe area that over time
obviously<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.619> wear<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:04.670> are<00:02:04.850> not

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
obviously do wear and they are not

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.480 
obviously do wear and they are not
visibly<00:02:06.170> notice<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.770> by<00:02:06.920> walking<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.310> comb

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
visibly notice just by walking the comb

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.729 
visibly notice just by walking the comb
but<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.820> know<00:02:08.090> where<00:02:08.270> they<00:02:08.360> are<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:09.619> know

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
but you know where they are you know

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.840 
but you know where they are you know
stick<00:02:09.979> your<00:02:10.100> fingers<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.520> they<00:02:10.610> are<00:02:10.670> getting

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
stick your fingers and they are getting

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.850 
stick your fingers and they are getting
or<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.150> get<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.300> light<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.660> there<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.110> look<00:02:12.709> and

or to get a light in there and look and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.130 
or to get a light in there and look and
see<00:02:13.010> if<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.340> actual<00:02:13.700> seal<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.209> wore<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.720> it's

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
see if the actual seal is wore and it's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.750 
see if the actual seal is wore and it's
mostly<00:02:15.410> wrong<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.769> shaker<00:02:15.980> shoe<00:02:16.190> area<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.580> the

front and back of the shaker shoe or I'd

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.110 
front and back of the shaker shoe or I'd
highly<00:02:19.010> recommend<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:19.580> check<00:02:19.819> at<00:02:19.940> least

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
highly recommend they check at least

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.090 
highly recommend they check at least
once<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.480> year<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:21.230> make<00:02:21.260> sure<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.830> seal

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
once a year to make sure that that seal

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.400 
once a year to make sure that that seal
is<00:02:22.370> still<00:02:22.550> there<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.569> not<00:02:23.780> world

July in anticipation of harvest to make

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.800 
July in anticipation of harvest to make
sure<00:02:34.100> their<00:02:34.250> machines<00:02:34.580> are<00:02:34.820> running<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.270> top

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810

spectrum ability definitely and with
that<00:03:14.970> have<00:03:15.330> an<00:03:15.480> impact<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.959> capacity<00:03:16.740> more<00:03:17.130> so

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
that have an impact on capacity more so

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.910 
that have an impact on capacity more so
than<00:03:17.760> loss<00:03:18.030> or<00:03:18.510> both<00:03:19.020> factor<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.680> would<00:03:19.770> be

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
than loss or both factor it would be

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.980 
than loss or both factor it would be
both<00:03:20.100> definitely<00:03:20.760> yeah<00:03:20.940> your<00:03:21.390> comp<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.840> will

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
both definitely yeah your comp I will

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.600 
both definitely yeah your comp I will
definitely<00:03:22.319> perform<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.709> lot<00:03:22.830> better<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.490> know

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
definitely perform a lot better you know

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.460 
definitely perform a lot better you know
when<00:03:23.819> it's<00:03:24.090> within<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.540> tolerances<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.140> we

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
when it's within the tolerances that we

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.710 
when it's within the tolerances that we
specify<00:03:26.069> for<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.310> factory<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:27.420> they're<00:03:27.569> not

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
specify for the factory if they're not

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.390 
specify for the factory if they're not
definitely<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.440> could<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.800> non<00:03:28.980> thrashing

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
definitely you could be non thrashing

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.040 
definitely you could be non thrashing
properly<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.270> your<00:03:30.510> losses<00:03:30.720> could<00:03:30.989> be

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
properly and your losses could be

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.080 
properly and your losses could be
tremendous<00:03:31.620> coming<00:03:32.370> off<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.550> road<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:32.850> even

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
tremendous coming off the road or even

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.930 
tremendous coming off the road or even
on<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.330> sims<00:03:33.569> if<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.810> don't<00:03:33.989> have<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.260> proper

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
on the sims if you don't have the proper

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.880 
on the sims if you don't have the proper
clearances<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.239> actually<00:03:36.390> do

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.100 

any<00:03:39.400> final<00:03:39.940> technical<00:03:40.330> comments<00:03:40.960> you'd<00:03:41.080> like

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
any final technical comments you'd like

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.320 
any final technical comments you'd like
to<00:03:41.260> make

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
to make

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.680 
to make
I<00:03:43.390> think<00:03:44.170> definitely<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:45.310> keep<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.270> combine

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
I think definitely just keep the combine

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.180 
I think definitely just keep the combine
full<00:03:46.960> is<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.440> biggest<00:03:47.770> one

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
full is the biggest one
