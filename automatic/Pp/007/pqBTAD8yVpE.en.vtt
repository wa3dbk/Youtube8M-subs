well<00:03:15.830> not<00:03:16.070> really<00:03:16.550> I<00:03:16.580> haven't<00:03:17.240> worn<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:18.070> used<00:03:19.070> to

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
well not really I haven't worn I used to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.450 
well not really I haven't worn I used to
use<00:03:19.430> um<00:03:19.790> I'm<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.110> Mac<00:03:21.290> Pro<00:03:21.770> Longwear<00:03:21.800> and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
use um I'm at the Mac Pro Longwear and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.030 
use um I'm at the Mac Pro Longwear and
that<00:03:23.060> would<00:03:23.180> just<00:03:23.360> break<00:03:23.510> me<00:03:23.720> out<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.260> bad<00:03:24.500> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
that would just break me out so bad and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.100 
that would just break me out so bad and
I<00:03:25.130> used<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.730> use<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.060> Neutrogena<00:03:26.360> acne<00:03:26.930> one

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
I used to use the Neutrogena acne one

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.100 
I used to use the Neutrogena acne one
and<00:03:27.550> that's<00:03:28.550> because<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.120> felt<00:03:29.360> like<00:03:29.450> liquid

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
and that's because I felt like liquid

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.600 
and that's because I felt like liquid
makeup<00:03:30.350> covers<00:03:30.980> better<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:32.510> um<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:34.430> not

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
makeup covers better but um it's not

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.449 
makeup covers better but um it's not
worth<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.270> gonna<00:03:35.420> be<00:03:35.570> me<00:03:35.630> freaked<00:03:35.959> out

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
worth it if it's gonna be me freaked out

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.090 
worth it if it's gonna be me freaked out
so<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.490> just<00:03:37.910> wear<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.120> powder<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.650> covers<00:03:40.010> up

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
so I just wear a powder and it covers up

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.210 
so I just wear a powder and it covers up
my<00:03:40.250> scars<00:03:40.550> very<00:03:40.820> well<00:03:41.090> um<00:03:41.630> I'll<00:03:42.560> make<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.860> video
