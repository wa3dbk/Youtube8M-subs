conserve<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> illimitable

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.529 

might<00:01:38.829> have<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.340> do<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> couple<00:01:39.789> of<00:01:39.969> pieces<00:01:40.119> if

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
might have to do a couple of pieces if

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.899 
might have to do a couple of pieces if
your<00:01:40.689> aluminum<00:01:40.899> foil<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.619> not<00:01:41.920> during<00:01:42.250> why<00:01:42.429> I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
your aluminum foil is not during why I

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.990 
your aluminum foil is not during why I
do<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.990> fold<00:01:44.259> it<00:01:44.380> over<00:01:44.469> like<00:01:44.649> this<00:01:45.039> make<00:01:45.969> a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
do is I fold it over like this make a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.779 
do is I fold it over like this make a
crease<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:47.170> then<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.560> know<00:01:47.619> where<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.369> cut<00:01:48.579> my

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
crease and then I know where to cut my

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.230 
crease and then I know where to cut my
aluminum<00:01:49.119> foil<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:51.039> aluminum<00:01:51.549> foil<00:01:51.819> will<00:01:52.090> be

and<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.369> don't<00:02:03.579> need<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.759> much<00:02:04.090> rubber

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
and you don't need that much rubber

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.940 
and you don't need that much rubber
cement<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:05.079> just<00:02:05.289> need<00:02:05.500> enough<00:02:05.740> rubber

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:20.740 
cement to secure the aluminum foil to
the<00:02:10.899> box

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.180 

and<00:02:21.050> only<00:02:21.620> put<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> rubber<00:02:22.430> cement<00:02:22.730> prior<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
and only put the rubber cement prior to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:34.090 
and only put the rubber cement prior to
cutting<00:02:25.190> your<00:02:25.310> aluminum<00:02:25.520> foil<00:02:32.890> by<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.950> way

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
cutting your aluminum foil by the way

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.760 
cutting your aluminum foil by the way
around<00:02:34.220> make<00:02:34.490> sure<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.000> shiny<00:02:35.300> side<00:02:35.770> is

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
around make sure that the shiny side is

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.880 
around make sure that the shiny side is
up<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.490> your<00:02:37.640> aluminum<00:02:37.850> foil<00:02:38.650> again<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.860> can

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
up of your aluminum foil again you can

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.000 
up of your aluminum foil again you can
trim<00:02:40.220> around<00:02:40.480> while<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.600> Blues<00:02:41.780> brine<00:02:42.230> drying

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
trim around while the Blues brine drying

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.560 
trim around while the Blues brine drying
you<00:02:43.370> can<00:02:43.640> secure<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.270> with<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:45.350> closed<00:02:45.620> path<00:02:49.570> you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
you can secure it with a closed path you

00:02:50.570 --> 00:03:14.300 
you can secure it with a closed path you
need<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.870> repeat<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.410> process

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:28.960 

you

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.220 

so<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.180> good<00:03:30.300> thing<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.630> use<00:03:30.660> rubber

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
so it's a good thing to use rubber

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.610 
so it's a good thing to use rubber
cement<00:03:31.530> outside<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:33.960> working<00:03:34.320> with<00:03:34.440> children

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
cement outside and working with children

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:45.350 
cement outside and working with children
because<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.890> again<00:03:44.160> make<00:03:44.520> sure<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:45.090> you

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
because and again make sure that you

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.590 
because and again make sure that you
place<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.900> sunny<00:03:46.230> side<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.740> shiny<00:03:47.190> side<00:03:47.520> up<00:03:47.600> not

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
place it sunny side up shiny side up not

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.880 
place it sunny side up shiny side up not
the<00:03:48.810> bill<00:03:48.990> side<00:03:51.170> sure<00:03:52.170> it's<00:03:52.380> going<00:03:52.710> in<00:03:52.860> the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
the bill side sure it's going in the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.370
