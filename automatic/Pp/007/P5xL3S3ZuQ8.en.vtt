00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it which is what this is and then we're

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160 
it which is what this is and then we're
going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> crochet<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.750> gonna<00:00:42.930> show<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.079> how

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
see the difference or actually it looks

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.569 
see the difference or actually it looks
exactly<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.850> same<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.450> either<00:00:49.079> way<00:00:49.579> it's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
exactly the same so either way it's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
exactly the same so either way it's
great<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> start<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.350> bit

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
great to start so it's a little bit

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.029 
great to start so it's a little bit
different<00:00:53.070> than<00:00:53.460> normal<00:00:53.730> crocheting<00:00:55.039> well

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
different than normal crocheting well

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 
different than normal crocheting well
you<00:00:56.370> still<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> whole<00:00:57.570> crochet<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you still do the whole crochet thing but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
you still do the whole crochet thing but
I'm<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> start<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:02.149> did<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.239> earlier

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I'm so start out I did this earlier

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
I'm so start out I did this earlier
today<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

remember and then walk you through it so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740 
remember and then walk you through it so
what<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.040> stick<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:09.479> crochet

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
what you do is you stick your crochet

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170 
what you do is you stick your crochet
hook<00:01:09.930> through<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:11.909> using

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
hook through here and what I'm using

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480 
hook through here and what I'm using
right<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.930> G<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
right now is a G but I think you can I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.749 
right now is a G but I think you can I
was<00:01:14.670> using<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.180> k<00:01:15.840> hook<00:01:16.110> earlier<00:01:16.560> um<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.610> don't

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
was using it k hook earlier um I don't

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.190 
was using it k hook earlier um I don't
think<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.090> matters<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.659> size<00:01:18.810> cuz

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
think it really matters this size cuz

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
think it really matters this size cuz
you<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.729> gauges<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.420> set

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you kind of have your gauges kind of set

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.160 
you kind of have your gauges kind of set
by<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> size<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> box<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.170> what

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
by the size of the box so and then what

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.340 
by the size of the box so and then what
i<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.409> doing<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.960> stick<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:27.990> back

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
i was doing is you just stick that back

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.640 
i was doing is you just stick that back
in<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.130> basically<00:01:29.939> chain<00:01:30.509> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> ignore

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
in and basically chain kind of ignore

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.929 
in and basically chain kind of ignore
the<00:01:31.770> fact<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.040> there's<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.369> ruffle<00:01:32.700> part

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the fact that there's this ruffle part

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.870 
the fact that there's this ruffle part
and<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.600> pretend<00:01:33.840> you're<00:01:34.079> chaining<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
and just pretend you're chaining and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
and just pretend you're chaining and
then<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:38.100> kinda<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> double<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> over

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
then you kinda have to double it over

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.090 
then you kinda have to double it over
and<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.380> starting<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> middle

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
and if you're not starting in the middle

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.240 
and if you're not starting in the middle
of<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.430> thing<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.790> i<00:01:41.970> am<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:43.130> would<00:01:44.130> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of your thing like i am you would just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
of your thing like i am you would just
count<00:01:44.520> over<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:45.090> many<00:01:45.390> boxes<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
count over how many boxes you want to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
count over how many boxes you want to
have<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.250> cross<00:01:47.520> which<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:48.000> basically<00:01:48.119> be

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
have a cross which would basically be

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
have a cross which would basically be
like<00:01:48.570> your<00:01:48.899> first<00:01:49.110> chaining<00:01:49.920> line<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.310> you're

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
like your first chaining line if you're

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
like your first chaining line if you're
doing<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.970> scarf<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:51.840> i'm<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.259> to

basically<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.319> single<00:02:44.709> crochet<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.420> just

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
basically a single crochet so it just

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.380 
basically a single crochet so it just
once<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.950> get<00:02:48.100> over<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.640> fact<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:49.269> all

once you get over the fact that it's all
roughly<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:49.989> pretty<00:02:50.290> much<00:02:50.380> just<00:02:50.440> like

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
roughly it's pretty much just like

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
night and I did it in the round so

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.190 
night and I did it in the round so
you've<00:05:24.450> got<00:05:24.480> this<00:05:25.160> just<00:05:26.160> kind<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:28.020> looks

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
you've got this just kind of it looks

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200 
you've got this just kind of it looks
like<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.380> caterpillar<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:29.700> kind<00:05:29.880> of<00:05:29.910> feels<00:05:30.030> like

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
like a caterpillar it kind of feels like

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.720 
like a caterpillar it kind of feels like
a<00:05:30.270> caterpillar<00:05:30.480> too<00:05:31.010> but<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.040> was<00:05:32.250> thinking<00:05:32.550> it

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
a caterpillar too but I was thinking it

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.730 
a caterpillar too but I was thinking it
would<00:05:32.850> look<00:05:33.330> really<00:05:33.390> cool<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:34.110> lot<00:05:34.320> like<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.500> boa

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
would look really cool a lot like a boa

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.930 
would look really cool a lot like a boa
and<00:05:35.610> if<00:05:36.480> you<00:05:36.600> do<00:05:36.840> do<00:05:37.230> this<00:05:37.490> beware<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.520> it's

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
and if you do do this beware that it's

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.659 
and if you do do this beware that it's
really<00:05:39.419> really<00:05:39.690> tight<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.380> it's<00:05:40.740> super<00:05:41.520> super

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
really really tight so it's super super

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.909 
really really tight so it's super super
roughly<00:05:42.150> but<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.480> is<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:43.050> think<00:05:43.110> once<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:43.770> gets

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
roughly but it is I think once it gets

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.500 
roughly but it is I think once it gets
longer<00:05:44.640> it's<00:05:44.940> gonna<00:05:45.030> be<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.270> little<00:05:45.390> bit

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
longer it's gonna be a little bit

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.240 
longer it's gonna be a little bit
heavier<00:05:45.870> but<00:05:46.080> that's<00:05:46.590> just<00:05:46.710> kind<00:05:46.980> of<00:05:47.010> another

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
heavier but that's just kind of another

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.379 
heavier but that's just kind of another
cool<00:05:47.640> theme

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389
