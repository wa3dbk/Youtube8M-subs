my videos and go back year after year

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640 
my videos and go back year after year
after<00:02:13.770> year<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.880> will<00:02:15.060> see<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:16.050> i<00:02:16.350> made<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
after year you will see that i made a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.490 
after year you will see that i made a
video<00:02:16.830> i<00:02:17.580> think<00:02:18.360> was<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.720> Keith<00:02:19.170> Oberman

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
video i think was like Keith Oberman

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040 
video i think was like Keith Oberman
when<00:02:19.890> Keith<00:02:20.130> Olbermann<00:02:20.460> was<00:02:20.580> at<00:02:20.700> MSNBC<00:02:21.600> his

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
when Keith Olbermann was at MSNBC his

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.110 
when Keith Olbermann was at MSNBC his
accountant<00:02:22.740> out<00:02:22.800> or<00:02:22.920> whatever<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> video

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

talking<00:02:25.890> about<00:02:26.540> using<00:02:27.540> ratliff<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:29.660> defensive

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
talking about using ratliff a defensive

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.050 
talking about using ratliff a defensive
tackle<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.170> 34<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.190> said<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.700> were<00:02:32.850> actually

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
tackle in 34 and I said we were actually

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.330 
tackle in 34 and I said we were actually
we<00:02:33.390> were<00:02:33.540> completely<00:02:33.870> punishing<00:02:34.830> his<00:02:35.040> body

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
we were completely punishing his body

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.970 
we were completely punishing his body
and<00:02:35.750> even<00:02:36.750> though<00:02:36.930> rattlers<00:02:37.320> rabbit<00:02:37.800> has<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and even though rattlers rabbit has a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.820 
and even though rattlers rabbit has a
high<00:02:38.280> motor<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.930> physics<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.650> you're

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
high motor it's physics that you're

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.260 
high motor it's physics that you're
dealing<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.160> right<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.670> you've<00:02:42.060> got<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
dealing with right there you've got a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.420 
dealing with right there you've got a
smaller<00:02:42.720> human<00:02:43.170> being<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:44.070> against

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
smaller human being going up against

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.150 
smaller human being going up against
monsters<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> middle<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.160> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
monsters in the middle of the the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.210 
monsters in the middle of the the
offensive<00:02:47.550> line<00:02:47.700> over<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.420> over<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.320> over<00:02:49.590> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
offensive line over and over and over so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.180 
offensive line over and over and over so
I<00:02:50.520> think<00:02:50.640> rats<00:02:51.150> body<00:02:51.660> has<00:02:51.959> taken<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.680> taking

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
I think rats body has taken it is taking

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.670 
I think rats body has taken it is taking
a<00:02:53.280> toll<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.610> his<00:02:54.120> body<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.720> there's<00:02:55.350> nothing

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
a toll on his body and there's nothing

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.010 
a toll on his body and there's nothing
he<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> player<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.209> about<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.870> his

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
he as a player can do about that if his

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.290 
he as a player can do about that if his
body<00:02:58.290> starts<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.770> break<00:02:58.980> down<00:02:59.040> he<00:02:59.820> can<00:03:00.060> there's

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
body starts to break down he can there's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.240 
body starts to break down he can there's
no<00:03:00.480> willpower<00:03:00.840> cuz<00:03:01.440> rat<00:03:01.680> has<00:03:01.890> all<00:03:02.100> the

willpower in the world he has the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.140 
willpower in the world he has the
greatest<00:03:04.110> motor<00:03:04.500> he<00:03:04.860> says<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.400> willpower<00:03:05.610> has
