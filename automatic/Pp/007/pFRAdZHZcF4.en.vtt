and I want to eject it the traditional

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.530 
and I want to eject it the traditional
way<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.130> doing<00:00:33.250> so<00:00:33.700> would<00:00:33.790> be<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.060> click<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
way of doing so would be to click and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.260 
way of doing so would be to click and
drag<00:00:34.570> this<00:00:35.410> drive<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.370> trash<00:00:36.640> which

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
drag this drive to the trash which

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.970 
drag this drive to the trash which
doesn't<00:00:37.960> look<00:00:38.020> like<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:38.230> trash<00:00:38.530> anymore<00:00:38.890> it

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
doesn't look like a trash anymore it

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.710 
doesn't look like a trash anymore it
looks<00:00:39.130> like<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.370> eject<00:00:39.700> symbol<00:00:40.000> but<00:00:40.390> we<00:00:40.540> want

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
looks like the eject symbol but we want

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.090 
looks like the eject symbol but we want
to<00:00:40.780> do<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:40.990> little<00:00:41.080> bit<00:00:41.260> faster<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.740> actually

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
to do it a little bit faster I actually

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.650 
to do it a little bit faster I actually
use<00:00:42.250> this<00:00:42.400> shortcut<00:00:42.790> key<00:00:42.910> every<00:00:43.180> single<00:00:43.480> time

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
use this shortcut key every single time

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.270 
use this shortcut key every single time
so<00:00:44.110> all<00:00:44.140> we're<00:00:44.500> going<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.740> do<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:45.070> we're<00:00:45.190> going
