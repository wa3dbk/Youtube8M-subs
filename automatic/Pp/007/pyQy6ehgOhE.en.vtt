00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
your predicted hair loss state you'll

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.729 
your predicted hair loss state you'll
want<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.209> cut<00:02:26.450> your<00:02:26.599> hair<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.319> quarter

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
want to cut your hair down to a quarter

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.130 
want to cut your hair down to a quarter
inch<00:02:27.970> don't<00:02:28.970> shave<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.420> all<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> way<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.870> your

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.380 
inch don't shave it all the way to your
scalp<00:02:30.500> because<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.400> can<00:02:31.580> increase<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.209> risk

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
scalp because that can increase the risk

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.990 
scalp because that can increase the risk
of<00:02:32.540> skin<00:02:32.780> infections<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:34.280> reason<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.790> want

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
of skin infections the reason you want

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.540 
of skin infections the reason you want
to<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.810> as<00:02:36.170> much<00:02:36.380> less<00:02:36.800> dramatic<00:02:37.370> to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
to do this it's as much less dramatic to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.059 
to do this it's as much less dramatic to
lose<00:02:37.760> quarter-inch<00:02:38.360> hair<00:02:38.660> than<00:02:39.319> clumps<00:02:39.950> of

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
lose quarter-inch hair than clumps of

longer<00:02:40.670> hair<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:41.120> friend<00:02:41.600> went<00:02:41.810> with<00:02:41.959> me<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.200> cut

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530

through the wild crazy stages where we

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.550 
through the wild crazy stages where we
ultimately<00:02:49.160> ended<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.150> with<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> buzz<00:02:50.780> cut<00:02:51.110> that

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
ultimately ended up with a buzz cut that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.589 
ultimately ended up with a buzz cut that
I<00:02:51.830> dubbed<00:02:52.160> my<00:02:52.580> Sinead<00:02:53.060> O'Connor<00:02:53.569> look<00:02:55.599> your
