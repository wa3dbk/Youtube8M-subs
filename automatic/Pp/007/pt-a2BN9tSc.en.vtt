00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 1 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.370
 at the base what is it 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.070
 There's nothing that a human being can not do 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.590
 to do at the rates existed nobody can say 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 I exist and exist it is not the same 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.540
 thing that life exists and it's a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.220
 feeling 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.870
 it was there a few times you feel 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.100
 fully exist in his life it's 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.650
 because we feel good in his body 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.650
 in his work in relationships in 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.180
 the group of friends etc 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.400
 then a few times bath time are 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.750
 not happy we feel we exist 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.640
 exist so we live it simply 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.340
 and then sometimes we happen 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.710
 helpful we lost someone or someone 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.440
 to us to reject where we lost a 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.470
 professional membership where we have 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.690
 couple worries and suddenly we get 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.880
 feel less stressed we have a feeling 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.950
 actually basically we're not worth 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.270
 great thing that life is not worth big 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.270
 thing that's what the labs 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.710
 pharmaceutical companies have called from 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.960
 of a meteorological metaphor a 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.580
 depression but when we look at this 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 what is a depression for as much as that 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.770
 exists it's the feeling it's the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.930
 feeling that a human being and not 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.640
 no longer exist or two months exist of the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.520
 made first balls he had a 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.610
 in the existing this kind of two things 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.680
 we fall from the sky or young if 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.810
 take the trouble to pick up with 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.939
 the patients which led them to 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.829
 show depressed well we find 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.579
 always a good cream a reason that 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.229
 is quite valid 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.619
 that is, something that attacked 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.060
 strong sense of existence or the couple 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.710
 is a very important source of 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.810
 feeling of existing why because 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.079
 that she the cock gives both of the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.880
 relationship and gives belonging this 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.880
 which will be a problem for therapists 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.979
 English is that these two helps 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.719
 certainly suffers from the couple but the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.479
 solution they have in mind when they 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.610
 come to see me is to explain to me that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.750
 if he suffers it is because of the other 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.430
 the problem is that everyone thinks that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.960
 it's because of the other that is to say 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.300
 that everyone thinks it's the other one who 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.740
 must change and after all will be fine and there 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.850
 is obvious that when we 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.320
 find there the land little of 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.460
 faced with two definitions of 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.990
 problem and 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.090
 we do not see very well how we can 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.820
 solve a problem if it includes 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.080
 definition is actually some 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.940
 moment we have the impression of finding ourselves 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.680
 roland garros wimbledon one we 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.110
 look at it in niqab has yes what it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.340
 said is very fair ma'am not and then 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.710
 after we turn to Madame when 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.000
 we are going to say well yes finally she has 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.730
 maybe also these reasons ie 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.160
 that actually what happens if in term 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.650
 of logic is that everyone is in a 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.170
 linear logic a logic that 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.790
 call cause ali ie everyone is going 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.370
 look for the cause the cause of the problem 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.830
 of course in the other it is clear that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.260
 as long as we are there in no solution 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.000
 will be profiled is also the couple 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.110
 that's good because if they can not find 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.220
 of solution it is also because the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.600
 how and define the one and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.550
 the other the problem of still not 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.750
 does not involve since everyone is waiting 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.990
 claude singing and of course he gets 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.820
 will pass nothing if there is no 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.530
 recipe for happiness all done there is 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.660
 however couples who walk and who 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.700
 succeed where others fail at 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.220
 through this video you will learn 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.930
 how does the couple really work and 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.800
 what are the ingredients of a couple 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.800
 solid and happy
