00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.550 
stuff I thought that was a pretty good a
pretty<00:04:16.760> good<00:04:16.940> action<00:04:17.750> scene<00:04:17.989> right<00:04:18.200> there<00:04:18.229> and

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
I also like the the ending scene where

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.980 
I also like the the ending scene where
there's<00:04:21.950> like<00:04:22.099> a<00:04:22.130> big<00:04:22.430> invasion<00:04:22.820> fight<00:04:23.630> scene
