 hello to all that such a welcome one day 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.340
 more to the channel in today's video I started 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.840
 down here in the title I bring the top 5 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.730
 of February in the products that I have most 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.070
 used during the month and if you fancy 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.600
 know what are you that start in 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.250
 ranked number 5 I want to show these 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.530
 two brushes I'll show you though 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.370
 be two as a single product because 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.770
 they are the brushes that I have used 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.200
 always together they are second law is of 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.630
 the midnight seven or seven midnight 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.850
 good is a seven brushes pack 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.170
 sandoná leis that I want to show you 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.699
 soon I have to make a video 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.590
 but good as I know it proof that 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.030
 I tried these two I love you 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.069
 I want to stand out because I think they are 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.239
 those that I like most of all and fate 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:46.640
 those that I like the most 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.350
 I use this is the 224 has thus ends 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.729
 as in tip and I use this to 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.889
 apply the concealer in the area of 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.550
 hole to apply it and blur what 

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:57.679
 good applied a concealer cream and I 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.949
 like it a lot and then this other one that is 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.469
 the 217 is the one he used to seal the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.239
 corrector I take the powder and with this what 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.770
 stamp because if I do not get into doing 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.110
 folds the concealer under the eyes 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.820
 how you used concealer is sometimes 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.409
 quite dense to cover me 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.090
 because I have quite complex for 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.500
 call me somehow of dark circles 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.970
 like to cover it quite and when 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.010
 you use very dense correctors yes that 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.020
 it is true that I believe expand then the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.040
 seal well and so I have no problem and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.660
 those two brushes the truth is that 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.070
 seems to use I liked later in the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.930
 position number 4 I want to highlight a 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.450
 this mack pompom in particular is the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.160
 sofa believes although I have it half and 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.930
 half with the taylor of the other halves 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.080
 they have them there is a kiss azzurri 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 and nothing simply this is the software 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.070
 is the one above is a color like 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 yellowish or a little skin color 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 yellowish and I like it a lot for 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.790
 apply it on the mobile eyelid you see that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.350
 it melts pretty well I like it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 enough to apply on the eyelid 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.770
 mobile and then mark the basin with 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.420
 a brown cited half a brown cited more 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.850
 clear marcelo darker depends on the day 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.619
 and the external ub a bit darker 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.240
 of black or a darker brown than 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.979
 used for the basin I really like it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 how the eyes look like that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.860
 because the sofa thinks that it is very 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.690
 homogeneous and therefore the outline is 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.599
 mark perfectly and the lashes will 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.970
 they see a lot on that background and then 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.590
 in the marked basin and such was the eye 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 a depth I do not know the truth is that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.030
 I really like it is a look that I use 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.670
 very often and good is a little more or 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 less what it would take today only that the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 eyelid mobile is a tad more 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.240
 yellow the most is basically a look 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.790
 well a marked basin and it's already 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.190
 it's a because I really like the truth is 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.360
 that at first it was not very difficult 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.830
 until the month they came 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.480
 because he said he played a skin color at the end 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.830
 to have a pair in uniform with 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.350
 any neutral shadow I can 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.660
 get but the effect that remains of 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.520
 so homogeneous so clear is not equal 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.500
 that a shadow powder so I'm 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.940
 super happy at number 3 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.060
 I want to place this video cream is the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.530
 nobody that the baby phat and I like 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.540
 much has it a little abandoned 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.300
 but hey it's a bikini that's going 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.950
 well yes it is true that still liking me 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.460
 I have seen clips that I like more like 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.720
 for example the pink d 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.850
 hot pink sorry 2 x 79 then with this 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.410
 I will not repeat but I like it is the one 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.450
 I have now left me a very natural skin 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.670
 you see the imperfections as you can 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.230
 observe but good for day to day 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.150
 to go to work and I like it that way 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.460
 quite let me breathe the skin not 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.840
 melanoma for nothing heavy leaves a 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.880
 natural look but with the tone 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.920
 pretty even and I like it 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.630
 I 'm telling you, I will not repeat with her 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 because I have other vikings that I like 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.040
 more that I find more comfortable to 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.110
 apply and they are not as dense but there is 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090
 a 718 perfectly because soderling 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.820
 what I like in position number 2 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.970
 I want to place the naked bàsics 2 is a 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.700
 palette that I love I love 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.130
 I'm going to go now to Paris, nothing in two 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.440
 days and I'm going to take this along with the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.730
 naked basic 1 are the two policies that 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.410
 I'm going to take it because I'm back in very 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.850
 little because they have all the colors 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.400
 necessary for a natural look 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.320
 as for a look marked at night if 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.970
 I go out at night with those two pallets 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.090
 I have enough for the day if you want 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.020
 go something makeup is also perfect well 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.610
 how good is a palette that I am 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.130
 using a lot and the truth is that 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.090
 I love it and I'm delighted with it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.949
 love 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.540
 number 1 I will repeat with a product 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.030
 that I have already taught you some time are the 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.970
 sea flower terracotta dust I have the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.800
 tone 29 there you see it is a dust that I 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.000
 love I love the look that leaves 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.590
 in the skin you see that I already have super 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.479
 worn is a powder that I like a lot 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.830
 because even with oily skin me 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.590
 it would be very good to avoid being made 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.780
 shines and will live that folds come out 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.230
 I like cardboard but the skin does not seem 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.930
 that I have skin like reinforced concrete 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.930
 I do not know how many I like a product that 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.969
 I love it and well, I'll follow it 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.499
 buying 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.789
 probably unless it appears 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.099
 right now in my life a dust that I 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.289
 I will continue to love it because I 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.789
 I like it a lot if it's true that 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.679
 I have other powders that I also like 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.779
 but good when I use one with color 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:04.759
 and not translucent this is usually because 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.979
 I like it and these are the five 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.329

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.249

 they are basic in your life if you can 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.469
 live without them whatever I will be 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.669

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.649
