00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.740
 I am one of many who collaborates with this 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.180
 social rehabilitation project of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.180

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.360
 9 of the silver but I am one of many 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.570
 who collaborate there the peculiarity 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.750
 is that I'm a rave man and I perform 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.970
 in the judicial power of the province with 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.850
 many years in the criminal sphere then 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.260
 over there it would seem that it was more 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 influence but in reality I am one of 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.850
 so many in this project begins 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.470

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.970
 possible adversity we begin to work 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.830
 in that they had the boys and we got 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.320
 make the kids understand that the 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.920
 life of the other and the senses and that one 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.900
 could differentiate had a regime 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 special behavior very good for 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.760
 can leave if they can not leave and she 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.130
 that helps me and it takes a lot and 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.340
 they are behaving and chatting away 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.990
 then they take you saying you saw they are going 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.050
 behaving better and I know him the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.320
 jail codes I go one day every 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.590
 week for half or two days and we chat 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.070
 but you saw them give them themselves 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.070
 they are working

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.530
 inside the court was one more match 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 what happens that a different party by 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.000
 all the environment that there was but 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.009
 what the radio teaches inside the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840
 three times that nobody hid from 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.560
 the court was king of the teams when 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.009
 the rabbi was already 99 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.110
 we went out we played other games but with 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:15.060
 against a team like this with so much 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.610
 proving good that through the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.620
 Rabbi can be changed too and that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.400
 we are people like everyone I think of a 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.030
 we try 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.269
 show because there is the word that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.700
 this other side there is one thing that is the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.250
 known there is another reality there are people who 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.230
 he really wants to want to be equal 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.659
 footing with those outside people already 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.540
 wrong people that this is not a place 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.359
 of reflection really our function 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.549
 more beyond out and win 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:49.930
 gain from us for the moment 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.700
 fact of having established this here 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.700
