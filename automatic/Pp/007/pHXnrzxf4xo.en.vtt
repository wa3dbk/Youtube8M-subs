it's all designed you know and you know
the<00:00:37.739> intention<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.260> here

the intention of it is to go up here
massive<00:00:41.010> whirlwind<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.879> has<00:00:42.000> been

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
massive whirlwind this has been

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
massive whirlwind this has been
confirmed<00:00:42.480> by<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> designer<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.649> game<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
confirmed by a designer of the game and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.139 
confirmed by a designer of the game and
then<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.059> glide<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.820> massive<00:00:47.820> glide

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
then you glide all the way massive glide

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.990 
then you glide all the way massive glide
what<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.289> call<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.789> ways

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
what I would you know call in some ways

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.680 
what I would you know call in some ways
you<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> Spyro<00:00:52.110> 3<00:00:52.230> clip<00:00:52.860> equivalent<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
you know the Spyro 3 clip equivalent of

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
you know the Spyro 3 clip equivalent of
the<00:00:55.010> autumn<00:00:56.010> Plains<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.840> jump<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.800> glide

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the autumn Plains you know jump or glide

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
the autumn Plains you know jump or glide
you<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> three<00:01:00.960> lives<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
you know to get the three lives it's you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
you know to get the three lives it's you
know<00:01:02.340> repeated<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.149> except<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.290> in

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
know repeated here except you know in

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.250 
know repeated here except you know in
the<00:01:05.460> original<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.180> concept<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> was

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the original you know concept this was

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
the original you know concept this was
meant<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.890> super<00:01:08.159> bonus<00:01:08.490> world<00:01:08.909> portal

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
meant to be the super bonus world portal

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.960 
meant to be the super bonus world portal
or<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.890> probably<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.549> right

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
or like would be probably right right

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.370 
or like would be probably right right
here<00:01:12.240> maybe<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> island<00:01:12.750> would<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.020> slightly

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
here maybe the island would be slightly

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
here maybe the island would be slightly
bigger<00:01:13.650> who<00:01:13.920> knows<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.820> yeah<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> super

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
bigger who knows but yeah the super

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
bigger who knows but yeah the super
bonus<00:01:15.600> portal<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.200> originally<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
bonus portal was originally here so this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.630 
bonus portal was originally here so this
island<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.720> only<00:01:18.960> accessible<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.740> course<00:01:20.040> by

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
island is only accessible of course by

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.020 
island is only accessible of course by
using<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> moon<00:01:22.200> jump<00:01:22.560> which<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.909> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
using the moon jump which is which is a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
using the moon jump which is which is a
shame<00:01:24.270> would<00:01:24.540> love<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.049> able<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> make<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
shame would love to be able to make it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
shame would love to be able to make it
over<00:01:25.979> without<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.869> place

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
over without it but it's at that place

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
over without it but it's at that place
over<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:29.520> forward<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
over there right forward that was the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.880 
over there right forward that was the
original<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.880> idea<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
original you know idea and you know you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.350 
original you know idea and you know you
need<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> come<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.759> you'd<00:01:35.909> fly<00:01:36.180> over

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
need to come from there you'd fly over

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
need to come from there you'd fly over
here<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.079> last<00:01:37.350> level<00:01:37.770> complete<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
here go to your last level complete the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.749 
here go to your last level complete the
game<00:01:38.490> instead<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.689> replaced<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.320> lives

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
game instead they replaced it with lives

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
game instead they replaced it with lives
but<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.960> never<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.340> never<00:01:44.520> reach

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
but then they never you can never reach

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
but then they never you can never reach
it<00:01:44.939> anyway<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> pointless<00:01:46.170> thing

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it anyway so it's like a pointless thing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
it anyway so it's like a pointless thing
draw<00:01:47.220> distance<00:01:47.640> would<00:01:47.790> prevent<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> from

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
draw distance would prevent you from

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999 
draw distance would prevent you from
being<00:01:48.479> able<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.140> lives<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.799> well

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
being able to see these lives as well

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.539 
being able to see these lives as well
pretty<00:01:50.340> much<00:01:50.520> from<00:01:50.700> any<00:01:50.909> angle<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:53.369> was

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
pretty much from any angle so it was

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.660 
pretty much from any angle so it was
kind<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.759> meaningless<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.509> many<00:01:54.720> ways<00:01:55.670> but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
kind of meaningless in many ways but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.300 
kind of meaningless in many ways but
