that<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.090> made<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.810> get<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.440> copper<00:02:13.010> blocks

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that you made and get to copper blocks

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.200 
that you made and get to copper blocks
you<00:02:15.140> make<00:02:15.380> those<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.040> then<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.819> come<00:02:17.270> back<00:02:17.300> to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
you make those and then you come back to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.440 
you make those and then you come back to
with<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.450> portal<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.410> go<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> sell<00:02:19.980> them

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
with the portal and you go to sell them

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.900 
with the portal and you go to sell them
now<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.920> where<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.070> said<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.460> infinite

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
now this is where I said it's infinite

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.370 
now this is where I said it's infinite
you<00:02:24.720> sell<00:02:25.050> them<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.850> for<00:02:26.850> me<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.300> since<00:02:28.230> it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
you sell them and for me I since it's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.050 
you sell them and for me I since it's
like<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> stock<00:02:28.920> market<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> I've<00:02:29.700> already

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
like a stock market and I've already

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.120 
like a stock market and I've already
used<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.660> glitch<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.170> lot<00:02:31.760> see<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.030> 23<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
used this glitch a lot see it's 23 and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.370 
used this glitch a lot see it's 23 and
then<00:02:35.130> as<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.670> keep<00:02:35.850> doing<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.660> price<00:02:37.110> will

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
then as you keep doing it the price will

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.330 
then as you keep doing it the price will
go<00:02:37.770> down<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.840> infinite<00:02:40.380> because<00:02:40.620> I'm

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
go down but it's infinite because I'm

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.980 
go down but it's infinite because I'm
not<00:02:41.550> sure<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:41.880> portals<00:02:42.240> refresh<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:42.810> anything

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
not sure if portals refresh or anything

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.370 
not sure if portals refresh or anything
but<00:02:43.740> if<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.180> get<00:02:45.360> another<00:02:45.450> level<00:02:46.230> five

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
but if you just get another level five

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.010 
but if you just get another level five
trading<00:02:46.650> portal<00:02:47.180> it'll<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> exact<00:02:48.780> same

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
trading portal it'll be the exact same

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.780 
trading portal it'll be the exact same
and<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.710> can<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.070> keep<00:02:50.220> doing<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> see<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and you can just keep doing the see I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.270 
and you can just keep doing the see I
got<00:02:51.090> 46<00:02:52.730> gold<00:02:53.730> coins<00:02:54.030> from<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:55.500> gold<00:02:56.190> coin

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
got 46 gold coins from the one gold coin

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520 
got 46 gold coins from the one gold coin
that<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.700> switch<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that I switch now you can do this in a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
that I switch now you can do this in a
very<00:02:59.100> big<00:02:59.430> quantities<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.180> want<00:03:00.270> that's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
very big quantities if you want that's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.960 
very big quantities if you want that's
why<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.960> didn't<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.740> have<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.160> those<00:03:02.580> 99

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
why I didn't see I have all those 99

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.060 
why I didn't see I have all those 99
corns<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.740> back<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
corns and then I can just go back to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.070 
corns and then I can just go back to
furnace<00:03:05.810> smell<00:03:06.810> 69<00:03:07.680> copper<00:03:08.430> ingots<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.080> then

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
furnace smell 69 copper ingots and then

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.380 
furnace smell 69 copper ingots and then
just<00:03:10.740> watch<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.130> money<00:03:11.310> pile<00:03:11.520> up<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:12.120> speed

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
just watch the money pile up just speed

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.950 
just watch the money pile up just speed
up<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:13.470> really<00:03:13.830> helpful<00:03:14.250> if<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.960> time

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
up it's really helpful if you have time

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.730 
up it's really helpful if you have time
crystals<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.190> takes<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.670> while<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
crystals because it takes a while to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.350 
crystals because it takes a while to
craft<00:03:19.740> everything<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.090> really<00:03:21.330> a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
craft everything but it's not really a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.280 
craft everything but it's not really a
problem<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.340> go<00:03:23.640> back<00:03:23.850> here

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
problem so then you just go back here

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.740 
problem so then you just go back here
you<00:03:25.290> go<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.130> blocks<00:03:26.460> you<00:03:26.940> sell<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.390> now<00:03:27.690> to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
you go to the blocks you sell it now to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.170 
you go to the blocks you sell it now to
to<00:03:28.380> sell<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:28.920> need<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.100> level<00:03:29.430> 5<00:03:29.640> because

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
to sell it you need a level 5 because

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.480 
to sell it you need a level 5 because
that's<00:03:30.420> when<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.720> unlocks<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:32.130> just<00:03:32.310> keep

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
that's when it unlocks you just keep

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.520 
that's when it unlocks you just keep
doing<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.910> my<00:03:33.510> games<00:03:33.810> probably<00:03:34.140> gonna<00:03:34.230> freeze

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
doing it my games probably gonna freeze

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.550 
doing it my games probably gonna freeze
look<00:03:35.160> at<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.520> made<00:03:35.930> 9999<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:37.440> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
look at that I made 9999 and then I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.340 
look at that I made 9999 and then I
probably<00:03:37.800> have<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> lot<00:03:38.370> more<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.030> floor

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
probably have a lot more on the floor

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.000 
probably have a lot more on the floor
and<00:03:40.350> just<00:03:40.410> go<00:03:40.740> back<00:03:41.840> smelt<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.770> can

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and just go back smelt it and you can

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.980 
and just go back smelt it and you can
just<00:03:44.250> keep<00:03:44.460> repeating<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.910> process<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.570> you

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
just keep repeating the process and you

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.730 
just keep repeating the process and you
are<00:03:46.110> good<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:47.150> there<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.390> person<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:48.870> high
