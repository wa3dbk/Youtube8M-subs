00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
and first idea is pretty simple you just

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.700 
and first idea is pretty simple you just
take<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.130> few<00:00:17.369> chocolates<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.170> put

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
note okay and my second idea is putting

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.510 
note okay and my second idea is putting
signs<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.050> their<00:00:34.230> door<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.399> use

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
signs up on their door and you can use

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810 
signs up on their door and you can use
anything<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.510> thought<00:00:37.290> notes<00:00:37.670> like<00:00:38.670> these

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
anything I just thought notes like these

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450 
anything I just thought notes like these
little<00:00:39.030> notepad<00:00:39.300> things<00:00:40.200> would<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.500> okay<00:00:40.530> or

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
little notepad things would be okay or

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.299 
little notepad things would be okay or
you<00:00:41.670> could<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:42.059> big<00:00:42.780> signs<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.739> no

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you could just make big signs and no

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.360 
you could just make big signs and no
color<00:00:44.879> them<00:00:45.120> draw<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.870> them<00:00:46.160> say<00:00:47.160> nice

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
color them draw all over them say nice

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.069 
color them draw all over them say nice
things<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.940> hang<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.690> over<00:00:48.719> their

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
things and hang them up all over their

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.529 
things and hang them up all over their
door<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:50.030> thought<00:00:51.030> that'd<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.239> fun

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

door I thought that'd be fun
and<00:00:52.850> another<00:00:53.850> idea<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.079> take<00:00:55.320> any<00:00:55.879> old

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.700 
and another idea is you can take any old
notebook<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.440> any<00:00:59.219> journal<00:01:00.260> small<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> I
