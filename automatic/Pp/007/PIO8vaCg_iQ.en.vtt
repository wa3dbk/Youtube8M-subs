supposed<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.810> done<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.740> looks<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
supposed to be done is it looks like a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.320 
supposed to be done is it looks like a
backhand<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.670> you're<00:00:23.789> supposed<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> flick

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
backhand but you're supposed to flick

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000 
backhand but you're supposed to flick
your<00:00:24.449> hand<00:00:24.750> hand<00:00:24.960> must<00:00:25.199> remain<00:00:25.439> very<00:00:25.710> very

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
your hand hand must remain very very

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.740 
your hand hand must remain very very
loose<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.400> all<00:00:26.460> times<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.570> see

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to really test it see how Lucia hands

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
to really test it see how Lucia hands
should<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.890> should<00:00:40.920> actually<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.850> should

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
should be you should actually you should

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
should be you should actually you should
hear<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> flapping<00:00:43.320> noise<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.800> that's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
hear it make a flapping noise and that's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.590 
hear it make a flapping noise and that's
you<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> fact<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.329> really

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you know for a fact that it's really

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.729 
you know for a fact that it's really
really<00:00:45.809> loose<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> doesn't<00:00:46.620> make<00:00:46.680> any

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
really loose if it doesn't make any

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
really loose if it doesn't make any
flapping<00:00:47.280> noise<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.000> hit<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.809> means

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
flapping noise when you hit that means

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
flapping noise when you hit that means
you're<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.469> fast<00:00:49.559> enough<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you're not going fast enough and you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
you're not going fast enough and you
will<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.899> affected<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.440> will

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
will not be affected which I think will

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.750 
will not be affected which I think will
look<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> back<00:00:53.160> end<00:00:53.370> will<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.489> very

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
look just like a back end will be very

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
look just like a back end will be very
slow<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.210> telegraphic<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> hand<00:00:55.800> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
slow and very telegraphic so the hand in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
slow and very telegraphic so the hand in
the<00:00:56.430> wrist<00:00:56.610> must<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.480> loose<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.899> all

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the wrist must be very very loose at all

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
the wrist must be very very loose at all
times<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> look<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.609> really

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
times so if you look at it really really

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
times so if you look at it really really
really<00:00:59.879> relaxed<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> flick<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.620> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
really relaxed so when you flick it it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
really relaxed so when you flick it it's
just<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> barely<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.660> of

the i think is so fast you can't really

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.940 
the i think is so fast you can't really
notice<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.720> he<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.050> looks<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.860> but

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
they hit Bob in the jewels so we have to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.890 
they hit Bob in the jewels so we have to
kind<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.920> restart<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.640> whole<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.780> see

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
kind of restart a whole but you can see

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.850 
kind of restart a whole but you can see
now<00:02:28.019> what<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:28.260> gonna<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.470> I'm<00:02:28.560> gonna<00:02:28.620> play

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.320 
now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play
against<00:02:29.130> two<00:02:29.310> opponents<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> see

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
against two opponents but you can see

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180 
against two opponents but you can see
why<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.660> should<00:02:30.900> use<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> played<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.980> back

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
why you should use the I played the back

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.910 
why you should use the I played the back
end<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.489> very<00:02:32.519> effective<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.510> i<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:34.200> what<00:02:34.650> i

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
end is very effective but i think what i

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.530 
end is very effective but i think what i
did<00:02:35.190> i<00:02:35.519> can<00:02:36.090> hear<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.410> eat<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.700> you
