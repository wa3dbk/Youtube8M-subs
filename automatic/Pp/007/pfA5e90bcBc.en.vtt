00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.980 
properly so all the old MIDI recordings
I<00:01:35.700> did<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.299> worried<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> wasn't

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I did I was really worried that I wasn't

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
I did I was really worried that I wasn't
able<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.409> recover<00:01:37.619> them<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.490> play<00:01:38.670> them<00:01:38.820> again

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
able to recover them to play them again

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539 
able to recover them to play them again
and<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.930> changes<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.619> there's<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and make changes to them there's a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.700 
and make changes to them there's a
little<00:01:41.729> trick<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.240> noticed<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.500> on

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
little trick I noticed if you look on

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.030 
little trick I noticed if you look on
the<00:01:43.950> timeline<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> green<00:01:46.710> bar

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the timeline there is like a green bar

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.620 
the timeline there is like a green bar
that<00:01:47.310> represents<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.880> recording<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.450> MIDI

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that represents a recording of a MIDI

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.109 
that represents a recording of a MIDI
file<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> look<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> left<00:01:50.340> top<00:01:50.820> left

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and I realize that what was happening

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.209 
and I realize that what was happening
was<00:02:15.749> that<00:02:16.219> MIDI<00:02:17.219> recording<00:02:18.030> was<00:02:18.719> muted<00:02:19.439> and<00:02:19.889> it

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
was that MIDI recording was muted and it

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.459 
was that MIDI recording was muted and it
wasn't<00:02:20.430> muted<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:20.939> terms<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.359> track<00:02:21.629> to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
wasn't muted in terms of the track to

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.349 
wasn't muted in terms of the track to
mute<00:02:22.680> something<00:02:23.040> means<00:02:23.249> it<00:02:23.459> makes<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.879> silent

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
mute something means it makes it silent

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.110 
mute something means it makes it silent
and<00:02:24.739> muting<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:25.920> logic<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:26.760> seems<00:02:26.969> like

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and muting in logic it seems like

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.309 
and muting in logic it seems like
there's<00:02:27.329> two<00:02:27.480> different<00:02:27.629> ways<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.079> muting

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
there's two different ways of muting

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.259 
there's two different ways of muting
something<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.189> can<00:02:29.340> mute<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.549> whole<00:02:29.909> track

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
something you can mute the whole track

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.170 
something you can mute the whole track
or<00:02:30.659> if<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.620> select<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.219> MIDI<00:02:32.489> recording<00:02:32.670> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
or if you select that MIDI recording so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.449 
or if you select that MIDI recording so
it<00:02:33.299> selects<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.810> green<00:02:34.019> bar<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.500> hit<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.280> M

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
it selects the green bar and hit the M

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.420 
it selects the green bar and hit the M
key<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.359> toggles<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.469> MIDI<00:02:37.829> performance

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
key it toggles that MIDI performance

muted<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.150> unmuted<00:02:39.689> so<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:41.250> me<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.579> had<00:02:41.819> to

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
muted or unmuted so for me all I had to

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.670 
muted or unmuted so for me all I had to
do<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.209> get<00:02:42.329> my<00:02:42.450> MIDI<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:42.840> play<00:02:42.989> back<00:02:43.200> again<00:02:43.469> was

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
do to get my MIDI to play back again was

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.800 
do to get my MIDI to play back again was
to<00:02:43.889> select<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.519> green<00:02:45.180> bar<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.480> represents

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to select that green bar that represents

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.559 
to select that green bar that represents
the<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.650> MIDI<00:02:47.400> recording<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> timeline

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the the MIDI recording in the timeline

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.050 
the the MIDI recording in the timeline
and<00:02:48.829> because<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:49.980> was<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.099> red<00:02:50.370> circle<00:02:50.609> I<00:02:50.879> hit

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
and because it was a red circle I hit

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.360 
and because it was a red circle I hit
the<00:02:51.209> M<00:02:51.359> key<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> keyboard<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.620> turned<00:02:53.219> it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the M key on the keyboard I turned it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.069 
the M key on the keyboard I turned it
into<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.549> green<00:02:53.790> circle<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.299> let<00:02:54.569> me<00:02:54.719> play<00:02:54.959> it

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
into a green circle and let me play it

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.229 
into a green circle and let me play it
back<00:02:55.139> properly<00:02:55.530> took<00:02:55.889> off<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.219> mute<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:57.060> took

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
back properly took off that mute it took

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.500 
back properly took off that mute it took
off<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.780> mute<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.469> MIDI<00:02:58.709> track<00:02:59.389> so<00:03:00.389> I'm

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
off the mute on that MIDI track so I'm

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.970 
off the mute on that MIDI track so I'm
not<00:03:00.659> sure<00:03:00.719> this<00:03:01.049> there's<00:03:01.319> many<00:03:01.469> reasons<00:03:01.889> why

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
not sure this there's many reasons why

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.979 
not sure this there's many reasons why
you<00:03:02.010> MIDI<00:03:02.310> may<00:03:02.519> not<00:03:02.699> play<00:03:02.939> but<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.810> seems

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
you MIDI may not play but this is seems

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.319 
you MIDI may not play but this is seems
like<00:03:04.199> such<00:03:04.349> an<00:03:04.439> obvious<00:03:04.819> sort<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.879> problem

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
like such an obvious sort of problem

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.270 
like such an obvious sort of problem
with<00:03:06.389> logic<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.079> older<00:03:07.349> version<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.799> logic<00:03:08.099> 8

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
with logic that older version is logic 8

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.020 
with logic that older version is logic 8
or<00:03:08.430> logic<00:03:08.699> 7<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.209> old<00:03:09.389> version<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.959> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
or logic 7 or the old version of it and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.059 
or logic 7 or the old version of it and
I've<00:03:12.030> seen<00:03:12.239> many<00:03:12.510> people<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.019> online<00:03:13.439> forums

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
I've seen many people on online forums

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.490 
I've seen many people on online forums
having<00:03:14.549> an<00:03:14.609> exact<00:03:14.879> same<00:03:15.060> problem<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.689> no<00:03:16.319> one

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
having an exact same problem and no one

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.379 
having an exact same problem and no one
so<00:03:16.680> far<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:16.919> came<00:03:17.159> across<00:03:17.310> has<00:03:17.729> discovered<00:03:18.150> this

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
so far I came across has discovered this

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.780 
so far I came across has discovered this
solution<00:03:18.659> so<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.949> have<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.519> problem

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
solution so if you have this problem

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.520 
solution so if you have this problem
with<00:03:21.030> logic<00:03:21.419> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.900> your<00:03:22.019> MIDI<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.349> play

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
with logic you can get your MIDI to play

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.860 
with logic you can get your MIDI to play
try<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.400> first<00:03:23.729> hit<00:03:24.030> they<00:03:24.180> hit<00:03:24.509> the<00:03:24.629> track

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
try this first hit they hit the track

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.469 
try this first hit they hit the track
and<00:03:25.139> hit<00:03:25.379> select<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.519> little<00:03:26.759> bit<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:26.970> MIDI<00:03:27.180> and

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
and hit select a little bit of MIDI and

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.809 
and hit select a little bit of MIDI and
hit<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.959> M<00:03:28.109> key<00:03:28.409> and<00:03:28.680> see<00:03:28.829> if<00:03:28.949> that<00:03:29.129> red<00:03:29.400> circle

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
hit the M key and see if that red circle
