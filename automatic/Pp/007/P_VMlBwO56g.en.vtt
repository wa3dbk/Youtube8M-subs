00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.730
 Poland has already won the braid 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.630
 built in and win the two 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.280
 santa type inverted that's out right 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.059
 It seems the exchange is missing to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.590
 out 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:27.779
 As for the normal thing that people 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:33.000
 Then you'll pick it up on top of your head and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.350
 divide a kind of circle with the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.350
 strands which has over right 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 comb straight at her stand no 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.320
 wire out of order 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 and divides into three wicks this wick from here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.269
 now I'll make out that image 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 of the environment is as if it were a kind of 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.270
 guide 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.009
 how will I make out she'll be 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.790
 upwards, it goes on the right by 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.190
 under it and left too 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.240
 When you need to walkway to 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.170
 low 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:31.580
 You go down and get another wick. 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:36.149
 feeding the braid and joint and s 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.149
 Now I'm going to pass another one down. 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:48.630
 I passed beneath'll get another 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:50.460
 mecha combs how to be ugly got 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.509
 one two three fingers 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.530
 along with it goes down even 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.530
 thing on the other side 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:19.050
 Going down, take the same mexico. 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 width of the highest joint goes to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.480
 down too, never forgetting 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.910
 feed if you can not always see 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.910
 putting feeding mexico to trade 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.020
 walk here also in this last wick 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.020
 already 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:31.770
 the last and completes the braid with a 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:35.070
 normal braid passes through the three but this 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.770
 because it gives the impression that the 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.920
 braid also highlighted neel looks 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.370
 to be jumping like this coming out of the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.550
 her scalp to look good 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.750
 right here 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.390
 Now we 'll do it. 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.390
 the other one that is more common 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.650
 practically the same way will only change 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.550
 rather the way to transmit these 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.270
 for round top and split practice 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.560
 in three again only this time 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.350
 that mecha of the middle instead of being 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.650
 Up, it's going to stay down. 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.560
 france right in front of her left 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.080
 Also when you go through 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.670
 She's bringing you up now. 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.320
 correct instead of using it down when 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:38.920
 You'll bring it up. 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.920
 the food is also from the bottom up 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.220
 from top to bottom 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.590
 the last 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.090
 and ends braids normally 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.590
 how can you see the difference from that 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.780
 another model is that to win France 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.430
 I was coming out of here no longer 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.650
 It seems she's inside. 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.910
 What stands out are these layers of 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:24.300
 wicks that are on the side of the head 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:26.130
 As you can see on the ipad, the only goal is 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.670
 people who prefer to go out more than 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.050
 I prefer this one, the two beautiful ones. 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.050
 You both like it and you can not understand it.
