00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
are actually also covered with this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.379 
are actually also covered with this
plastic<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.340> reflectors<00:02:01.850> on<00:02:01.999> it<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.270> it

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
plastic and reflectors on it so it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.749 
plastic and reflectors on it so it
doesn't<00:02:02.569> look<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:02.979> institutional<00:02:03.979> most<00:02:04.549> other

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
doesn't look so institutional most other

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.190 
doesn't look so institutional most other
scooters<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.450> market<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:05.990> have<00:02:06.170> a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
scooters on the market just have a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
scooters on the market just have a
straight<00:02:06.590> metal<00:02:06.859> bar<00:02:07.189> there<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.300> actually

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
straight metal bar there so it actually

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.850 
straight metal bar there so it actually
gives<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.900> a<00:02:08.990> little<00:02:09.140> bit<00:02:09.320> sleeker<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.800> a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
gives it a little bit sleeker of a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.640 
gives it a little bit sleeker of a
design<00:02:10.480> so<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.570> break<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.960> apart<00:02:12.020> it's<00:02:12.440> real

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
design so to break it apart it's real

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.980 
design so to break it apart it's real
simple<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.250> lift

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
simple you lift

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.530

front section separated the basket

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.950 
front section separated the basket
disconnects<00:02:45.970> as<00:02:46.120> well<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.790> then<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.510> want<00:02:49.840> to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
disconnects as well and then you want to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.330 
disconnects as well and then you want to
fold<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.710> down<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:52.650> lock<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.890> using<00:02:54.220> this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
fold this down and lock it using this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.760 
fold this down and lock it using this
locking<00:02:54.820> mechanism<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.780> front<00:02:56.050> and
