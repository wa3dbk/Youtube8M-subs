the<00:00:26.609> siege<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.300> warm<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.670> i<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the siege of the warm on and i like to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.220 
the siege of the warm on and i like to
do<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.359> through<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:31.080> there's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
do this on through all because there's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.690 
do this on through all because there's
always<00:00:31.500> packs<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.550> they're

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
always packs of them and they're

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
always packs of them and they're
typically<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> straight<00:00:33.630> line<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
typically in a straight line so it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.350 
typically in a straight line so it's
very<00:00:35.309> easy<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.270> able

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to do this in one go normally it doesn't

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.400 
to do this in one go normally it doesn't
take<00:00:38.640> me<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:39.210> than<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.540> couple<00:00:39.660> minutes<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> do

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
take me more than a couple minutes to do

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.319
