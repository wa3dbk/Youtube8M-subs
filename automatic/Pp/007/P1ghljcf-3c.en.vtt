00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.029
 know those recommendation Thursdays like that 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.500
 I searched and found a place that 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.830
 really liked it because it 's a concept 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.320
 different from juice dallas according to 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.869
 what you need if you want to 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.250
 rejuvenate to hydrate for 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.320
 different things some requirements 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.330
 that you have on the day you are worth 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.170
 to that place so well let's see 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.170
 well what is it about 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.460
 welcome to the juguería the juguería 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.309
 is located in Bogota in the race 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.260
 seventh number 32 12 this is in the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.750
 san martín shopping center in the local 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.850
 412 I thought it was great is the place 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.370
 because it is at a very central point for 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.680
 those people who study in this 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.510
 university area so either the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.520
 lunch or in the morning time of the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.030
 late is perfect 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.340
 terrific homes have either 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.130
 wraps salad juice breakfasts 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.270
 that is the things that they handle in their 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.910
 letter 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.560
 Today I want to focus much more on the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.370
 variety of juices the properties that 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.310
 they have and the vitamins we all know that 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.010
 if we combine a fruit with vegetables 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.350
 we will get a juice pump that is going 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.840
 to help a lot to all our 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.720
 organism so good today we're going to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.210
 focus on the juices here we see some 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 of the juices that the juguería offers 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.910
 has several kinds of always 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.860
 any flavor is good either in water 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.170
 or in milk as you prefer 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.850
 functional and the irresistible we are going to 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.970
 try one of each and let's see what 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.920
 we think about the relationship 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.940
 Value seemed well almost 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.850
 It always seems to me that in places 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.200
 healthy tend to be a bit expensive 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.660
 is found appeared in the prices 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.610
 very fair for how rich is me 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.160
 it seemed fair 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.200
 something that I found super important that 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.600
 I consider it relevant is the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 cleanliness of this place is a very place 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.810
 clean it looks very neat everything has it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.790
 already divided into different ziploc bags 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.490
 so the juices everything gave me a lot 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.520
 confidence against cleaning and use 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.790
 of the products that's a super point to 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.040
 favor 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.849
 the games that we are going to try today are 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.530
 three first one of the always 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.840
 we chose lulo in water 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.810
 all these juices come without sugar but 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.430
 if you want you can add it either 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.189
 Sweetener or organic sugar or sugar 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.829
 normal or good without sugar the other that 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.519
 I chose was that it reduces and the other was 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.010
 delight one to accompany I chose a 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.659
 wrap of pocho I will tell you a 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.849
 little bit that brings every good juice the one 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.769
 cell so we put it in water without sugar 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.590
 all without sugar we found it super rich 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.049
 because it's very creamy and that's the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.900
 true that is very rich then we chose 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.650
 the one that reduce that brings radish eggplant 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.299
 celery orange tree tomato and pineapple 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 super good because the orange and the pineapple 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.989
 they cut the flavor in the vegetables 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.739
 then it is very rich and you are 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.200
 nourishing a lot and the delight one that 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.269
 It was the one that personally more 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.579
 liked it was I do not know the combination I 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.769
 it seemed super rich was the delight one 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.349
 which is mango lulo strawberry peach and 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.530
 delicious tangerine is super 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.910
 recommended 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.319
 As I told you I accompanied him with a 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.530
 big chicken that brought lettuce a 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.050
 little chicken grilled cheese and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.970
 I also found I was super rich 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.280
 liked that the places dearly always 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.290

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.810
