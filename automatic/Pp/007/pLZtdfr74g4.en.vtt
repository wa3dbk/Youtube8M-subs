 the sauteed then we require 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.240
 high frying pan has been 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.869
 heating for about 5 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.440
 1 minute so that it's fine

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.380
 to like it 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 it seems to me a very rich meat has 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.110
 vitamin b3 and that is going to help you 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.060

 decrease and control diabetes as 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.600
 I was telling him and apart the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.660
 protein is wonderful then try 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.010
 to consume turkey breast let's go to 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.010
 put a little salt 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.090
 to our breast and if you can not 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.310
 I would like to use it can also 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.170
 use chicken breast in this 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.410
 saucer without any problem 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.640
 a little more in cooking the breast 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.510
 of chicken will take about three minutes to 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.030
 be about 4 to 6 this 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.970
 depends on the size you have 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.760
 cut the cubes then we're going to 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.910
 give it enough heat to be able to 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.860
 cooking completely is the same as 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.300
 chicken breast we do not have to cook 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.440
 the too much because if it does not dry 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.840
 so we want it to be juicy and 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.900
 delicious 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.140
 already when you see that the breast has 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.190
 opaque tornado and that already took a little 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.190
 colored as caramelized then 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.129
 Well , we're on the right track, look 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.950
 you nikkei kitchen the senses well 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.830
 always awake if you are not 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.870
 listening to this sound 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.380
 is that we are not with the temperature 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.180
 correct it has to be very strong the 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.650
 fire 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.540
 you put too much breast too cold 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.030
 will lower the temperature to the pan 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.209
 then it makes you not put too much 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.849
 that aspect is also important but 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.969
 that the sound is always heard and 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.750
 Frying pan bays is a very good sign 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:07.239
 then add the red pepper 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.930

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.810
