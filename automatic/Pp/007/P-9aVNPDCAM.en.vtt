 we will start and robots a 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.660
 times the dough and gathered not have 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.580

 knead until the dough is 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.900
 homogeneous and nice

 this operation of course we can 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.730
 to make the thinness does not have a robot 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.200
 cover the paw with a clean cloth for 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.860
 let aid for an hour and 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.720
 half and must double in volume for the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.210
 trim will simply mix 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.530
 the ingredients were so has the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.150
 powdered almonds 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.640
 we can replace them with others 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:30.340
 officers like pistachios or 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:30.340
 hazelnuts brown sugar cinnamon 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:43.390
 the water of orange blossom the cream one goes 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.530
 mix to have a preparation 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.540
 pasty 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.860
 but they are not too compact 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.710
 what are we going after the state 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:02:09.820
 will leave the dough and so we have to 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:11.710
 be easy to spread divide the dough into 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.230
 10 portions we will try that this is the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.280
 more equal possible doing more or 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.880
 minus 65 grams each to form 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 small good 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.700
 using a rolling pin you 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.650
 went finely every ladle of dough 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.650
 on a lightly floured surface 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.380
 spread each leg 2 tablespoons 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:45.530
 coffee part of the loan of the filling based 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:48.880
 almonds that we prepared we will roll 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.880
 the dough promoted crest 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.170
 now we folded in half 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.390
 and using a knife 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 we will cut in half, leaving 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.060
 about 2 cm uncut could taste the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.040
 parties make the coc get the form of 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.960
 loose heart and buns on the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.830
 Oven plate made of parchment paper 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.600
 leaving enough space between them 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.080
 we will lick the lifts for 30 to 40 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.080
 minutes 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.520
