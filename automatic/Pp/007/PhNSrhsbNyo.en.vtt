00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.090 

okay<00:00:03.330> well<00:00:03.540> I've<00:00:03.600> been<00:00:03.689> out<00:00:03.810> here<00:00:04.110> playing

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
okay well I've been out here playing

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.290 
okay well I've been out here playing
with<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.430> Kia

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.690 

filter<00:00:13.300> housing<00:00:13.750> I<00:00:14.460> thought<00:00:15.460> there<00:00:15.639> was

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
filter housing I thought there was

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.450 
filter housing I thought there was
something<00:00:16.000> there<00:00:16.180> I<00:00:16.240> could<00:00:16.450> just<00:00:16.630> eliminate

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
something there I could just eliminate

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.609 
something there I could just eliminate
but<00:00:18.460> it<00:00:18.580> was<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.779> completely<00:00:20.260> different

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
but it was it's completely different

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.930 
but it was it's completely different
than<00:00:20.740> what<00:00:20.890> I<00:00:20.950> read<00:00:21.610> online<00:00:21.790> and<00:00:22.140> even<00:00:23.140> the

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
than what I read online and even the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.720 
than what I read online and even the
drawings<00:00:24.940> I<00:00:25.090> saw<00:00:25.440> out<00:00:26.440> of<00:00:26.680> they<00:00:27.250> were<00:00:27.310> scanned

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
drawings I saw out of they were scanned

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.710 
drawings I saw out of they were scanned
from<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.180> actual<00:00:28.740> repair<00:00:29.740> manual<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:30.910> maybe

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
from the actual repair manual so maybe

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.619 
from the actual repair manual so maybe
that's<00:00:31.930> because<00:00:32.080> this<00:00:32.290> truck<00:00:32.619> already<00:00:32.920> had

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
that's because this truck already had

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.850 
that's because this truck already had
that<00:00:34.629> oil<00:00:35.050> cooler<00:00:35.760> adapter<00:00:36.760> delete<00:00:37.590> undo<00:00:38.590> it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
that oil cooler adapter delete undo it

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.650 
that oil cooler adapter delete undo it
and<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.370> now<00:00:39.400> it's<00:00:39.790> it's<00:00:40.090> different<00:00:40.360> than<00:00:40.570> what

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
and so now it's it's different than what

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.380 
and so now it's it's different than what
it<00:00:40.809> originally<00:00:40.899> was<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.620> don't<00:00:41.680> know<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.149> I<00:00:43.180> just

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
it originally was I don't know so I just

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.880 
it originally was I don't know so I just
had<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:43.570> go<00:00:43.780> ahead<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.450> put<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.200> new<00:00:47.350> o-ring<00:00:47.710> and

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
had to go ahead and put a new o-ring and

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.729 
had to go ahead and put a new o-ring and
I<00:00:48.100> used<00:00:48.280> some<00:00:48.430> silicone<00:00:49.290> sealant<00:00:50.290> around<00:00:50.410> it

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
I used some silicone sealant around it

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.139 
I used some silicone sealant around it
to<00:00:50.860> make<00:00:51.010> sure<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.250> stays<00:00:52.149> seal<00:00:52.420> this<00:00:52.630> time<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
to make sure it stays seal this time and

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.139 
to make sure it stays seal this time and
I<00:00:55.480> got<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:55.780> little<00:00:56.579> emissions<00:00:57.579> canister

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
I got this little emissions canister

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:07.460 
I got this little emissions canister
replaced

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.400 

well<00:01:08.390> hard<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:13.050> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
well hard to see but the you can see the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.960 
well hard to see but the you can see the
oil<00:01:13.560> cooler<00:01:14.160> I<00:01:14.220> repaired<00:01:14.730> it<00:01:14.910> I<00:01:15.590> just<00:01:16.970> replace

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
oil cooler I repaired it I just replace

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
oil cooler I repaired it I just replace
the<00:01:18.180> lot<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.510> section<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.110> some<00:01:19.290> new<00:01:19.470> tubing

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the lot in section with some new tubing

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.960 
the lot in section with some new tubing
and<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.720> used<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.020> rubber<00:01:22.290> hose<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:23.040> join<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and I used some rubber hose to join it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
and I used some rubber hose to join it
together<00:01:24.120> then<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.690> painted<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> whole<00:01:25.290> thing

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
together then I painted the whole thing

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.750 
together then I painted the whole thing
up<00:01:26.210> hopefully<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.270> doesn't<00:01:27.330> rust<00:01:27.690> anymore<00:01:28.760> so

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
up hopefully it doesn't rust anymore so

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.910 
up hopefully it doesn't rust anymore so
that's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.180> leaking<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:34.260> four-wheel<00:01:34.650> drive

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that's not leaking the four-wheel drive

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.540 
that's not leaking the four-wheel drive
is<00:01:35.130> working<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> engine<00:01:37.680> light<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> off<00:01:38.220> now

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
is working the engine light is off now

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.810 
is working the engine light is off now
that<00:01:38.580> I've<00:01:38.930> replaced<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.820> emissions

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that I've replaced that little emissions

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.180 
that I've replaced that little emissions
canister<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.650> turned<00:01:46.650> out<00:01:46.830> pretty<00:01:46.950> good

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
canister so it's turned out pretty good

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.160

boosts whatever that means yeah it's uh
it's<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.260> fine<00:02:28.560> running<00:02:29.370> beautifully

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.680 

no<00:02:38.200> more<00:02:38.440> no<00:02:39.280> more<00:02:39.310> all<00:02:39.610> weeks<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.300> before<00:02:40.420> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
no more no more all weeks and before it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.100 
no more no more all weeks and before it
would<00:02:40.840> leak<00:02:40.990> through<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:42.280> its<00:02:42.550> oil<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.110> I'd

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
would leak through all its oil and I'd

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.480 
would leak through all its oil and I'd
say<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.740> half<00:02:44.980> hour<00:02:45.220> running<00:02:47.190> sharp<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.430> car

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
say a half hour running sharp little car

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.900 
say a half hour running sharp little car
all<00:02:51.490> right<00:02:51.670> well<00:02:51.880> that's<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.630> for<00:02:52.810> now
