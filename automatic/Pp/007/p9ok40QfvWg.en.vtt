starts I just wanna point out eggs are
great<00:00:14.700> things<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.059> draw<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.570> they're

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
great things to draw because they're

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.680 
great things to draw because they're
white<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.920> very<00:00:17.340> easy<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> see<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> shading

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
white it's very easy to see the shading

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.170 
white it's very easy to see the shading
that<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.680> along<00:00:19.890> them<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.060> even

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that is going along them you can even

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720 
that is going along them you can even
see<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> nice<00:00:21.660> cast<00:00:22.020> shadow<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.039> side<00:00:23.310> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
see a nice cast shadow on this side and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
see a nice cast shadow on this side and
I'm<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.180> show<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.660> simple<00:00:25.109> technique

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
I'm going to show you a simple technique

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
I'm going to show you a simple technique
where<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.189> use<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> tissue<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.880> shade<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
where you use a tissue to shade it and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.599 
where you use a tissue to shade it and
it<00:00:28.320> will<00:00:28.470> make<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:28.949> instead<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.369> flat

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it will make it look instead of flat

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.400 
it will make it look instead of flat
it'll<00:00:29.820> make<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.210> 3d<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> want<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
it'll make it look 3d do you want to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.319 
it'll make it look 3d do you want to
start<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.769> by<00:00:31.800> drawing<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.520> shape<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.180> your

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
start out by drawing this shape of your

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.010 
start out by drawing this shape of your
egg<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.980> side<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.489> pretty<00:00:35.850> round<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.840> then

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
egg so one side is pretty round and then

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
egg so one side is pretty round and then
the<00:00:37.110> other<00:00:37.290> side<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.950> comes<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> little

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the other side it just comes to a little

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.740 
the other side it just comes to a little
bit<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.420> smaller<00:00:40.379> point<00:00:41.030> my<00:00:42.030> egg<00:00:42.390> has<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
bit of a a smaller point my egg has a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.040 
bit of a a smaller point my egg has a
cast<00:00:43.110> shadow<00:00:43.820> back<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.809> shadow

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
cast shadow back here or just a shadow

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
cast shadow back here or just a shadow
from<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.440> lighting<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.280> I'm<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
from my lighting so I'm just going to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.630 
from my lighting so I'm just going to
shade<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:49.730> quickly<00:00:51.710> much<00:00:52.710> darker<00:00:53.370> than<00:00:53.399> my

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
shade it in quickly much darker than my

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
shade it in quickly much darker than my
egg

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100 

let<00:01:05.500> me<00:01:05.620> just<00:01:05.800> made<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.760> kinda<00:01:07.150> then<00:01:07.990> you're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
let me just made that kinda then you're

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.040 
let me just made that kinda then you're
gonna<00:01:08.230> take<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.740> tissue<00:01:09.130> fold<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.300> in<00:01:10.480> half<00:01:10.510> and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
gonna take a tissue fold it in half and

gonna take a tissue fold it in half and
put<00:01:11.140> your<00:01:11.620> finger<00:01:11.950> inside<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.950> do

put your finger inside of it and you do

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.770 
put your finger inside of it and you do
this<00:01:15.310> because<00:01:15.640> if<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.000> touch<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.510> with<00:01:16.540> your

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
want to do that so just going in circles

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.440 
want to do that so just going in circles
I<00:01:29.650> have<00:01:29.980> my<00:01:30.160> cast<00:01:30.400> shadow<00:01:30.730> I<00:01:30.850> need<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.270> rub

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
I have my cast shadow I need to just rub

I have my cast shadow I need to just rub
it<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.690> little<00:01:31.840> bit<00:01:32.020> more<00:01:32.550> then<00:01:33.550> since<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.940> when<00:01:34.720> I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
it a little bit more then since I when I

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.870 
it a little bit more then since I when I
was<00:01:34.900> smudging<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.410> lost<00:01:35.650> some<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.100> my<00:01:36.280> lines<00:01:36.520> so

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
was smudging I lost some of my lines so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.030 
was smudging I lost some of my lines so
just<00:01:37.060> come<00:01:37.270> back<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.660> put<00:01:38.620> your<00:01:38.650> lines<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
then I'm just gonna erase out that cast

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.960 
then I'm just gonna erase out that cast
shadow<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.820> was<00:01:48.970> there<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.460> reflection

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
shadow that was there with a reflection

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.960 
shadow that was there with a reflection
from<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> table
