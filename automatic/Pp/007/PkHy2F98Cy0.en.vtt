were about 25 bucks each and the way

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.560 
were about 25 bucks each and the way
that<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.670> tell<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.970> they're<00:01:06.150> original

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that you can tell if they're original

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
that you can tell if they're original
movie<00:01:06.780> posters<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.530> copies<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
movie posters and not copies is that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.039 
movie posters and not copies is that
they're<00:01:08.729> double-sided<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.900> have

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
they're double-sided and so they have

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.020 
they're double-sided and so they have
the<00:01:10.170> same<00:01:10.320> image<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.740> both<00:01:10.979> sides<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.850> is
