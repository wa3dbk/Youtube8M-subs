 Hi everyone This is Champagne J. In this video Im going to show you how to t use eyeliner. 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.960
 Lets start. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.900
 Angle brush 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 What I usually do is, I disperse eyeliner into parts 2. I like to draw from the outer corner 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 Go inside right in the middle and then I would draw from coming from inside and join my lines to each 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.820
 together. Draw a line as the whole tray is a bit tricky and do it on this road 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.710
 We have more control over the liner. The good thing about using a gel lining is that it 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 Easy to control and you can build a line so if you want a thicker line you can only 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 Go over. You can then repeat this eye on the other hand. 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.010
 With this we do. I've used gel eyeliner for this tutorial but you can also use a pencil 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.250
 Or liquid lining. The difference between using a pencil, a liquid and a gel is that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.860
 The pencil is easy to control but we may get thicker lines we might not want. Liquid 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 Linen is the most difficult way to control, so I personally like the best gel lining. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 This is Champagne J. Thanks for watching.
