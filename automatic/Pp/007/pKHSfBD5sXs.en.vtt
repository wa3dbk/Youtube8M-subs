to free move the carriage and we've got
to<00:01:38.229> encroach<00:01:38.500> after<00:01:38.979> a<00:01:39.040> bit<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.310> first<00:01:39.520> one

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
to encroach after a bit the first one

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.760 
to encroach after a bit the first one
and<00:01:40.420> we've<00:01:40.600> got<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.869> fact<00:01:41.350> when<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.619> just

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
and we've got the fact when you just

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.749 
and we've got the fact when you just
place<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.530> reason<00:01:44.860> for<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.009> ease<00:01:45.250> so

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
place a so the reason for that ease so

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.630 
place a so the reason for that ease so
we're<00:01:46.180> gonna<00:01:46.360> attempt<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.110> clean<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.460> two

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
we're gonna attempt to clean the two

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.149 
we're gonna attempt to clean the two
chrome<00:01:48.880> shops<00:01:49.210> first<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.470> then<00:01:50.740> put<00:01:50.979> some

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
chrome shops first and then put some

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.800 
chrome shops first and then put some
pressure<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:51.820> after<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.539> what<00:01:52.689> you're

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
pressure on and after and what you're

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.649 
pressure on and after and what you're
cleaning<00:01:53.020> off<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.409> over<00:01:54.070> spray<00:01:54.340> ink<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.149> a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
cleaning off is over spray ink and a

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.600 
cleaning off is over spray ink and a
build-up<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.170> dust<00:01:56.440> over<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.950> period<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.429> long

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
build-up the dust over the period a long

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.109 
build-up the dust over the period a long
time

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
time

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.130 
time
and<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.590> reason<00:01:59.950> why<00:02:00.069> we<00:02:00.250> do<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.940> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.770 

reason<00:02:05.140> why<00:02:05.259> we<00:02:05.380> do<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.600> reduce<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
reason why we do this is to reduce the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.789 
reason why we do this is to reduce the
friction<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.959> make<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> printer<00:02:11.590> run<00:02:11.769> a

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
friction and so make the printer run a

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.309 
friction and so make the printer run a
lot<00:02:12.010> freer<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:15.840> doing<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.230> obviously

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
lot freer and doing this but obviously

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.670 
lot freer and doing this but obviously
we're<00:02:18.690> gonna<00:02:19.690> increase<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.200> life<00:02:20.380> for<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
we're gonna increase the life for the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.840 
we're gonna increase the life for the
carriage<00:02:20.980> valve<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.860> also<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.489> carriage

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
carriage valve and also the carriage

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.390 
carriage valve and also the carriage
motor<00:02:26.519> or<00:02:27.519> feeding<00:02:28.890> repair<00:02:29.890> each<00:02:30.010> unit<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
motor or feeding repair each unit and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.340 
motor or feeding repair each unit and
also<00:02:33.400> doing<00:02:33.880> this

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
also doing this

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.130 
also doing this
it's<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.500> plaintiff<00:02:36.070> maintenance<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:38.109> keep

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
it's a plaintiff maintenance to keep

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's a plaintiff maintenance to keep

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
as you see I'm using the one I've

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:35.860 
as you see I'm using the one I've
modified<00:03:28.180> no<00:03:33.850> I'll<00:03:34.850> show<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.360> one<00:03:35.840> that

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
modified no I'll show you the one that

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
comes we have it got longer and I should

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.730 
comes we have it got longer and I should
slide<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.240> into<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.810> internal<00:03:42.380> part<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.650> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
bolts they do go like a pinky call that

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.120 
bolts they do go like a pinky call that
and<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.790> can<00:04:55.910> see<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.150> teeth<00:04:56.780> chewing<00:04:57.170> up<00:04:57.440> so

and you can see the teeth chewing up so

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.640 
and you can see the teeth chewing up so
you<00:04:58.190> can<00:04:58.280> go<00:04:58.460> along<00:04:58.700> and<00:04:59.000> inspect<00:04:59.390> about<00:04:59.660> all

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
you can go along and inspect about all

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.330 
you can go along and inspect about all
the<00:05:00.830> way<00:05:00.920> along<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:02.710> normally<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:04.190> around

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
the way along and normally it's around

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.700 
the way along and normally it's around
an<00:05:04.640> area<00:05:04.880> what<00:05:05.690> works<00:05:05.990> around<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.290> mostly

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
an area what works around the mostly

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.210 
an area what works around the mostly
most<00:05:07.160> of<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.400> most<00:05:08.440> then<00:05:09.440> you<00:05:09.560> can<00:05:09.740> expect<00:05:10.100> it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
most of the most then you can expect it

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.210 
most of the most then you can expect it
all<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.430> way<00:05:10.550> along<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:12.710> can<00:05:12.860> decide<00:05:13.190> if

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
all the way along and you can decide if
