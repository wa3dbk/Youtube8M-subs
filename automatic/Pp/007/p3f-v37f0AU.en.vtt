hey<00:00:01.140> everyone<00:00:01.439> seagull<00:00:01.920> 11<00:00:02.220> again<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.540> was

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hey everyone seagull 11 again and I was

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey everyone seagull 11 again and I was
messing<00:00:03.990> around<00:00:04.170> with<00:00:04.500> my<00:00:04.790> tutorial<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:05.910> I

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
messing around with my tutorial that I

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.519 
messing around with my tutorial that I
made<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> other<00:00:06.420> day<00:00:06.540> on<00:00:06.899> random<00:00:07.350> ball

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
made the other day on random ball

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.350 
made the other day on random ball
movement<00:00:07.770> was<00:00:08.670> trying<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> get<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.179> movement

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
movement was trying to get the movement

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.379 
movement was trying to get the movement
to<00:00:09.599> look<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.019> smoother<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.000> what<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> was

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
to look a little smoother and what I was

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.760 
to look a little smoother and what I was
doing<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.860> making<00:00:14.340> its<00:00:15.179> slow<00:00:15.540> down

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
doing was just making its slow down

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.960 
doing was just making its slow down
slowly<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.220> last<00:00:17.430> few<00:00:17.699> frames<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:19.970> each

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
slowly the last few frames of each

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.250 
slowly the last few frames of each
movement<00:00:21.270> cycle<00:00:22.189> but<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.689> was<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.050> not

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
movement cycle but I was I was not

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.019 
movement cycle but I was I was not
getting<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.830> effect<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.340> i<00:00:26.490> wanted<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.000> i

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
getting the effect that i wanted so i

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.589 
getting the effect that i wanted so i
decided<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:27.779> i<00:00:29.090> decided<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.210> scrap

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
decided to just i decided to just scrap

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.160 
decided to just i decided to just scrap
that<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.109> completely<00:00:32.009> rewrite<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.170> this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that and completely rewrite it and this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.069 
that and completely rewrite it and this
is<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.500> i<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.450> show<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> real

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
is what i got so show this to you real

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
is what i got so show this to you real
quick<00:00:37.670> um<00:00:39.620> first<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.860> i<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
quick um first of all i have the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
quick um first of all i have the
uiimageview<00:00:42.510> ball<00:00:42.989> i<00:00:43.260> took<00:00:44.010> care<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
uiimageview ball i took care of the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.110 
uiimageview ball i took care of the
property<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.899> memory<00:00:46.230> stuff

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
property with and the memory stuff

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.119 
property with and the memory stuff
exactly<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> same<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> other<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.410> i

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
exactly the same as the other one and i

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
exactly the same as the other one and i
added<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.180> view<00:00:51.360> controller<00:00:51.500> just<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
added it to the view controller just the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
added it to the view controller just the
same<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:54.440> then<00:00:55.440> i<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.129> cgpoint<00:00:56.940> target

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
same and then i have a cgpoint target

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.709 
same and then i have a cgpoint target
and<00:00:57.660> cgpoint<00:00:58.289> ball<00:00:58.530> velocity<00:00:59.120> ball<00:01:00.120> velocity

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and cgpoint ball velocity ball velocity

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
and cgpoint ball velocity ball velocity
is<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> same<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.800> wasn't<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> other

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
is just the same as it wasn't the other

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.390 
is just the same as it wasn't the other
one<00:01:04.220> cgpoint<00:01:05.220> target<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:07.100> what<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.220> going

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
one cgpoint target is what we're going

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.210 
one cgpoint target is what we're going
to<00:01:08.549> use<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:10.200> position<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.040> will

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
to use to as a position that we will

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.640 
to use to as a position that we will
move<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> ball<00:01:11.850> towards<00:01:12.380> instead<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> just

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
move the ball towards instead of just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.350 
move the ball towards instead of just
moving<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.189> ball<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.650> amount<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.830> time

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
moving the ball for a amount of time

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.850 
moving the ball for a amount of time
we'll<00:01:18.360> set<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.810> position<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> we're<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
we'll set a position that we're going to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.910 
we'll set a position that we're going to
move<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> ball<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.840> calculate<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
move the ball to and then calculate the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.999 
move the ball to and then calculate the
velocity<00:01:23.600> based<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> position<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
velocity based on the position of the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
velocity based on the position of the
ball<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.119> position<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.810> trying

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
ball and the position that we're trying

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.109 
ball and the position that we're trying
to<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:30.030> an<00:01:30.180> nsinteger

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
to get to then I have an nsinteger

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.440 
to get to then I have an nsinteger
deceleration<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:35.450> something

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
deceleration and this is just something

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.330 
deceleration and this is just something
that<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.869> changed<00:01:36.990> however<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that can be changed however we want it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
that can be changed however we want it
to<00:01:38.610> get<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> deceleration<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.950> right

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to get the deceleration to the right

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
to get the deceleration to the right
speed<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.130> along<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> follow

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
speed so I like to go along and follow

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.350 
speed so I like to go along and follow
along<00:01:48.869> how<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.320> code<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> execute

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
along how the code is going to execute

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.530 
along how the code is going to execute
when<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.450> trying<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.869> how<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> works<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
when I'm trying to see how it works so

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.719 
when I'm trying to see how it works so
entry<00:01:54.540> point<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:56.250> code<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> I've

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
entry point to the code that I've

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
entry point to the code that I've
written<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> here

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
written here is going to be up in here

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.480 
written here is going to be up in here
if<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:59.119> viewdidload<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> set

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
if you do viewdidload so set

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.929 
if you do viewdidload so set
deceleration<00:02:03.360> decay<00:02:03.659> normal<00:02:04.310> which<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.579> made

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
deceleration decay normal which I made

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.570 
deceleration decay normal which I made
these<00:02:06.090> three<00:02:06.390> defines<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.930> here<00:02:07.310> for<00:02:08.310> slow

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
these three defines up here for slow

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.050 
these three defines up here for slow
normal<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> fast<00:02:09.470> depending<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.560> how<00:02:11.060> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
normal and fast depending on how you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.280 
normal and fast depending on how you
want<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.870> ball

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
want the ball

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.250 
want the ball
to<00:02:13.439> sell<00:02:13.680> right<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> set<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.420> normal<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:16.110> I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
to sell right so I set to normal then I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.589 
to sell right so I set to normal then I
call<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.950> random<00:02:17.310> target<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.390> function

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
call get random target which is function

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.199 
call get random target which is function
I<00:02:18.870> made<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.659> here<00:02:22.939> what<00:02:23.939> this<00:02:24.060> is

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
I made and it is right here what this is

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.000 
I made and it is right here what this is
going<00:02:24.359> to<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:25.019> us<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.230> random<00:02:25.650> number

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
going to do is get us a random number

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.420 
going to do is get us a random number
that<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.519> somewhere<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:28.200> screen<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:29.250> it's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that is somewhere on the screen but it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.970 
that is somewhere on the screen but it's
10<00:02:29.670> pixels<00:02:30.120> away<00:02:30.329> from<00:02:30.569> each<00:02:30.689> side<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:31.829> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
10 pixels away from each side we do that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.979 
10 pixels away from each side we do that
by<00:02:32.189> getting<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.579> width<00:02:32.790> minus<00:02:33.239> 20<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
by getting the width minus 20 and the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.830 
by getting the width minus 20 and the
height<00:02:34.200> minus<00:02:34.439> 20<00:02:35.150> then<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> random

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
height minus 20 then we get a random

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.960 
height minus 20 then we get a random
number<00:02:37.079> between<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.980> width<00:02:38.189> and<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.549> height

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
number between the width and the height

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.410 
number between the width and the height
and<00:02:39.359> we<00:02:39.689> add<00:02:39.840> 10<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.230> each<00:02:40.439> of<00:02:40.620> those<00:02:40.709> numbers

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and we add 10 to each of those numbers

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.819 
and we add 10 to each of those numbers
and<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:43.409> way<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.969> number<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
and that way we have a number that is

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.619 
and that way we have a number that is
greater<00:02:47.959> than<00:02:48.959> 10<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.829> 10<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:51.000> greater<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
greater than 10 it is 10 or greater and

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.080 
greater than 10 it is 10 or greater and
it<00:02:52.439> is<00:02:53.329> more<00:02:54.329> than<00:02:54.510> 10<00:02:55.370> 10<00:02:56.370> or<00:02:56.519> more<00:02:56.700> pixels

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
it is more than 10 10 or more pixels

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.780 
it is more than 10 10 or more pixels
away<00:02:57.389> from<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.750> other<00:02:57.900> side<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.409> screen

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
away from the other side of the screen

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.360 
away from the other side of the screen
so<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.180> stays<00:03:00.870> away<00:03:01.139> from<00:03:01.169> the<00:03:01.409> edges<00:03:04.129> so<00:03:05.129> then

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
so it stays away from the edges so then

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.069 
so it stays away from the edges so then
after<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.510> we've<00:03:06.989> started<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.730> timer<00:03:09.079> this

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
after this we've started the timer this

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.599 
after this we've started the timer this
right<00:03:10.319> here<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.650> same<00:03:10.950> time<00:03:11.159> or<00:03:11.340> call<00:03:11.489> i've

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
right here is the same time or call i've

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.659 
right here is the same time or call i've
been<00:03:11.819> using<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.569> all<00:03:12.689> my<00:03:12.810> tutorials<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.669> we

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
been using and all my tutorials and we

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:20.629 
been using and all my tutorials and we
start<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> game<00:03:15.209> loop<00:03:16.370> as<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.810> note<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:19.639> the

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
start the game loop as a note here the

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.210 
start the game loop as a note here the
game<00:03:21.389> loop<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.810> way<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.229> I<00:03:22.260> got<00:03:22.709> most<00:03:22.979> this

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
game loop the way that I got most this

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.629 
game loop the way that I got most this
code<00:03:23.519> was<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> book<00:03:26.340> called

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
code was I have a book called

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.969 
code was I have a book called
programming<00:03:27.419> game<00:03:27.629> AI<00:03:27.810> by<00:03:28.139> example<00:03:28.500> by<00:03:28.769> Matt

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.149 
programming game AI by example by Matt
Buckland<00:03:29.780> it's<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.079> great<00:03:31.290> book<00:03:31.530> not

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
Buckland it's a really great book not

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.330 
Buckland it's a really great book not
for<00:03:32.370> beginners<00:03:32.599> but<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.870> has<00:03:34.079> some<00:03:34.979> great

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
for beginners but it has some great

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.960 
for beginners but it has some great
things<00:03:35.579> in<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.909> like<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:37.400> used<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> code<00:03:38.729> from

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
things in it like I used the code from

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.580 
things in it like I used the code from
his<00:03:39.209> function<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:39.900> there<00:03:40.049> called<00:03:40.530> arrived<00:03:40.859> and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
his function in there called arrived and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.759 
his function in there called arrived and
it<00:03:43.590> was<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:43.919> C++<00:03:44.639> but<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> kind<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.680> changed<00:03:46.680> it

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
it was in C++ but I kind of changed it

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.039 
it was in C++ but I kind of changed it
up<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.129> bit<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.579> got<00:03:48.419> it<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.599> work<00:03:48.780> for

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
up a little bit and got it to work for

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.360 
up a little bit and got it to work for
this<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:51.319> basically<00:03:52.319> what<00:03:53.010> we're<00:03:53.159> going<00:03:53.280> to

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
this but basically what we're going to

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.750 
this but basically what we're going to
do<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:54.139> we<00:03:55.139> get<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.409> distance<00:03:55.769> between<00:03:56.040> target

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
do is we get the distance between target

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.839 
do is we get the distance between target
and<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.359> ball<00:03:57.540> position<00:03:57.979> by<00:03:58.979> taking<00:03:59.459> each<00:03:59.639> of

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
and the ball position by taking each of

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.520 
and the ball position by taking each of
the<00:03:59.939> coordinates<00:04:00.389> taking<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.870> target<00:04:01.319> X

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
the coordinates taking the target X

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.179 
the coordinates taking the target X
minus<00:04:01.979> the<00:04:02.459> ball<00:04:02.639> X<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.689> target<00:04:04.650> y<00:04:04.829> minus<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
minus the ball X and target y minus the

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.390 
minus the ball X and target y minus the
ball<00:04:05.430> why<00:04:06.079> then<00:04:07.079> we<00:04:07.229> get<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.470> distance<00:04:08.129> as<00:04:08.370> a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
ball why then we get the distance as a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.890 
ball why then we get the distance as a
double<00:04:08.760> value<00:04:09.199> by<00:04:10.199> getting<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:11.509> the<00:04:12.509> square

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
double value by getting the the square

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.530 
double value by getting the the square
root<00:04:13.229> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> squares<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.759> differences

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
root of the squares of the differences

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.409 
root of the squares of the differences
if<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.229> makes<00:04:16.409> any<00:04:16.470> sense<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.209> we<00:04:18.209> use

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
if that makes any sense to you we use

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.360 
if that makes any sense to you we use
the<00:04:20.150> Pythagorean<00:04:21.150> theorem

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
the Pythagorean theorem

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.550 
the Pythagorean theorem
to<00:04:23.370> make<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> triangle<00:04:24.390> in<00:04:24.870> our<00:04:25.470> code<00:04:25.710> there

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
to make a triangle in our code there

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.970 
to make a triangle in our code there
here's<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.620> function<00:04:29.070> we're<00:04:29.190> calling<00:04:29.720> but

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
here's the function we're calling but

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.820 
here's the function we're calling but
this<00:04:31.980> function<00:04:32.580> basically<00:04:33.270> we're<00:04:34.050> just<00:04:34.080> doing

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
this function basically we're just doing

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.380 
this function basically we're just doing
the<00:04:34.920> math<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.340> Pythagorean<00:04:35.940> theorem<00:04:36.300> to

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
the math and the Pythagorean theorem to

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.990 
the math and the Pythagorean theorem to
get<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.920> distance<00:04:40.640> once<00:04:41.640> we<00:04:41.790> get<00:04:41.880> the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
get the distance once we get the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.160 
get the distance once we get the
distance<00:04:42.420> if<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:44.000> greater<00:04:45.000> than<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.630> tenth

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
distance if it is greater than a tenth

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.300 
distance if it is greater than a tenth
of<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.440> pixel<00:04:47.180> then<00:04:48.180> we're<00:04:48.780> going<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.310> continue

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
of a pixel then we're going to continue

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.040 
of a pixel then we're going to continue
figuring<00:04:51.060> out<00:04:51.270> how<00:04:51.420> we<00:04:51.480> want<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.810> move<00:04:51.900> the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
figuring out how we want to move the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.780 
figuring out how we want to move the
ball<00:04:52.250> otherwise<00:04:53.250> we<00:04:53.760> just<00:04:53.790> set<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:55.760> get<00:04:56.760> a

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
ball otherwise we just set it to a get a

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.890 
ball otherwise we just set it to a get a
random<00:04:57.060> target<00:04:57.540> again<00:04:57.630> which<00:04:58.230> will<00:04:58.410> start<00:04:58.740> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
random target again which will start the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.430 
random target again which will start the
cycle<00:05:00.900> over<00:05:01.440> again<00:05:01.470> starting<00:05:02.100> down<00:05:02.250> here<00:05:03.440> but

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
cycle over again starting down here but

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.100 
cycle over again starting down here but
if<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:05.430> distance<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:06.030> greater<00:05:06.240> than<00:05:06.600> 0<00:05:06.840> point

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
if the distance is greater than 0 point

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.310 
if the distance is greater than 0 point
one<00:05:07.580> then<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.820> set<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.180> deceleration<00:05:09.780> tweaker

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
one then we set the deceleration tweaker

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.260 
one then we set the deceleration tweaker
which<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.070> just<00:05:11.220> another<00:05:11.550> number<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:11.970> you

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
which is just another number that you

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.050 
which is just another number that you
can<00:05:12.300> mess<00:05:12.630> with<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:14.340> was<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.730> number

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
can mess with and that was the number

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.480 
can mess with and that was the number
that<00:05:15.360> i<00:05:15.450> felt<00:05:15.840> worked<00:05:16.650> best<00:05:18.920> we<00:05:19.920> calculate<00:05:20.370> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
that i felt worked best we calculate the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.490 
that i felt worked best we calculate the
speed<00:05:20.760> by<00:05:20.970> taking<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.360> distance<00:05:21.840> over<00:05:22.380> the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
speed by taking a distance over the

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.440 
speed by taking a distance over the
deceleration<00:05:23.250> times<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.910> deceleration

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
deceleration times the deceleration

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.710 
deceleration times the deceleration
tweaker<00:05:25.490> we<00:05:26.490> make<00:05:26.670> sure<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.030> speed<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:27.540> not

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
tweaker we make sure the speed is not

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.760 
tweaker we make sure the speed is not
greater<00:05:28.050> than<00:05:28.170> 10<00:05:28.530> if<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.890> is<00:05:29.070> we<00:05:29.280> set<00:05:29.310> it<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.790> 10

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
greater than 10 if it is we set it to 10

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.790 
greater than 10 if it is we set it to 10
we<00:05:31.770> get<00:05:32.390> we<00:05:33.390> take<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:34.170> distance<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.740> the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
we get we take the distance to the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.830 
we get we take the distance to the
target<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.340> x<00:05:36.060> speed<00:05:36.860> we<00:05:37.860> then<00:05:38.210> take<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.270> and

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
target and x speed we then take that and

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.340 
target and x speed we then take that and
we<00:05:40.260> divide<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.770> by<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.890> distance<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:42.170> that<00:05:43.170> is

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
we divide it by the distance and that is

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.440 
we divide it by the distance and that is
our<00:05:43.500> desired<00:05:43.920> velocity<00:05:44.130> which<00:05:44.670> we<00:05:44.850> set<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.300> the

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
our desired velocity which we set to the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.660 
our desired velocity which we set to the
ball<00:05:45.600> velocity<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:47.120> then<00:05:48.140> every<00:05:49.140> frame

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
ball velocity and then every frame

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.070 
ball velocity and then every frame
obviously<00:05:50.670> we<00:05:51.000> take<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.300> ball<00:05:51.480> center<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
obviously we take the ball center and

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.230 
obviously we take the ball center and
set<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.590> to<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.800> ball<00:05:52.980> center<00:05:53.460> plus<00:05:53.970> the

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
set it to the ball center plus the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.570 
set it to the ball center plus the
velocity<00:05:56.240> so<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.680> little<00:05:58.680> bit<00:05:58.830> confusing<00:05:59.280> math

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
velocity so a little bit confusing math

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.090 
velocity so a little bit confusing math
here<00:06:00.060> I'm<00:06:00.570> not<00:06:00.930> necessarily<00:06:01.500> sure<00:06:01.710> how<00:06:01.890> it<00:06:02.010> all

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
here I'm not necessarily sure how it all

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.290 
here I'm not necessarily sure how it all
works<00:06:02.370> out<00:06:02.900> but<00:06:03.900> does<00:06:04.170> it<00:06:04.700> creates<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.970> pretty

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
works out but does it creates a pretty

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.680 
works out but does it creates a pretty
nice<00:06:06.480> fact<00:06:07.610> frame<00:06:08.610> rates<00:06:08.820> a<00:06:08.940> little<00:06:08.970> low<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.360> it

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
nice fact frame rates a little low so it

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.350 
nice fact frame rates a little low so it
might<00:06:09.840> seem<00:06:10.140> a<00:06:10.170> little<00:06:10.320> choppier<00:06:10.860> but<00:06:11.240> for<00:06:12.240> me

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
might seem a little choppier but for me

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.030 
might seem a little choppier but for me
it<00:06:12.480> looks<00:06:12.630> really<00:06:12.870> smooth<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:13.470> nice<00:06:13.590> here<00:06:13.950> and

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
it looks really smooth and nice here and

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.830 
it looks really smooth and nice here and
so<00:06:17.040> I<00:06:17.280> like<00:06:17.580> this<00:06:17.730> fact<00:06:20.120> again<00:06:21.120> I<00:06:21.360> know<00:06:21.480> this

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
so I like this fact again I know this

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.750 
so I like this fact again I know this
was<00:06:22.020> kind<00:06:22.350> of<00:06:22.470> confusing<00:06:22.980> I<00:06:23.160> didn't<00:06:23.430> explain<00:06:23.700> a

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
was kind of confusing I didn't explain a

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.000 
was kind of confusing I didn't explain a
whole<00:06:23.970> lot<00:06:24.150> but<00:06:25.910> if<00:06:26.910> you<00:06:27.060> have<00:06:27.150> any<00:06:27.300> questions

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
whole lot but if you have any questions
