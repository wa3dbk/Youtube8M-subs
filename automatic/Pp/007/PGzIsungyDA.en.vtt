00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
launch as to what are the inspiration

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.450 
launch as to what are the inspiration
behind<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.020> define<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.920> design<00:01:48.220> theme

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
behind how we define the design theme

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.900 
behind how we define the design theme
for<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.700> vehicle<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.479> then<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.259> have<00:01:50.470> four

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
for this vehicle and then you have four

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.029 
for this vehicle and then you have four
SUVs<00:01:51.910> in<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.360> market<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:53.500> becomes<00:01:53.830> very

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
SUVs in the market it becomes very

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.669 
SUVs in the market it becomes very
difficult<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.819> pick<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.390> list<00:01:55.720> which<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.259> not

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
difficult to pick a list which is not

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.440 
difficult to pick a list which is not
covered<00:01:57.130> by<00:01:57.460> something<00:01:57.700> else<00:01:57.970> which<00:01:58.270> will

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
covered by something else which will

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.840 
covered by something else which will
something<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:58.840> will<00:01:59.050> create<00:01:59.170> its<00:01:59.500> own

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
something that will create its own

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.950 
something that will create its own
purchase<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.030> spending<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.600> market

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
purchase and spending in the market

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.499 
purchase and spending in the market
something<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.410> will<00:02:02.560> not<00:02:03.149> cannibalize<00:02:04.179> our

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
something that will not cannibalize our

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.960 
something that will not cannibalize our
own<00:02:04.810> products<00:02:05.319> and<00:02:05.709> therefore<00:02:06.399> we<00:02:06.580> came<00:02:06.759> with

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
own products and therefore we came with

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.809 
own products and therefore we came with
this<00:02:07.119> theme<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.600> tough<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:09.280> tough<00:02:09.580> we<00:02:09.789> are

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
this whole design has come about and the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.330 
this whole design has come about and the

kind of market research that we have

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.800 
kind of market research that we have
done<00:02:24.430> with<00:02:24.760> actual<00:02:25.150> vehicle<00:02:25.569> with<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
done with actual vehicle with the
