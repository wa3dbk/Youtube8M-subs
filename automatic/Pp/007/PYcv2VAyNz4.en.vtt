 what specific results 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.840
 will tell Larissa Zadorozhnaya on now in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 Moscow is clearly a Ukrainian-Russian meeting 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
 only the press was not going to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
 accredited almost all leading 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 world media so intently now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.990
 riveted attention to every political 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 step 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.700
 Ukraine immediately upon arrival in Moscow and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 Yanukovych and Putin Kremlin negotiate 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.399
 Tet-A-Tet 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 this is the eighth meeting of the presidents in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 this year almost three hours of communication 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.969
 when heads of state appear before 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.890
 journalists Putin preempts the question 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 which is in the air for more than one week 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.750
 I want to calm everyone down 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.270
 today we didnâ€™t discuss at all 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.340
 Ukraine joining the customs 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.590
 Union on January 1, Ukraine, Russia will be 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.050

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 oil and gas industry and applause 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 make changes to gas contract 2009 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.540
 years that will be coming 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.540
 6 years 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 it seems that the details were coordinated before 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.900
 last point on the modified 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 contract, the president of Russia reads out with 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.370
 handwritten sheet 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.760
 they are prepared in advance by the apparatus 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.880
 I understand certain difficulties that 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.670
 add up today is not on 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.570
 Ukrainian market bearing in mind that this is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700
 is largely 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.400
 the consequence 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 world economic crisis how are you 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 have seen Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukraine 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.410
 signed supplement which gives 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.790
 opportunity 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.300
 Gazprom that he does not intend to do 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.509
 sell gas to Ukraine for the price of 268 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.270
 half dollars per thousand cubes 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:58.290
 now it's about $ 400 I'm 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.710
 I will speak as it is, I know that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.619
 it would have been a job like that 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.690
 optimal speed if not 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.080
 political will of the president of russia 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.600
 Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich and and about this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.580
 spoke in a wide format and want now 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.250
 say I will not say that we have negotiations 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.290
 were simple and further one more important 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.140
 statement of the Russian government will invest in 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.590
 Ukrainian securities 15 billion 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.450
 dollars 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 Moscow will take them from their own 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.700
 reserves are not about interest not about terms 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.239
 not a tranche of them until they say of course 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.610
 it is time to take energetic 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.820
 there to 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.690
 not only return to level 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.940
 previous years but also create conditions 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.130
 for moving forward I cannot touch 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.710
 questions of our traditional Azov 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:02.820
 I hope that the program is something that 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:06.810
 suggested once about Ukraine and oil 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.920
 their parties also see their 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.870
 opportunities 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.040
 says essentially it's a loan to Kiev for 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.450
 budget support as for 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 reduce gas prices 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.390
 it's all about the new formula contracts wild 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.230

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.360

 a total of 14 signed documents by Ukraine
