but also need a a new running back guys
because<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.170> Steven<00:01:40.530> Jackson

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
because I know they have Steven Jackson

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.460 
because I know they have Steven Jackson
but<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:41.909> he's<00:01:42.119> kinda<00:01:42.509> older<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> history

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
but you know he's kinda older a history

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.569 
but you know he's kinda older a history
two<00:01:43.820> years<00:01:44.820> old<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> game<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.340> maybe<00:01:47.340> he

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
two years old for the game and maybe he

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
two years old for the game and maybe he
needed<00:01:47.970> chillin<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> faster<00:01:49.110> running<00:01:49.320> back

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
needed chillin to a faster running back

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
needed chillin to a faster running back
so<00:01:49.770> hopefully<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.729> know<00:01:50.880> absolutely<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so hopefully you know absolutely just a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.760 
so hopefully you know absolutely just a
running<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> second<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.680> third

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
running back in the second and third

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
running back in the second and third
round<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.119> find<00:01:54.299> running

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
round you know you can find running

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
round you know you can find running
backs<00:01:54.780> anywhere<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.520> mostly<00:01:56.880> uh

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
backs anywhere but I think mostly uh

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
backs anywhere but I think mostly uh
everybody<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> another<00:01:58.500> mock<00:01:58.799> draft<00:01:59.130> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
everybody in another mock draft is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.380 
everybody in another mock draft is
saying<00:01:59.549> they're<00:01:59.729> gonna<00:01:59.850> go<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
saying they're gonna go off in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
saying they're gonna go off in
settlement<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.530> Tyson<00:02:01.740> cab<00:02:02.189> was

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
settlement and I think Tyson cab was

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
settlement and I think Tyson cab was
gonna<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.850> his<00:02:02.969> last<00:02:03.210> year<00:02:03.600> there<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
gonna be his last year there when it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.410 
gonna be his last year there when it
