00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
place better placement is on one of the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.500 
place better placement is on one of the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
branches like on the Apple earpods it's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.360 
branches like on the Apple earpods it's
not<00:01:11.600> really<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.930> huge<00:01:12.260> deal<00:01:12.500> though<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:13.250> going
