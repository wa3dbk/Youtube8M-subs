and different diamond-like feats of

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.610 
and different diamond-like feats of
engineering<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.750> weren't<00:01:14.050> seen<00:01:14.260> on<00:01:14.440> bikes

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
engineering that weren't seen on bikes

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.950 
engineering that weren't seen on bikes
before<00:01:15.040> like<00:01:15.280> GT<00:01:16.210> 750<00:01:17.070> cb750<00:01:18.070> said<00:01:18.790> once<00:01:19.060> all

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
before like GT 750 cb750 said once all

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.730 
before like GT 750 cb750 said once all
the<00:01:20.200> bikes<00:01:20.410> are<00:01:20.620> mere<00:01:20.770> damn<00:01:20.890> Alestorm<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.750> with

the bikes are mere damn Alestorm so with

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.160 
the bikes are mere damn Alestorm so with
that<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.070> mind<00:01:24.100> what<00:01:24.970> would<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.330> think<00:01:25.390> would

the Aprilia rs250 and rs.15 which and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.560 
the Aprilia rs250 and rs.15 which and
see<00:03:03.830> being<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.190> real<00:03:04.430> classic<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.209> future

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
see being a real classic in the future

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.009 
see being a real classic in the future
but<00:03:06.500> for<00:03:06.830> strokes<00:03:07.700> they're<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> bit<00:03:08.360> more<00:03:08.570> they

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
but for strokes they're a bit more they

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.410 
but for strokes they're a bit more they
can<00:03:09.530> see<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:11.470> TL<00:03:12.470> Suzuki<00:03:13.310> TL

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
can see the TL Suzuki TL

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.740 
can see the TL Suzuki TL
so<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.380> uki<00:03:15.680> TL<00:03:16.040> 1000<00:03:16.880> being<00:03:17.090> one<00:03:17.390> because

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
so this is uki TL 1000 being one because

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.110 
so this is uki TL 1000 being one because
they're<00:03:18.080> getting<00:03:18.260> real<00:03:18.590> now<00:03:18.950> I've<00:03:19.700> heard<00:03:19.970> the

again and see that baby one classic goes
in<00:03:32.950> it's<00:03:33.250> not<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.760> technological<00:03:34.540> feat

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
in it's not really technological feat

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020 
in it's not really technological feat
just<00:03:35.019> has<00:03:35.170> been<00:03:35.349> different<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.549> don't<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:36.849> why

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
just has been different I don't know why

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.930 
just has been different I don't know why
I<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.840> me<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.170> different<00:03:38.409> to<00:03:38.590> all<00:03:38.739> these

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
I just to me it's different to all these

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.259 
I just to me it's different to all these
well<00:03:39.940> different<00:03:40.810> what<00:03:41.019> Suzuki<00:03:41.500> normally<00:03:41.920> did

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
well different what Suzuki normally did

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.080 
well different what Suzuki normally did
as<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.510> very<00:03:44.230> very<00:03:44.470> four-cylinder<00:03:45.370> fowls<00:03:45.640> but

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
as in very very four-cylinder fowls but

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.009 
as in very very four-cylinder fowls but
yeah<00:03:47.970> except<00:03:48.970> other<00:03:49.060> than<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.510> I'm<00:03:49.810> trying

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
yeah except other than that I'm trying

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:50.369 
yeah except other than that I'm trying
to<00:03:50.079> think

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
to think

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.170 
to think
ah<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.220> BMW<00:03:51.579> RR<00:03:52.510> 1000<00:03:53.500> know<00:03:53.769> that<00:03:54.489> that's<00:03:54.879> what

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
ah the BMW RR 1000 know that that's what

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.240 
ah the BMW RR 1000 know that that's what
I<00:03:55.209> can<00:03:55.450> see<00:03:55.660> being<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:56.019> real<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:56.560> because<00:03:56.739> well

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
I can see being a real one because well

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.110 
I can see being a real one because well
it's<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:57.940> expensive<00:03:58.920> but<00:03:59.920> also<00:04:00.129> it's<00:04:00.549> not<00:04:01.000> as

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
it's it's expensive but also it's not as

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.880 
it's it's expensive but also it's not as
common<00:04:01.359> as<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.660> lot<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.900> other<00:04:02.019> super<00:04:02.410> bikes<00:04:02.620> out

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
common as a lot of other super bikes out

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.300 
common as a lot of other super bikes out
there<00:04:03.129> not<00:04:03.459> by<00:04:04.000> far<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.859> I<00:04:05.920> think<00:04:06.129> that

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
there not by far and I think that

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.649 
there not by far and I think that
clusters<00:04:06.730> super<00:04:07.060> bikes<00:04:07.239> wouldn't<00:04:07.569> be<00:04:07.629> a

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
clusters super bikes wouldn't be a

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.160 
clusters super bikes wouldn't be a
classic<00:04:08.019> as<00:04:08.140> well<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.069> Juke<00:04:09.250> at<00:04:09.430> ease

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
classic as well so the Juke at ease

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.380 
classic as well so the Juke at ease
patti-anne<00:04:11.519> 1198<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.730> stuff<00:04:12.940> like<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.269> are

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
patti-anne 1198 and stuff like that are

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.190 
patti-anne 1198 and stuff like that are
gonna<00:04:13.510> be<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.870> same

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.140 

and<00:04:16.770> then<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.010> go<00:04:17.130> back<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.730> ones<00:04:17.940> are

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and then you go back to the ones are

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.320 
and then you go back to the ones are
cheap<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.780> people<00:04:19.020> saw<00:04:19.350> where<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.830> gun<00:04:19.950> it

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
cheap and people saw where the gun it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.600 
cheap and people saw where the gun it
it's<00:04:21.330> such<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.750> hard<00:04:21.960> topic<00:04:22.350> once<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.400> think

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
it's such a hard topic once you think

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.280 
it's such a hard topic once you think
