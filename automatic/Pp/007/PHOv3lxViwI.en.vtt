00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.740
 Did you become a reliquary Ira' look Toka or read read the Well 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.030
 Well, is it okay to sell this honestly? 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.110
 It was not rice, I am also the same I never read it until the audition came 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.170
 So please rest assured 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.600
 I'm not alone 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.140
 If you are synchro look I'd had been said to be a little while ago N Toka content of what one really Koka City 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 The feeling with the Kageyama of the ending 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.440
 What do if you are a great match with fart and there a is Wapekore Kageyamaa 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.190
 Poi think Na want to ask chocolate will tune of you or something I do a do something I feel phlegm 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.520
 It is by flame or an image I 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.310
 Of the song 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 Even if only this example is said, it will be this 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.420
 The distribution itself 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.289
 What a volleyball story I think 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.300
 The important things in normal life are amazing 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.180
 So 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.030
 North 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:16.280
 Yokogawa as the original minister's lesson after the mansion of physical education never done Toka array ball 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.860
 I'm doing club activities just now , but it's not age but something 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.190
 It is said that there is something that sounds 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 Maybe I think that the important thing in the life is not a very stuffed work 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.840
 Something like that is not limited to this song 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.759
 Because I put it in the song 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.159
 In particular, this song is I thought I Na or that sort of has come out very heavily 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.159
 Really because birth is in relation to Leo 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.430
 I'm surprised that I feel fit for myself 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:57.880
 It lights of I the headlights but I when I saw so is it the lyrics card really 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:03.829
 Once born even if there is in addition to such incense began to run only rely on me you rack 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:07.650
 Ne entered NiÃ±o but I think that Bawakaru appreciate the bottom of the place that Well bought everyone's 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:14.420
 The bottom of the place or very Hia'okita 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:17.870
 And now it decreased waste Bridge where from I I was really glad of rust 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.590
 I think it's amazing and the lights of the headlights just start to run 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.970
 Kageyama really depends on the tideland 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.310
 Another great and newspaper place to say is I started taking a new step in volleyball 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.310
