00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
what I'm getting at is you still need to

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:45.439 
what I'm getting at is you still need to
get<00:06:44.129> through<00:06:44.370> this<00:06:44.520> in<00:06:44.759> order<00:06:44.909> to<00:06:45.029> get<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.210> this

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449
