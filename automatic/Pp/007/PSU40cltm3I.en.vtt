pleased with these n/a only cost me two

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.470 
pleased with these n/a only cost me two
pounds<00:03:43.890> each<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.250> think<00:03:44.430> these<00:03:44.760> sets<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.880 
pounds each so I think these sets you
really<00:03:45.720> good<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.140> I'm<00:03:46.350> going<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.800> to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
really good and I'm going to have to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.370 
really good and I'm going to have to
rate<00:03:47.100> them<00:03:47.250> high<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:48.270> even<00:03:48.690> though<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.200> world

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
rate them high so even though the world

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.199 
rate them high so even though the world
because<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.860> my<00:03:49.980> slight<00:03:50.400> favor<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.880> still

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
because that is my slight favor I still

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.020
