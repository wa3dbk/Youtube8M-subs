00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.359
 will blow in the house 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.240
 I have no idea 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.300
 my nerves are good 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.650
 he was good 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.890
 aspiration escape character 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.119
 big plus that your role is a member 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.529
 national 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.159
 national amateur team of tajikistan 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.480
 World Championship participant 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 team 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov on 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.400
 final sparring started 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.830
 ants 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.350
 this is preparation 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.940
 in the battle of brands 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.620
 title defense 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 about Europe 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 true 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.910
 replay mom law enforcement officers 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.820
 such evenings provocation technique and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.560
 tactics in general foods 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.190
 The question now is just not enough 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 Petrov great two month work 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 f 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.450
 she tells me that this is atambaev 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450
 I do not agree, I think that 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.280
 even more at odds with the fights 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 his talent is that he can work 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.890
 and specifically not only go ahead and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.000
 powerless i think he is also 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 carry tripoten just this fight can 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560
 show him to feel like him 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 will be the hospital itself 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 at our work personally 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.310
 but title defense in order 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 pawa companies all have two 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.300
 titles 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.500
 rival Alexey Levchenko 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.870
 in Chelyabinsk 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.260
 in most schools 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.940
 good childhood experience 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.740
 but he spent 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.540
 title defense 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.500
 became the champion of Russia among professionals 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.900
 boxing in this weight class 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.170
 that is, others 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020
 at first he is also not a gift 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.820
 future must be specified 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 what is the problem 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.520
 can be expected of him 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.169
 I think what is it 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.769
 and predictability all the same there is to take it 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.019
 the last battle 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.359
 part of the money they made 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.009
 highway 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.009
 punch right to meet 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.039
 he looks like numbers plus minus the same 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.269
 in town 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.909
 suppressing 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.879
 on treatment 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.409
 I think I was invited as a 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.829
 partner sparring 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.150
 two of the most successful starts and we 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.949
 just 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.809
 more less like alexey 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.269
 but also one row 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.480
 I'm just a little bit for speed 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.489
 easier 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.620
 were here a week 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.999
 I really like it like fees 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.209
 quotes from bedroom partners new 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.209
 bureau experience from here is he very experienced 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.179
 hunk 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.749
 just one hundred percent 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.779
 listened cannot percent 70 5 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.960
 readiness i think better fit 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.630
 besides that her whole frequent will go to 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.390
 the election of heads of mid will let the whole team down 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.309
 I think 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:14.959
 there was every chance of being 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.849
 failure 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.519
 and in the usa 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.509
 Yes 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.129
 seizures dv 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.959
 old has passed 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.089
 two weeks have passed 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.779
 I think that 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.509
 time 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.629
 it is well worth spending 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.029
 he has a lot of potential 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.039
 it all depends on him
