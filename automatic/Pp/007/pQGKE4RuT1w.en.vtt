00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.029
 the rolls come out as an apology 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.029
 the song does not start like this 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510
 m 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 green 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.930
 for me 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.930
 even though 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.559
 let's start here with extension 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.810
 starts with the redundancy says 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.760
 more or less so 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.330
 efe 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.330
 okay 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.659
 and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.480
 ok that he jumps about 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.220
 people 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.220
 but we will connect 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.050
 What is it 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.050
 and the second part 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.500
 which starts the third 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.080
 what 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.650
 once again 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.700
 and here begins the fourth part 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.829
 and for inside is this is the same as 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.829
 if they gave him out here 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610
 when 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.370
 in the agreement 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510
 not for out 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.930
 not for sport 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.120
 it's like modernity I want it 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.299

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.930
 and the last person 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.930
 today 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.780
 i 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.859
 after 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.859
 and you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.440
 I'll explain it quickly, because 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.990
 If this is not going to be very long this video 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.180
 but good first we're going to be all the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.350
 melody a little bit faster and the side 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.350
 oriental financial explained 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.819
 d 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.969
 t 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.810
 so I want to hear how I do the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.810
 thief this is here simple 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.680
 i 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.680
 m 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.990
 and it would be that going down the scale 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.750
 i 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.180
 good 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.169
 and 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:52.960
 from 2 to only would be but yes no 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.259
 plus 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.129
 and here I put something simple 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.050
 when the song is turned on 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.009
 it can be a sun setting 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.009
 I do not lack 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.210
 how do you want to make the arrangements 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.560
 may be in delivering well but as 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.900
 I told them we extended the video 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.870
 making this arrangement we do not have it that 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.060
 have liked and any doubt 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.460
 they repeat the video and only one that can not 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.560
 be upstairs and we continue 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.360
 listening to your suggestions as I say 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.550
 again greetings to gerardo pÃ©rez not 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.990
 listen from chicago illinois and for 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.300
 all who put us your suggestions 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.460
 and we read them if we try to get the 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.560
 songs no more to do is a little 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.910
 slower not but you did not like it 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.910
