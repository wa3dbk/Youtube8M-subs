00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello friends and welcome to this new tutorial of mothers as 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.639
 I'm another 97 already premiered here an engine and back 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.889
 come this tutorial they taught me how to do correctly walk more month 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.019
 since not everyone knows 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.609
 we have found we find here in any animation 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 where we can meet 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.620
 wind in scenarios of a young mines that we find with that character 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 have to walk up 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.790
 the walking technique would be to make the character from there writing 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.330
 tiny little boats 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.450
 when walking 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.910
 from left 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.060
 will rise and fall progressively while they are giving 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.070
 and so I would have taken about two steps 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.770
 we look and we do well 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.770
 and so on more or less the same as it has measured well 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.460
 and the summer head 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.250
 as following the boats but 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 Maybe fall should be down. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.780
 and so we will remain for the purpose 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.780
 so funny that you have the data 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 and so we have half a good 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.760
 and the hands should 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.610
 like driving the body so that the impression that it has life 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.030
 vÃ©lez 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.160
 and so we would have made him walk the text that separates him from 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.550
 to the character 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 we check that we look good 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.560
 the movement is a little exaggerated but 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 better pay hours on pictures I've seen myself out there is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 now we possess with the feet that are the trauma of many people 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.680
 but that also does not go beyond 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.700
 give him human 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 well we make them walk 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.400
 the trick is to do what 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.850
 in making the feet move a little more space than the body because if not 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.579
 we will have one year time passed 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.579
 it seems that those who moves at light speed while the body 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.419
 they do not walk 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.519
 of the feet should be more or less coordinated 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.519
 i the foot should pass over the other 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.479
 and the other one below 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.159
 in this way 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
 They should be a little inclined because quilmes with jorquera 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.379
 although good if you want to do another way 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 but it does not look very good 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 we finish after the movement with the feet 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
 and he should have already given our 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:52.089
 basso 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.739
 and so more or less should 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.019
 they were now animation 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 we see the final result 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.619
 that has improved 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.369
 by plundered medium well 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 you can already comment below in the video 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879
 and if we lose the final result you would 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:28.339
 it's not bad I leave it here so you see it a few times 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.009
 and stop this rate of good 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 well subscribe subscribe 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.769
 ii but those who write without it is elusive put down there knew knew 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:39.779
 something like that 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.829
 good that's true until next April 3
