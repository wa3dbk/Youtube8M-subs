the<00:01:31.799> first<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.250> we'll<00:01:32.369> talk<00:01:32.549> about<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.000> this

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the first one we'll talk about is this

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.770 
the first one we'll talk about is this
plastic<00:01:33.689> mityvac<00:01:34.439> unit<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.689> like

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
plastic mityvac unit I really don't like

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
plastic mityvac unit I really don't like
to<00:01:36.900> use<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.259> oil<00:01:37.500> changes<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to use this on oil changes because of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.450 
to use this on oil changes because of
its<00:01:38.490> makeup<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:40.049> mostly<00:01:40.409> plastic<00:01:40.710> internals

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
its makeup it's mostly plastic internals

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060 
its makeup it's mostly plastic internals
it's<00:01:41.700> pretty<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:43.380> evacuating

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it's pretty good for like evacuating

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's pretty good for like evacuating
brake<00:01:44.280> fluid<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.939> power<00:01:45.180> steering<00:01:45.600> fluid<00:01:45.750> but

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
brake fluid and power steering fluid but

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.740 
brake fluid and power steering fluid but
not<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.950> hot<00:01:47.220> engine<00:01:47.399> oil

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
not so good with hot engine oil

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990 
not so good with hot engine oil
sometimes<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.110> plastic<00:01:49.560> inside<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.460> check

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
sometimes the plastic inside the check

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.380 
sometimes the plastic inside the check
valve<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.780> tends<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> melt<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
valve down here tends to melt and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
valve down here tends to melt and
doesn't<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.509> hold<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.530> metal<00:01:55.860> unit

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
doesn't really hold up this metal unit

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
doesn't really hold up this metal unit
on<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.490> hand<00:01:56.729> does<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.090> better<00:01:57.329> with

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
on the other hand does a lot better with

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
on the other hand does a lot better with
hot<00:01:57.840> oil<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.469> pretty<00:01:58.740> much<00:01:58.860> designed<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
hot oil it's pretty much designed for it

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.690 
hot oil it's pretty much designed for it
um<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.930> comes<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.920> buy<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> kit<00:02:02.399> an

the oil pan what happens is now you're
starting<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.530> kink<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.859> hose<00:04:07.009> and<00:04:07.250> bend<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.549> up

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
starting to kink the hose and bend it up

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.399 
starting to kink the hose and bend it up
so<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.599> don't<00:04:08.750> want<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.930> do<00:04:09.019> that<00:04:09.229> because<00:04:09.319> now

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
so you don't want to do that because now

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.110 
so you don't want to do that because now
instead<00:04:09.829> of<00:04:09.979> the<00:04:10.250> holes<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.579> being<00:04:10.879> down

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
instead of the holes just being down

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.629 
instead of the holes just being down
sucking<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.959> oil<00:04:12.139> now<00:04:12.739> starting<00:04:13.159> to<00:04:13.220> kink<00:04:13.489> its

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
sucking the oil now starting to kink its

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.080 
sucking the oil now starting to kink its
