00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
allows us to go ahead and filter that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
allows us to go ahead and filter that
water<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:39.780> cartridge<00:00:40.170> filters<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:41.010> does

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
water through cartridge filters now does

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
water through cartridge filters now does
this<00:00:41.430> basically<00:00:42.000> replace<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.899> pond<00:00:43.260> or<00:00:43.530> pool

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
this basically replace that pond or pool

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.920 
this basically replace that pond or pool
pump<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.250> does<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.399> augment<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.090> i<00:00:45.210> mean<00:00:45.390> what's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
pump or does it augment it i mean what's

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.600 
pump or does it augment it i mean what's
the<00:00:46.020> real<00:00:46.260> deal<00:00:46.289> well<00:00:46.829> each<00:00:47.010> body<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.430> water

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the real deal well each body of water

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.569 
the real deal well each body of water
has<00:00:48.420> its<00:00:48.600> own<00:00:48.719> environment<00:00:49.320> how<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.739> sits<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
has its own environment how it sits and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
has its own environment how it sits and
settles<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.780> its<00:00:51.960> environment<00:00:52.079> fires

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
settles with its environment fires

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.790 
settles with its environment fires
debris<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> breaking<00:00:53.879> down<00:00:54.350> but<00:00:55.350> we

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
debris going in and breaking down but we

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.639 
debris going in and breaking down but we
definitely<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> ability<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.649> eliminate

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
definitely have the ability to eliminate

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
definitely have the ability to eliminate
that<00:00:59.190> pump<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.640> filter<00:00:59.730> system<00:01:00.239> absolutely

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750

installation<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.890> how<00:01:20.159> difficult<00:01:20.700> throw<00:01:20.880> in

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
installation is how difficult throw in

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
installation is how difficult throw in
the<00:01:21.090> pool<00:01:21.240> yeah<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.990> opens<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> box

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the pool yeah one just opens up the box

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
the pool yeah one just opens up the box
once<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> shipped<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> their<00:01:24.270> house

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
once they get it shipped to their house

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
once they get it shipped to their house
and<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.320> pull<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.740> pool<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and they just pull it in the pool and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.969 
and they just pull it in the pool and
anyway<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.320> accessories

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
anyway they go we do have accessories

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880 
anyway they go we do have accessories
for<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.720> which<00:01:30.720> allows<00:01:31.049> people<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.590> lights

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
for it which allows people to do lights

kit alarms child alarms gate alarms and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100 
kit alarms child alarms gate alarms and
we<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:35.909> test<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> water<00:01:36.689> far<00:01:37.049> as

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
we can also test the water far as

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.700 
we can also test the water far as
chemistry<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.630> sestri<00:01:39.990> pack<00:01:40.200> around<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
chemistry so the sestri pack around it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.480 
chemistry so the sestri pack around it
is<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.040> extremely<00:01:41.430> powerful<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
is just extremely powerful and and you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
is just extremely powerful and and you
know<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.270> might<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
know as you might know or not know the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800 
know as you might know or not know the
second<00:01:47.399> leading<00:01:47.520> cause<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> 14<00:01:48.689> year

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
second leading cause to one of 14 year

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
second leading cause to one of 14 year
old<00:01:48.930> death<00:01:49.110> rates<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.560> drowning<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> people

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
old death rates is drowning in people

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.249 
old death rates is drowning in people
swimming<00:01:50.579> pools<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:51.990> also

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
swimming pools so we think we can also

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
swimming pools so we think we can also
eliminate<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.280> well<00:01:53.460> long<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.820> they<00:01:54.000> had

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
eliminate that as well long as they had

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
eliminate that as well long as they had
our<00:01:54.270> appliance<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> appliances<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
our appliance so the appliances in the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
our appliance so the appliances in the
polls<00:01:56.430> filtering<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> water<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> can

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
polls filtering the water but it can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
polls filtering the water but it can
also<00:01:58.110> tell<00:01:58.799> me<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.670> child<00:01:59.880> has<00:02:00.210> fallen<00:02:00.479> in

also tell me that my child has fallen in

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.090

12<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.860> 14<00:02:35.010> hours<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> day<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.150> sounds<00:02:36.450> like

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
12 or 14 hours a day and it sounds like

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.720 
12 or 14 hours a day and it sounds like
a<00:02:36.570> car<00:02:36.900> idling<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.500> add<00:02:37.650> library<00:02:37.860> this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
a car idling and add library this

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.180 
a car idling and add library this
basically<00:02:39.120> eliminates<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.050> entirely<00:02:40.710> but

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
basically eliminates that entirely but

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370 
basically eliminates that entirely but
not<00:02:41.340> only<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.760> his<00:02:42.330> electrical<00:02:42.900> costs<00:02:43.140> must

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
not only that his electrical costs must

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.530 
not only that his electrical costs must
be<00:02:43.530> enormous<00:02:43.770> oh<00:02:44.130> well<00:02:44.460> each<00:02:44.760> pulse<00:02:45.030> each<00:02:45.300> pool

might<00:03:16.020> be<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.260> case<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.890> certain<00:03:17.160> scenarios

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
might be the case in certain scenarios

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.300 
might be the case in certain scenarios
but<00:03:18.120> one<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.810> also<00:03:19.019> buy<00:03:19.410> our<00:03:19.620> bigger<00:03:19.830> version

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
but one can also buy our bigger version

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.630 
but one can also buy our bigger version
this<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.610> our<00:03:20.730> 55<00:03:21.239> watt<00:03:21.590> 10,000<00:03:22.590> gallon<00:03:22.890> unit

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
this is our 55 watt 10,000 gallon unit

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.030 
this is our 55 watt 10,000 gallon unit
we<00:03:24.209> go<00:03:24.360> all<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> way<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> 40,000<00:03:25.739> gallons

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
we go all the way up to 40,000 gallons

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.650 
we go all the way up to 40,000 gallons
which<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.760> bigger<00:03:27.000> panel<00:03:27.450> bigger

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
which is just a bigger panel bigger

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.020 
which is just a bigger panel bigger

float that floats on top of the water
and<00:03:30.120> does<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.510> also<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.959> called

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
and does it but we also have called

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
and does it but we also have called
bottom<00:03:31.769> feeders<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.850> they<00:03:32.970> simply<00:03:33.150> sit<00:03:33.570> down

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
or just let it spin around the pool and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.080 
or just let it spin around the pool and
you<00:04:07.799> can<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.190> absolutely<00:04:08.820> there's

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
you can do that absolutely there's

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.720 
you can do that absolutely there's
definitely<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.780> no<00:04:10.380> danger<00:04:10.799> on<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:10.950> angles<00:04:11.519> but

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
definitely a no danger on the angles but

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.949 
definitely a no danger on the angles but
to<00:04:11.910> pull<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.180> out<00:04:12.239> it's<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:12.540> pulling<00:04:12.690> out<00:04:12.930> a

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
to pull it out it's like pulling out a

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.979 
to pull it out it's like pulling out a
raft<00:04:13.620> or<00:04:13.970> or<00:04:14.970> something<00:04:15.209> like<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.360> makes<00:04:15.810> no

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
raft or or something like that makes no

raft or or something like that makes no
noise<00:04:16.760> well<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:18.239> makes<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.600> little<00:04:18.900> bit<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.260> a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
noise well it makes a little bit of a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.690 
noise well it makes a little bit of a
home<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:19.830> you'd<00:04:19.979> really<00:04:20.280> have<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.430> put<00:04:20.580> your

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
home but you'd really have to put your

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.130 
home but you'd really have to put your
ear<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.180> but<00:04:21.330> nothing<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.780> what<00:04:21.959> we're

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
ear to it but nothing like what we're
