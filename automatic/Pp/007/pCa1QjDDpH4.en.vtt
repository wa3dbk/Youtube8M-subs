00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
touch about the scuppers back so if I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.590 
touch about the scuppers back so if I
would<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> Scotland<00:01:30.270> came<00:01:30.360> again

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
would use the Scotland came again

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.649 
would use the Scotland came again
because<00:01:30.930> they're<00:01:31.680> used<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> being<00:01:32.820> coached

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
because they're used to being coached

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
because they're used to being coached
and<00:01:33.960> they'll<00:01:34.770> never<00:01:34.799> coach<00:01:35.159> anybody<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and they'll never coach anybody so I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
and they'll never coach anybody so I
think<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> only<00:01:36.540> place<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> will

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
think this is the only place that will

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
think this is the only place that will
