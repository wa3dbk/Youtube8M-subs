these<00:02:12.210> PVC<00:02:12.720> pipes<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.350> simply<00:02:13.680> chosen<00:02:13.950> PVC

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
these PVC pipes I have simply chosen PVC

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.490 
these PVC pipes I have simply chosen PVC
pipes<00:02:14.790> because<00:02:15.210> they<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:15.480> inexpensive<00:02:15.810> easy

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
pipes because they are inexpensive easy

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.830 
pipes because they are inexpensive easy
to<00:02:17.430> get<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> hold<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.970> they're<00:02:18.240> strong

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
to get a hold of they're strong

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.620 
to get a hold of they're strong
and<00:02:18.990> they<00:02:19.200> do<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.709> biodegrade<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:21.209> they<00:02:21.450> will

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and they do not biodegrade so they will

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.580 
and they do not biodegrade so they will
last<00:02:21.780> as<00:02:22.050> long<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.530> bin<00:02:22.709> does<00:02:23.750> okay<00:02:24.780> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
last as long as the bin does okay this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.309 
last as long as the bin does okay this
bottom<00:02:26.010> door<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.390> held<00:02:27.930> shut<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to get some more airflow I'm going to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.110 
to get some more airflow I'm going to
bring<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.860> lamp<00:02:35.069> over<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.940> look

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
bring a lamp over so that we can look

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.080 
bring a lamp over so that we can look
inside<00:02:37.100> this<00:02:38.100> bin<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
bottom of the bin is very simply an

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.530 
bottom of the bin is very simply an
empty<00:02:45.480> space<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.640> where<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.850> harvest<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
empty space this is where I harvest the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.600 
empty space this is where I harvest the
castings<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.530> now<00:02:49.709> what<00:02:49.890> I'm<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
castings and now what I'm going to do is

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.030 
castings and now what I'm going to do is
attempt<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.180> show<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.560> bedding<00:02:52.800> and

the worms resting on top of the PVC
pipes<00:02:55.550> um<00:02:56.550> hopefully<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.090> keep<00:02:57.420> enough<00:02:57.690> light

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
in between the PVC pipes and you pull

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.800 
in between the PVC pipes and you pull
out<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.540> castings<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:33.090> will<00:03:33.269> know<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.480> the

smells like Pleasant damp earth you know
that<00:03:49.290> these<00:03:49.440> castings<00:03:50.010> are<00:03:50.190> ready<00:03:50.370> when

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
that these castings are ready when

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.520 
that these castings are ready when
you're<00:03:51.390> harvesting<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:52.019> can<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.350> keep

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you're harvesting you can just keep

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710 
you're harvesting you can just keep
reaching<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.280> between<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.640> PVC<00:03:54.209> pipes<00:03:54.480> to

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
reaching up in between the PVC pipes to

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.780 
reaching up in between the PVC pipes to
pull<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.049> out<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:55.980> soon<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.489> start

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.569 
pull it out and as soon as you start
pulling<00:03:57.090> out<00:03:57.359> worms<00:03:57.780> or<00:03:58.260> cocoons<00:03:59.190> or<00:03:59.489> it

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
pulling out worms or cocoons or it

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.670 
pulling out worms or cocoons or it
doesn't<00:03:59.790> smell<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.299> nice<00:04:00.690> fresh<00:04:01.079> earth<00:04:01.320> just

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
doesn't smell like nice fresh earth just

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.620 
doesn't smell like nice fresh earth just
put<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.010> back<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.459> top<00:04:02.640> you're<00:04:03.180> done<00:04:03.390> for

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
put it back in the top you're done for

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.970 
put it back in the top you're done for
now

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
now

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.310 
now
so<00:04:04.980> with<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.970> flow-through<00:04:06.209> bin<00:04:06.720> everything

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
so with the flow-through bin everything

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.400 
so with the flow-through bin everything
goes<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.799> top<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:09.690> harvesting<00:04:10.260> of

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
goes in the top and the harvesting of

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.810 
goes in the top and the harvesting of
the<00:04:10.500> vermicompost<00:04:10.799> comes<00:04:11.519> out<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.850> bottom<00:04:12.620> in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
the vermicompost comes out the bottom in
