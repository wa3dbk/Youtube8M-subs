based on the incoming freshman the the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.809 
based on the incoming freshman the the
tailbacks<00:02:14.350> coming<00:02:14.650> into<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.860> program<00:02:15.010> how

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
tailbacks coming into the program how

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.550 
tailbacks coming into the program how
quickly<00:02:16.120> they<00:02:16.360> adapt<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.140> pick<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
quickly they adapt and pick up the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.890 
quickly they adapt and pick up the
scheme<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.130> how<00:02:18.220> they<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.400> fit<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.720> he's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
scheme and how they can fit in but he's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.360 
scheme and how they can fit in but he's
a<00:02:19.930> valuable<00:02:20.200> weapon<00:02:20.709> for<00:02:20.920> us<00:02:20.980> much<00:02:21.160> like

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
a valuable weapon for us much like
