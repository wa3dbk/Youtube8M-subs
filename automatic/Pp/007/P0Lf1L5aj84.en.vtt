that video there when I first hopped on
the<00:06:14.159> dirt<00:06:14.399> bike<00:06:14.580> and<00:06:14.729> took<00:06:14.909> off<00:06:15.149> that<00:06:15.449> actually

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:15.869 
the dirt bike and took off that actually

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:18.799 
the dirt bike and took off that actually
was<00:06:16.110> my<00:06:16.319> very<00:06:16.589> first<00:06:16.679> time<00:06:17.360> with<00:06:18.360> that<00:06:18.569> bike

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:18.809 
was my very first time with that bike

was my very first time with that bike
taking<00:06:19.110> off<00:06:19.379> with<00:06:19.589> it

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
taking off with it

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.879 
taking off with it
took<00:06:21.659> me<00:06:21.809> a<00:06:21.869> little<00:06:21.959> bit<00:06:22.169> to<00:06:22.289> get<00:06:22.379> used<00:06:22.619> to<00:06:22.679> the

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
took me a little bit to get used to the

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.829 
took me a little bit to get used to the
clutching<00:06:23.819> the<00:06:23.969> power<00:06:24.179> band<00:06:24.509> of<00:06:24.749> the

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:24.839 
clutching the power band of the

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.759 
clutching the power band of the
two-stroke<00:06:27.019> I'm<00:06:28.019> sure<00:06:28.199> it<00:06:28.289> takes<00:06:28.469> most<00:06:28.619> people

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:28.769 
two-stroke I'm sure it takes most people

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:30.079 
two-stroke I'm sure it takes most people
a<00:06:29.009> little<00:06:29.159> bit<00:06:29.309> of<00:06:29.399> time<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.639> get<00:06:29.729> used<00:06:29.939> to<00:06:29.999> that

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
a little bit of time to get used to that

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.879 
a little bit of time to get used to that
