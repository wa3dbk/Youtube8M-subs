very<00:00:31.040> strange<00:00:31.570> I've<00:00:32.570> been<00:00:32.809> thinking<00:00:33.080> about

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
very strange I've been thinking about

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.650 
very strange I've been thinking about
those<00:00:33.680> carvings<00:00:34.190> we<00:00:34.610> saw<00:00:34.820> before<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.210> Eclipse

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660

the<00:00:46.580> pictures<00:00:46.910> from<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.150> tattoo<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.350> code

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
the pictures from the tattoo it's a code

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.390 
the pictures from the tattoo it's a code
16<00:00:51.370> 134<00:00:53.140> there's<00:00:54.140> nothing<00:00:54.260> too<00:00:54.500> much<00:00:54.650> perhaps

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
16 134 there's nothing too much perhaps

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:06.310 
16 134 there's nothing too much perhaps
the<00:00:55.640> answer<00:00:55.970> lies<00:00:56.000> inside<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.989> step<00:00:57.229> you<00:01:05.320> all

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
the answer lies inside that step you all

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.280 
the answer lies inside that step you all
right<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.560> once<00:01:06.710> I've<00:01:06.860> got<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.040> shop<00:01:07.340> here<00:01:07.369> uh

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
right so once I've got a shop here uh

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.200 
right so once I've got a shop here uh
you<00:01:09.290> hear<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.560> radio<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.310> they<00:01:10.790> give<00:01:11.000> off<00:01:11.030> a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
you hear that radio and they give off a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.210 
you hear that radio and they give off a
code<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.630> 16<00:01:12.939> 134<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.560> what<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:15.680> actually<00:01:15.710> did

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
code of 16 134 and what we actually did

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.990 
code of 16 134 and what we actually did
is<00:01:16.460> we<00:01:16.700> google<00:01:17.119> searched<00:01:17.420> my<00:01:17.869> in<00:01:17.930> numbers<00:01:18.530> and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
is we google searched my in numbers and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.300 
is we google searched my in numbers and
we<00:01:20.000> noticed<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:20.420> they<00:01:20.780> were<00:01:21.250> these<00:01:22.250> little

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
we noticed that they were these little

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.870 
we noticed that they were these little
symbols<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:23.060> here<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.829> one<00:01:24.829> dot<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.759> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
symbols on here and one dot is just the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.480 
symbols on here and one dot is just the
number<00:01:26.000> one<00:01:26.359> and<00:01:26.829> three<00:01:27.829> dot<00:01:27.979> says<00:01:28.280> number

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
number one and three dot says number

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.830 
number one and three dot says number
three<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:30.219> then<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.609> four<00:01:32.179> is<00:01:32.420> going<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.630> be<00:01:32.810> a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
three and then the four is going to be a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.410 
three and then the four is going to be a
C<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.619> then<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.219> 16<00:01:34.729> is<00:01:34.939> actually<00:01:35.240> going<00:01:35.329> to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
C and then the 16 is actually going to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.249 
C and then the 16 is actually going to
be<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.570> sea<00:01:35.899> with<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> line<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.399> dot<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.259> so

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
be a sea with a line and the dot and so

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.289 
be a sea with a line and the dot and so
the<00:01:39.530> order<00:01:39.859> that<00:01:40.249> you<00:01:40.280> want<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.549> do<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.999> the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
the order that you want to do it is the

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.700 
the order that you want to do it is the
one<00:01:41.390> I'm<00:01:41.509> looking<00:01:41.539> at<00:01:41.929> right<00:01:41.960> there<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.560> what

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
one I'm looking at right there that what

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.419 
one I'm looking at right there that what
you<00:01:42.890> want<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.249> one<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.520> be<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> one<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:46.219> see

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
you want that one to be the one you see

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.800 
you want that one to be the one you see
i'll<00:01:46.549> turn<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:46.999> the<00:01:47.030> one<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.420> want<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.659> be

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
one to my left right now as you're

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.910 
one to my left right now as you're
watching<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.450> video<00:02:02.719> the<00:02:02.869> left<00:02:03.079> diagonal<00:02:03.649> you

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
watching the video the left diagonal you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.749 
watching the video the left diagonal you
want<00:02:04.069> that<00:02:04.280> one<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.639> on<00:02:04.729> three<00:02:05.859> and<00:02:06.859> so<00:02:07.549> yeah

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
want that one to be on three and so yeah

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.460 
want that one to be on three and so yeah
I<00:02:07.939> don't<00:02:08.149> know<00:02:08.210> how<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:09.140> just<00:02:09.289> kind<00:02:09.440> of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
I don't know how we we just kind of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.850 
I don't know how we we just kind of
guess<00:02:09.679> if<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.160> mine<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:11.560> guess<00:02:12.560> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
guess if this is mine I guess that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.660 
guess if this is mine I guess that
whatever<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.850> title<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> zombie<00:02:14.780> map<00:02:14.990> is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
whatever the title of the zombie map is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.949 
whatever the title of the zombie map is
someone<00:02:16.670> said<00:02:16.850> it's<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.180> book<00:02:17.750> about

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
someone said it's like a book about

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.690 
someone said it's like a book about
mines<00:02:18.319> or<00:02:18.620> something<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.069> we<00:02:19.100> just<00:02:19.280> decided<00:02:19.370> to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
mines or something so we just decided to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.460 
mines or something so we just decided to
look<00:02:19.790> at<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> mine<00:02:20.240> numbers<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.870> hope<00:02:21.319> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
look at the mine numbers I hope this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.590 
look at the mine numbers I hope this
helped<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.800> guys<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:23.150> reason<00:02:23.390> why<00:02:23.450> we're

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
helped you guys and the reason why we're

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.780 
helped you guys and the reason why we're
working<00:02:23.750> from<00:02:24.260> later<00:02:24.590> levels<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.280> because

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790
