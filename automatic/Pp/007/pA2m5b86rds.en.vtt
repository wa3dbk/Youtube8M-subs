00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.780
 short and finished product videos 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.080
 review on these in relation to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.110
 care and washing and hygiene of 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.200
 hair and scalp 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.070
 then I always have my bag 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.070
 then first of all 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.520
 shampoo 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.380
 we shing of yes to carrots 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.970
 shardana yes to carrots I think of 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.330
 having heard it from lucy for the first 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.910
 time they are phenomenal among other things first 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.340
 they were go and then therefore sephora 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.660
 he took them out of business and then 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.120
 I thought I couldn't find it anymore now 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.640
 I'm his cover this is 99 for 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.180
 one hundred natural so certainly not for 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.150
 a hundred but fabulous now I'm trying 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.140
 meadows institute 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.480
 I think it's shampoo 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.910
 volumizing I haven't finished it yet but 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.229
 these havocs from yes to are phenomenal 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.060
 however carrots will also buy in 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.740
 I liked this shampoo 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.250
 I had already spoken to you about it new sees from 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.460
 millet for normal and good hair 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.390
 the best yes to carrots then anyway 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.000
 I finished the nutritious bio mask 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.950
 of bio water plus good essential oils 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.780
 very good too nutritious for me i 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.810
 my hair does not need it is 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.050
 normal are fine but it would be a nice thing 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.479
 Christmas gift I will not buy again for 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.640
 this because I don't need it but not 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.800
 it was absolutely ok then then this one 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.810
 I have to review for months sorry if it has 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.220
 cut but it was to consume it in its entirety is 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.490
 the green aloe vera gel 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.289
 I cut it had a regulator 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.780
 stupid fact that there is no stopper 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.820
 then turn and say come 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 then the product comes down from the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 same side where you support it e 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.830
 this is not a very hygienic gel 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.009
 very pure aloe as I have it 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.810
 used myself but mostly to spread 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.120
 on the skin together with the oil like 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.770
 carrier for essential oils e 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.170
 very expensive but you know that holy green 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.660
 has its own aloe plantations in 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.580
 spain so don't buy them from others e 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.120
 supervising on their own 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 plantations this is a very good one 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.650
 very good thing but I will not buy it again 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.250
 too expensive 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 yes the quality is paid however and then I have 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.980
 finished a neutral package of 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.060
 centifolia bio centifolia bio a brand 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.769
 French that I like very much use 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.920
 Always No decent products when then 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.069
 this is the zante brilliant balm 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.069
 that 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.050
 it's not bad but the volume easing balm 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.670
 of est car 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.350
 this they know right now but that 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.440
 I'm not done yet if you eat it a 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.440
 Breakfast 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.570
 no better than that gesture 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.310
 infinitely so this was not 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.960
 evil has also done his enough 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.360
 work, however, weighs them down too much 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.630
 instead balm of yes to carrots these 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.170
 they are not freshly polished hair 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.709
 keeps the volume e 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.680
 it's really better under certain points 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:40.110
 of view 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.930
 American products are good 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.220
 this shampoo and I found great jean 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.170
 masters organics ehning primeros shampoo 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.600
 the one for dry hair 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.130
 you know that the champs entirely 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.840
 natural as well as others but 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.000
 especially the entirely natural ones 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.980
 they should be diluted and keep a bottle 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.930
 small in the bathroom you put a finger of 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.080
 completely natural shampoo then water 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.940
 shake and always use the shampoo 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.489
 also the soaps always diluted and 70 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.150
 percent of the ingredients are 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.970
 organic certificates 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.419
 inside this yummy shampoo 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.669
 very good this shampoo if you had it 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.960
 readily available available there 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.090
 buy back this had been part of a 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.770
 gift of a voucher I picked up on loch 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.390
 on the log site lula dot com 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.400
 it is not a site that I frequent a lot 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.120
 because the blue of the brand entirely 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.120
 very natural 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.380
 some are very luxurious products 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.530
 valid others, however, it is difficult 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.090
 being able to afford those brands 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.860
 regularly so I enjoyed using 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.250
 this shampoo 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.380
 however I can not can not continue to 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.830
 then spend a key ingredient 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.200
 for my blond the rhubarb root 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.210
 centifolia reports that if you want 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.730
 try nenÃ¨ blond make yours yours 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.940
 mix put in quantity this is the 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.120
 turmeric and you will have some good looks 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.120
 satisfactions 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.660
 and then finally they closed it in me 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.720
 I tried so many colors k porcari te 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.310
 I have not yet tried the fifth color 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.920
 vegetable then try for us I tried 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.230
 that which was the reflective is now the 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.880
 my dark blond or light brown base 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.420
 so I don't think you see i 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.900
 reflected by this light however some 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.370
 whites that were there were a bit 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.200
 camouflaged by these gold reflections from 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.890
 these blond reflections 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:51.840
 leave the glossy hair is a pap 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.790
 a powder in paprika which is mixed 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.030
 water and then leave on I 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.520
 leave on for two hours and then there is the 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.490
 fixative balm the pap will not come 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.530
 made with a powder is made with 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.920
 a dust like lines but with a tube 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.140
 already done and then there is his tube 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.950
 there are instructions anyway 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.910
 clearly 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.910
 and then there's the balm tube 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.139
 fixative you see something 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.750
 so you put this pap in it 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:26.470
 a small bowl with mi seems 90 ml of 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:30.660
 water seems to me 90 and then tele 28 2 hours 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:34.960
 rinse put the fixative balm 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:37.000
 cute a product definitely from gods 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.030
 beautiful reflections also lasted second 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.850
 me a little bit more than n maybe they have 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:48.010
 started to disappear after a fifth 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:50.050
 sex shampoo and then always to make a 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.560
 mask instead of bassano for i 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.979
 hair 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.430
 I used the name dust 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:59.590
 ayurvedic of the akamuti firm I put it 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.240
 with warm water until it crushes it 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.949
 with a wooden spoon plastic 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.460
 until it becomes a stern and tarascio 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:10.630
 laying on wet and damp hair for 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.430
 the time of some video cures by 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.280
 read me some newspaper in peace 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.889
 in the bathtub and then the rinse 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.830
 and leaves the hair soft and very soft 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:24.520
 there are those who do not tolerate the smell of nejm a 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.520
 I like it and so I used it with 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.970
 satisfaction and that's all for the 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.810
 hair-related products 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.550
 foliage 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:38.200
 I am very happy because apart from i 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.520
 fake blond reflections I had given 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.530
 to the matches 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.300
 for the rest since using products 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.210
 hair completely natural 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.430
 they have awakened with a lucidity 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.960
 unbelievable I don't even have one anymore 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.360
 double point e 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.580
 yes, given my age there will be some 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.889
 problem of whites that I believe 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.139
 not to cover but in short we'll stay at 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:01.630
 see why then sometimes you change 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.910
 opinion of life, however, for the moment 

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.370
 I seem to leave them like this because 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.470
 I'm really good too 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.360
 yes to shampoo too happened 

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:15.310
 carrots are too beautiful hair when 

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:17.979
 then come back natural splendor are 

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.729
 even more manageable and see you at 

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.729
