00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.360
 Hey, everybody, it's okay, just a boss. 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.430
 espinosa watched fought here on tv 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.270
 should present a very 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.950
 cool 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.840
 out in our restaurant that I 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.970
 I'm sure you will too. 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.490
 like very simple made with 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.160
 super-thin ingredients is one thousand sheets 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.619
 of eggplant and zucchini with compote 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.750
 tomato and judges gratin 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.109
 This proposal, I will not do it for you. 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.079
 but it is very easy automatic peeling 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.100
 strip seed leads to a pan 3 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.379
 sugar spoons 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.839
 this recipe for 10 of the barÃ§a 3 spoons 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.649
 of sugar a little salt projection 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.719
 in fresh white wine and let reduce 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.729
 Pope until this pope we will 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.799
 hit the blender and it will stay there 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.139
 This delight here is what we 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.819
 will do with our caption I do not have 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.620
 that show you get super 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:03.149
 that can serve as both a 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.149
 starter as main course 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.970
 Good, then we gave it a light weight test. 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.790
 that in viridiana mourinho that are black 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.980
 they cook very fast but it's good to give 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.010
 A little jolt to not stay so long 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:39.440
 time outside we will put a 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:43.670
 layer that asked for a little of the glass and the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.740
 Good parmesan cheese I prefer to use 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.479
 another vision because at the same time he already 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:02:00.080
 gives a natural escape from our deadline 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:02:05.270
 zucchini tomato compote and a reason 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.500
 we will progress so three 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.920
 power cable 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.260
 even because it's not good to do too loud 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.720
 because our self is he can later 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.739
 it contains too much cheese the time it goes 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.420
 melting turned workforce 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 seemed simple - rated 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:50.780
 ending with another tomato ball 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.780
 that is useful for July 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:06.760
 Oh, that's better off then. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.580
 we have here our thousand flowers gratin 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.090
 about seven minutes in the oven from 200 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.060
 250 degrees the same formula of the championship 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 and we will assemble the dishes including 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.540
 case like leaves as I said 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.000
 previously disant if you have a 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.550
 straws at home rosemary hair to the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.200
 times by then it will avoid that room 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.390
 he falls into shape 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.170
 so we have here our thousand sheets 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.410
 eggplant zucchini 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.410
 b gratin
