00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.480
 we will use the container to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.100
 the dry soul he can grind seeds 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 more effectively than the container 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.730
 regular since it moves the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.680
 ingredients up you can 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 grind flour in a minute 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.730
 we will transform grains of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 whole wheat in a fresh bun and so much 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 healthy you can also grind up 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.359
 rice beans or tapioca in flour 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 for gluten-free recipes 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 the advantage of grinding your own 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.179
 flour the ide in the fact that it does not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.940
 be neither whiten nor denature of their 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.170
 nutritional components 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.480
 you have them now freche is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 filled with nutrients grinding the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.020
 grains to is so fast and so easy you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.760
 can literally take a step home 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.199
 every day that gives you a 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.079
 important source of dietary fiber 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.969
 of vitamins and which tastes better than 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.949
 bread sold in stores we will 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:00.050
 start with our cereal recipe 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:01:02.339
 whole wheat a little salt 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 I'm going to grind the grain into the 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 container dry soul 32 years farm 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 and well the cover I mention you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 that the cover lid of vita mix 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 also serves as a measuring instrument for 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.479
 quantity let's start with level 1 then 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.939
 increase rapidly to level 10 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.710
 then to the high speed setting I 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.860
 will grind the grains of wheat during a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.860
 minute 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.710
 we now have a wheat flour 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.090
 freshly ground whole with which 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 we will make a dough to 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.509
 bread when grinding your grain 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.070
 you do not need to add oil 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.229
 to the recipe since the grains of wheat 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.420
 whole are filled with natural oil 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.890
 another suggestion for getting 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.929
 best results you can place 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.789
 your fat in the freezer when 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.340
 you grind the frozen grain you do not 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.800
 lose no precious enzymes other 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.390
 thing do not grind more than 2 thanks to the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.680
 time for that grain then circuit 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.680
 evenly in the container
