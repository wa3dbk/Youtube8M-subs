00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.440

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.750
 To see if you can get this world out of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.379

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.420
 with hefty you can see that obviously gives 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.550
 to steal the bus but he did not 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.899
 for us to be the driver of the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.399
 Coach guys as we can. 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.890
 be a taxi driver 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.020
 I had not stolen a bus until then 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.420
 You asked me for the bus speech from 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.810
 Bus driver's square looks to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.550
 be driver but gives to give 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.590
 drive the bus 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.569
 ride the bus but do not get the driver 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.259
 Do not drive people in the place until 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:31.450
 another went by taxi in the case by now 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.820
 example behind us in gurizada not 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.380
 I will not even try to make because I do not 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.119
 made the truck 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 automatically we know it does not work 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 To take the bus 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.180
 we were already look I think it rolled 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.689
 saints singing their successes right here 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.990
 I'm going to enjoy it and I'll enjoy it 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.579
 totally the way after winning 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.829
 quite the way I'll win out here 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.299
 from the front face and I go here in the bag says 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.610
 that just to show that you can not 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.369
 to train to show is not to prove 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.969
 because I do not know either 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.039
 do not say no, do not look away 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.140
 You can not take the bus then and not 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.480
 It can not be to do a mission like 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.370
 bus driver is not even required 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.890
 which we could not even do with a 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.910
 Taxi leaves on but all of you 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.769
 so let's take a look 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.940
 in the city so I should not do 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.980
 one of the two things that the video does not 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.600
 to be too short 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.330
 Let's try to get away from the police by bus. 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 So 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.760
 My grandfather weaves an event from me I go 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.020
 show one by one 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.170
 Look, there's a handsome man I do not know. 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.520
 What side of the city I'm going to? 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.940
 getting away from the police bus guyed is 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:52.730
 tense even more two stars made 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.090
 maximum priority of the bus until the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.950
 driving is not so difficult if you notice that 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.840
 all the signs are always closed to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.820
 me always all signs or closed to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.300
 me that is solving the game 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.500
 Let's close the pitt angels. 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.140
 I managed to leave it for a while to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.040
 behind guys, incredible as it may seem 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.540
 a law that was a strong car gives 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.220
 to rob us of a strong car and only 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.220
 is at the back door looks at the police 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.390
 there is no more behind me one stay 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:28.310
 stopped by here let's see if people 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:30.140
 He manages to escape them then one volcano 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 range rover sport the galera said that by 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.209
 being a rover sport is also well 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.090
 well plausible what the guys said 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.980
 makes sense'm very beast in 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.860
 cars or making cars and always 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:49.010
 It has some tips to know more enough 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.510
 I do not think so. 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:57.200
 so that was the stealing bus 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.739
 there has to see that we can not do 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.739
 the mission you can not take the bus 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:07.010
 also give yes to give to hit in 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.320
 the whole world out there maybe people 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.790
 Olympic settings people of pain guys 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.190
 Look, it's not me, it's not me. 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.720
 the aura trick to steal the bus is 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.940
 walking around there will have everyone and 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.610

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.660
 directed the bus as it ends with the sunset 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.510
