00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.009
 I'm here to show you sides of today 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.890
 because I particularly like it in 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.230
 how much are in the colors that I am 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.720
 literally worshiping for this car 1 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.019
 and therefore the colors that go a little now 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 in fashion like new then camel color 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.199
 cashmere that I personally like 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.879
 very much because I find them very close 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.129
 and so I played a little with these 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.410
 colors also with gray then with 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 of neutral colors that are colors 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.730
 not colors that find just what I said 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.710
 first the fat leaves me there 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 he writes I always hope you take 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 these videos the right way why not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.619
 I claim to teach in Italy 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.450
 just so I don't want to tell everyone that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.460
 they have to dress like I am here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.119
 simply so I don't know so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.369
 this beige suit precisely 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.039
 this dress and hygiene 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.800
 so it's very nice very comfortable 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.780
 on him because he is so knit 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.170
 so very soft at three sleeves 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.600
 quarters if you notice the neck then like this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 I find it in the neckline then for 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.349
 so now it's very simple 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.780
 then she was instead under the dress because 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:36.209
 obviously now I think I 'm wearing it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.200
 these covering colans are enough 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:42.840
 thick that I bought from benetton e 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.789
 they are of this gray color also they are 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 gray a little bit of detail inside 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.890
 in my opinion also a bit of green and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.259
 so it seemed to me that it was a color 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.039
 which goes well with neutral color 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.830
 beige then of the dress and therefore I don't know 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.590
 these four these colani at the feet 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.270
 instead I wear these boots that he has 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.369
 purchased just recently and that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 I really love pad i 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 pistols just putting it often since 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.900
 he bought them are brown prizes not 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.959
 I know if a brand you know is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.750
 unfortunately this is enough septa 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.460
 because I paid them 145 euros but there 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.830
 I adore 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.630
 they are very soft they are too much 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.280
 nice in my opinion also the heel then not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.920
 it is very high and therefore also comfortable 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.240
 there is this hinge then that ends here 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 so 1 lap raise if you want to try more 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.180
 studies so name I like for 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.760
 contain it lowered and these are 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.440
 then type suede outside if you notice 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.930
 and they are of this gray color and therefore 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.840
 according to me it is fine then with the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.180
 Color also of stockings over invested 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.490
 because obviously cold off this 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.980
 coat I bought a few days 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.860
 acts as a zara and is this color coat 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.990
 camel which I think is really a lot 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.890
 so they were nice enough 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.750
 long then gets below on his knees 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.550
 but let's change the buttons because they don't 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.920
 I liked them for the original ones 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.790
 that he had a coat was words 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.860
 school 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.870
 according to me they didn't get that much 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.320
 given that it is very simple 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.570
 behind an ostentatious spark we pass 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.730
 then the accessories and I brought 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.970
 behind you this hat you have 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.650
 already seen in the video the previous one 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.450
 bought in my area in a 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.030
 little shop as you see this beautiful 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.880
 forest green in my opinion 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.610
 tate is very good as a color with the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.320
 newton or like beige then like 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.020
 see this lace around in leather 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.420
 and then instead I took it as a bag 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.660
 this one of armani jeans that this 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.420
 dark gray and interested in the coat 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.210
 you don't see the price costs 139 euros 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.010
 so around 140 but in my opinion it's worth it 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.250
 the penalty because he did a lot 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.710
 well it is very pretty 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.800
 then shows you how the hat is 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.960
 precisely I also wanted to show you the smart 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.080
 of today that I combined with the output 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.610
 because as you see this kashmir color 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.519
 This is really very nice there 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.790
 very much I find it discreetly refined 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.130
 this is chic and dior is called 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.710
 greece i think it is so pronounced 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.950
 however he writes the name on the video e 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.380
 then like jewels I wear these 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.510
 rings that I bought from and jane the 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.580
 beat and so this was the hope that 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.990
 I wanted to show you that I wanted to share 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.580
 with you today 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.350
 I hope so what details on the video of 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.290
 give me some discount on some ideas 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.090

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.669

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.470

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.680

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.120
