there is no need for God but do the

there is no need for God but do the

facts and evidences of our world really

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.640 
facts and evidences of our world really
support<00:02:10.820> evolution<00:02:13.900> let's<00:02:14.900> consider<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.620> of

support evolution let's consider one of

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.130 
support evolution let's consider one of
several<00:02:16.160> really<00:02:16.790> big<00:02:16.970> scientific<00:02:17.420> problems

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
several really big scientific problems

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.620 
several really big scientific problems
with<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.470> theory<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.800> evolution<00:02:19.360> many<00:02:20.360> times

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
with the theory of evolution many times

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.510 
with the theory of evolution many times
we<00:02:20.900> are<00:02:20.990> led<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.230> believe<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.740> there<00:02:22.310> aren't

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
we are led to believe that there aren't

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.430 
we are led to believe that there aren't
any<00:02:22.820> conflicts<00:02:23.540> between<00:02:23.720> science<00:02:24.350> and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
any conflicts between science and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.730 
any conflicts between science and
evolution<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:25.960> reality<00:02:26.960> it's<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
evolution in reality it's just the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.160 
evolution in reality it's just the
opposite<00:02:28.270> since<00:02:29.270> those<00:02:29.480> who<00:02:29.660> teach<00:02:29.840> evolution

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
opposite since those who teach evolution

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.890 
opposite since those who teach evolution
generally<00:02:30.980> reject<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.610> Bible<00:02:31.640> our<00:02:32.209> approach

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
generally reject the Bible our approach

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.930 
generally reject the Bible our approach
will<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.260> primarily<00:02:33.860> from<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.250> standpoint<00:02:34.610> of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
will be primarily from the standpoint of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.970 
will be primarily from the standpoint of
scientific<00:02:35.630> evidence<00:02:38.440> sometimes<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.770> easy

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
scientific evidence sometimes it is easy

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.250 
scientific evidence sometimes it is easy
to<00:02:40.100> accept<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.880> modern<00:02:41.239> myth<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.780> science

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
to accept the modern myth that science

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.830 
to accept the modern myth that science
is<00:02:42.380> never<00:02:42.680> wrong<00:02:42.950> or<00:02:43.760> at<00:02:43.940> least<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.750> is

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
is never wrong or at least that it is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.470 
is never wrong or at least that it is
based<00:02:45.140> solely<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.070> facts<00:02:46.610> whereas<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
based solely on the facts whereas the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240 
based solely on the facts whereas the
Bible<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.020> just<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.350> religious<00:02:48.800> book<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
Bible is just a religious book and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.030 
Bible is just a religious book and
therefore<00:02:49.700> not<00:02:49.910> scientific<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:50.950> science<00:02:51.950> is

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
therefore not scientific but science is

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.850 
therefore not scientific but science is
anything<00:02:52.459> but<00:02:52.640> perfect<00:02:53.170> science<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.560> really

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
anything but perfect science is really

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.110 
anything but perfect science is really
nothing<00:02:55.100> more<00:02:55.310> than<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.880> current

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
nothing more than the current

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.780 
nothing more than the current
interpretation<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.860> accumulation<00:02:58.700> of

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
so instead of being afraid of science we

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.819 
so instead of being afraid of science we
should<00:03:37.269> examine<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:37.989> use<00:03:38.439> it<00:03:38.469> for

should examine it and use it for

should examine it and use it for
defending<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.489> truth<00:03:40.049> today<00:03:41.049> we<00:03:41.319> want<00:03:41.500> to

defending the truth today we want to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.440 
defending the truth today we want to

is the lack of a mechanism but before we
begin<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.709> really<00:03:51.069> should<00:03:51.280> define<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.849> word

agree with this note that the philosophy

agree with this note that the philosophy
of<00:04:16.840> evolution<00:04:17.500> has<00:04:17.709> two<00:04:18.009> enormous<00:04:18.549> mountains

to<00:04:19.479> climb<00:04:20.039> first<00:04:21.039> they<00:04:21.370> must<00:04:21.400> explain<00:04:22.090> where

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
to climb first they must explain where

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.409 
to climb first they must explain where
the<00:04:22.509> very<00:04:22.750> first<00:04:23.110> life<00:04:23.410> came<00:04:23.770> from<00:04:24.070> and

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
the very first life came from and

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.670 
the very first life came from and
secondly<00:04:25.419> they<00:04:25.720> have<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.110> problem<00:04:26.590> of

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
secondly they have the problem of

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.860 
secondly they have the problem of
explaining<00:04:27.340> how<00:04:27.460> each<00:04:27.759> new<00:04:28.090> species<00:04:28.479> of

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
explaining how each new species of

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.680 
explaining how each new species of
organism<00:04:29.590> gained<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.639> new<00:04:30.849> additional

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
organism gained the new additional

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.279 
organism gained the new additional
genetic<00:04:31.840> information<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:33.039> order<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.759> evolve

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
genetic information in order to evolve

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.200 
genetic information in order to evolve
this<00:04:35.289> second<00:04:35.770> problem<00:04:35.979> is<00:04:36.370> our<00:04:36.580> theme<00:04:36.940> for

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
this second problem is our theme for

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:49.440 
this second problem is our theme for
today

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.870 

okay<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.960> lack<00:04:51.169> of<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.410> mechanism<00:04:51.730> what<00:04:52.730> does

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
okay the lack of a mechanism what does

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.900 
okay the lack of a mechanism what does
that<00:04:53.030> mean<00:04:53.950> well<00:04:54.950> if<00:04:55.280> we<00:04:55.460> can't<00:04:55.700> observe

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
that mean well if we can't observe

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.659 
that mean well if we can't observe
evolution<00:04:56.780> happening<00:04:57.260> today<00:04:57.470> then<00:04:58.400> what

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
evolution happening today then what

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.670 
evolution happening today then what
convinces<00:04:59.270> scientists<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.200> happened<00:05:00.590> in

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
convinces scientists that it happened in

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.820 
convinces scientists that it happened in
the<00:05:00.770> past<00:05:00.980> and<00:05:01.930> if<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.050> did<00:05:03.230> happen<00:05:03.440> in<00:05:03.740> the

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
the past and if it did happen in the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.870 
the past and if it did happen in the
past<00:05:03.860> what<00:05:04.820> caused<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.480> happen<00:05:06.880> if

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
past what caused it to happen if

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.210 
past what caused it to happen if
evolution<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.260> fact<00:05:09.590> that<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:10.100> many

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
evolution is the fact that so many

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.040 
evolution is the fact that so many
teachers<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.910> scientists<00:05:11.330> say<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.870> is

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
teachers and scientists say that it is

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.409 
teachers and scientists say that it is
then<00:05:12.680> they<00:05:13.010> must<00:05:13.220> either<00:05:13.430> show<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.970> happening

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
then they must either show it happening

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.659 
then they must either show it happening
today<00:05:14.570> or<00:05:14.990> at<00:05:15.350> least<00:05:15.410> tell<00:05:15.860> us<00:05:16.010> what<00:05:16.250> made<00:05:16.520> it

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
today or at least tell us what made it

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.730 
today or at least tell us what made it
happen<00:05:16.910> in<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.240> past<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:18.260> truth<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.710> that

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
happen in the past the truth is that

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:28.330 
happen in the past the truth is that
they<00:05:19.040> can't<00:05:19.310> do<00:05:19.430> either<00:05:19.580> one

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.220 

if<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.610> were<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.910> wake<00:05:29.940> up<00:05:30.300> one<00:05:30.510> day<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.810> see

if you were to wake up one day and see
