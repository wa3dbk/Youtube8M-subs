00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 Hello everyone, sir , I am now 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.240
 show you how to make your server which 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.429
 supports mods and plugins creation 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.670
 such a server is completely identical 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.230
 similar to the bucket server building which 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 only supports plugins 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.029
 but this server will also support 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 fashion 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.170
 the only difference is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.480
 between these servers what's here 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.599
 another script but also titles 1 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 and in and we introduce kapka plus already 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.809
 there is a form of blondor who upload 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.820
 the mods themselves the mods themselves that will be 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.399
 function on our server and so 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:53.370
 script and link to download the kernel 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.559
 I will leave in the description of the video we will start everything 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.719
 I keep the text of the document here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:06.390
 link to download go here this 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:09.360
 site go our browser we enter 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 search string but search here 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.510
 to address 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.900
 and choose the version we need 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.520
 don't make hasty conclusions and don't 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.630
 say what is there 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.200
 servers more precisely version 1 62 there 161 they 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.400
 There is if I look for them I found 152 this is 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.020
 what do i need so download it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.230
 artifacts recent successful builds this 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.900
 we need to download the first link she 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.140
 version 152 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.420
 so it means we create a folder where our 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:58.800
 server let it be a new folder 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.800
 create a text document 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.390
 Text Document 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:10.660
 go to it in principle close the folder 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.110
 can be further script as I said he 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.970
 different from the previous one 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:23.140
 contains fewer words than in that script 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 tanks so here we see that there is a straight 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.400
 address running hydra here well in general 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.480
 it is clear that's where they stand there bye plus 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.350
 there is a version you need to insert a version like this 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.730
 paste the whole script see that for now 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.019
 our core is downloaded 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.019
 wait a few moments 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:57.459
 left a little well lan put on 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:05.269
 pause until our our kernel has booted and 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:08.180
 transfer it to the server folder so 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.049
 all throw close our browser it 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.409
 we will no longer need to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.290
 do not suffer with this with the name of our 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.280
 kernels erase everything that is written here and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.859
 rename 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.889
 in a word convenient for you , let's start 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:35.090
 so again press and copy the name 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:39.069
 to put exactly and so here to set 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.019
 exact title in a text document 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.159
 insert all the script to run our 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.569
 server is ready now save it as 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:52.669
 let's call him 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:57.440
 start server and change the format to a point 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:04:01.489
 baht save so well and as always with us 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:06.970
 three files appear here delete 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:11.470
 text document and start the server 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.239
 core and our server version 152 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.090
 Well, we see that the console has started 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:21.289
 about load 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.110
 all danta done we roll up the console see 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.270
 that many more folders have been created here 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.409
 che unlike tanks then server 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:34.520
 let's compare this bucket server 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.729
 principle, not much but still there 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.010
 the difference is and 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.979
 and most importantly what is present here 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.260
 mods folder on server with mods 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.220
 here we will load mods 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.730
 to play well with them so let's 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:58.120
 leave our console and configure 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:01.120
 set up the properties server as usual 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.110
 we play hamachi so we write here 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 ip 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.150
 from here so we start this hamachi 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.669
 Well 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.419
 Okay, he does not want to take a run 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.419
 ip from here 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.080
 Well, in general, with you what is required is 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:36.950
 continue to insert ip through hamachi and 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.800
 change online mod strings hair after 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.070
 this can change the name to do 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.890
 its colored in my lesson like i have it 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.770
 you as I was shooting how to make color 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.990
 name but it does not matter glan 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.800
 change server settings and run 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.180
 his fight is not that, it is not that, or I have closed 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.110
 launched the usual bucket server we start 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.490
 with mods server I have now 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.080
 minecraft will not work because 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:12.220
 i hamachi turned off so i'm in 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:17.030
 maykravt will not go but the principles 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.550
 creating a server I told the installation 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:23.390
 fashion is also very simple 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.540
 download archive or file that in 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.960
 whichever you download 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:35.240
 throws the downloaded file downloaded in 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:38.090
 folder mods and all start the server it 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.110
 already given will start unpacking this file 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.920
 he himself loads it as he needs and you 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:48.950
 can already play on the server with the mod but 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.680
 know one thing about what if you 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.770
 want to play server on server like 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.190
 on which mods are installed 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:01.490
 You also need to install this mod on 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.710
 his client, that is, he does not owe anything 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.080
 differ from the fashion which stands on 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.520
 server version must be completely 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.639
 match so some 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.840
 people are surprised that they want to play 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:19.509
 on a server with a mod but with it 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.389
 have to download the whole laughter then 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.009
 there is a whole customer new and they have to 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.949
 reinstall so there is nothing here 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:29.590
 there is no wonder this is one of the important 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:32.169
 procedures that contribute to your game 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.750
 on the server that is for you creators 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.830
 servers do everything for you to play on 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.060
 their server 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.919
 Well, basically, I told you all thanks for 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.250
 attention with you was a gentleman see you soon 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.250
 meeting
