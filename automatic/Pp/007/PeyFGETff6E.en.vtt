limited<00:01:15.210> edition<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> really

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
limited edition but this is a really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
limited edition but this is a really
nice<00:01:17.610> gloss<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.450> similar<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.890> sleek

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
nice gloss and it's similar to the sleek

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.289 
nice gloss and it's similar to the sleek
lip<00:01:20.850> pout<00:01:21.560> um<00:01:22.880> think<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.150> they're

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
lip pout um think that's what they're

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840 
lip pout um think that's what they're
called<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.830> sleek<00:01:25.830> has<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.250> very<00:01:26.430> similar<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
called but sleek has not very similar to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
called but sleek has not very similar to
this<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.780> why<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> got<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.350> was

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
this and that's why I got this this was

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
this and that's why I got this this was
done<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.280> pound<00:01:29.520> fifty<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:32.400> also<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
done to pound fifty and I also have this

anyway<00:01:33.810> eyeliner<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.630> feel

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
anyway eyeliner I like this but I feel

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.280 
anyway eyeliner I like this but I feel
like<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.229> dries<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.770> quite<00:01:38.070> quickly<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
like this dries out quite quickly so I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.340 
like this dries out quite quickly so I
prefer<00:01:40.680> my<00:01:41.460> other<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.000> mua<00:01:42.329> liner<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.079> this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
prefer my other you mua liner and this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
prefer my other you mua liner and this
is<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> MUA<00:01:43.920> extreme<00:01:44.549> liner<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> feel<00:01:45.390> like

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is the MUA extreme liner and I feel like

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.940 
is the MUA extreme liner and I feel like
I<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:45.869> control<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.710> one

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
I have more control with this one

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.240 
I have more control with this one
because<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:48.299> um<00:01:49.250> unsteady

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
because I do have quite um unsteady

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
because I do have quite um unsteady
hands<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.540> gives<00:01:51.869> me<00:01:52.020> more

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
hands so this really gives me more

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
hands so this really gives me more
control<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.159> eyeliner<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.119> done

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
control over the eyeliner and it's done

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.020 
control over the eyeliner and it's done
eyeliner<00:01:55.140> pen<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> for

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
eyeliner pen and I think this is for

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.109 
eyeliner pen and I think this is for
pound<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.689> sure<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
pound I'm not sure this is the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
pound I'm not sure this is the
professional<00:02:00.630> line<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> little

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
professional line so this is a little

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
professional line so this is a little
bit<00:02:01.829> more<00:02:01.979> unless<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> pound<00:02:02.990> um<00:02:05.030> over<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.299> is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
bit more unless a pound um over here is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.859 
bit more unless a pound um over here is
another<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.890> my<00:02:08.099> favorites<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.869> MUA

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
