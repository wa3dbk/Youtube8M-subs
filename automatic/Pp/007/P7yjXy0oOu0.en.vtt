00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
time you spend a moving point you'll go

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.710 
time you spend a moving point you'll go

to spend to movement points to go one
space<00:04:34.190> north<00:04:34.580> so<00:04:34.850> it's<00:04:35.000> harder<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.360> go<00:04:35.570> against

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
new direction for the wind you get the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.409 
new direction for the wind you get the
