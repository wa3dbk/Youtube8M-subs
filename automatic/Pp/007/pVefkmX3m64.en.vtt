00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that job anyways jump in a bit into the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.780 
that job anyways jump in a bit into the
gameplay<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.630> map<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.140> Hydra<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
gameplay in this map now Hydra in the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
gameplay in this map now Hydra in the
middle<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> centerpiece

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
middle of it is kind of the centerpiece

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
middle of it is kind of the centerpiece
which<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> water<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.820> you'll<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.000> me

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
which is the water which you'll see me

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.609 
which is the water which you'll see me
run<00:01:54.420> past<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.750> couple<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.110> times<00:01:55.290> during<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
run past a couple of times during this

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
run past a couple of times during this
gameplay<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.280> every<00:01:56.670> couple<00:01:57.180> seconds<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
gameplay and every couple seconds I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
gameplay and every couple seconds I
think<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.020> every<00:01:58.350> minute<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> game

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
think it's like every minute in the game

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.899 
think it's like every minute in the game
it<00:02:00.680> one<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.890> announcers<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.579> start

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it one of the announcers like start

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
it one of the announcers like start
speaking<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> different<00:02:03.600> language<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
speaking in a different language and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.580 
speaking in a different language and
then<00:02:04.740> basically<00:02:05.570> wave<00:02:06.570> start<00:02:07.020> forming<00:02:07.439> in

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
then basically wave start forming in

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
then basically wave start forming in
that<00:02:07.619> water<00:02:08.009> area<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> when<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.879> walk<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.300> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that water area and when you walk in it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420 
that water area and when you walk in it
those<00:02:09.569> wave<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.170> instantly<00:02:10.739> drowned<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
those wave you instantly drowned and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.190 
those wave you instantly drowned and
it's<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.120> pretty<00:02:12.330> cool<00:02:12.569> little<00:02:12.660> feature

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's a pretty cool little feature

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.320 
it's a pretty cool little feature
can<00:02:13.319> play<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> chicken<00:02:14.610> with<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.819> whiz<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
can play like a chicken with a whiz and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110 
can play like a chicken with a whiz and
just<00:02:15.450> keep<00:02:15.569> jumping<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.959> way<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.700> I'm

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
just keep jumping that way of it but I'm

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
just keep jumping that way of it but I'm
not<00:02:18.209> normally<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> fan<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.440> these<00:02:19.620> kind<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> you

not normally a fan of these kind of you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.530 
not normally a fan of these kind of you
know<00:02:20.160> interactive<00:02:20.790> things<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.239> they<00:02:21.330> put

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
know interactive things that they put

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.479 
know interactive things that they put
into<00:02:21.660> begins<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.290> kill<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.560> like<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:23.099> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
into begins it can kill you like on a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.380 
into begins it can kill you like on a
downhill<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.480> example<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.019> there's<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
downhill for example is that there's a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.509 
downhill for example is that there's a
freaking<00:02:27.500> cart<00:02:28.500> thing<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.220> don't<00:02:29.459> even

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
freaking cart thing that I don't even

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.610 
freaking cart thing that I don't even
know<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:29.819> call<00:02:30.000> their<00:02:30.239> ski<00:02:30.510> carts<00:02:30.959> that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
know what they call their ski carts that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.750 
know what they call their ski carts that
pull<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.890> along<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.220> wire<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.640> it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
pull you along the wire and it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.210 
pull you along the wire and it's
basically<00:02:33.209> moving<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:33.800> two<00:02:34.800> miles<00:02:35.069> an

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
basically moving it like two miles an

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.920 
basically moving it like two miles an
hour<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.790> walk<00:02:36.000> into<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.480> kills<00:02:36.810> you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
hour and if you walk into it kills you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.070 
hour and if you walk into it kills you
instantly<00:02:37.170> which<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.769> bit<00:02:38.750> retarded<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.930> my

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
instantly which is a bit retarded in my

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.740 
instantly which is a bit retarded in my
opinion<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.880> map<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.330> definitely

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
opinion but on this map it definitely

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.199 
opinion but on this map it definitely
fits<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.170> under<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.830> map<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.370> my<00:02:44.700> opinion<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
fits it under this map in my opinion is

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.000 
fits it under this map in my opinion is
a<00:02:45.239> nicely<00:02:45.810> balanced<00:02:46.110> nice<00:02:46.349> one<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> really

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
a nicely balanced nice one so I really

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.830 
a nicely balanced nice one so I really
do<00:02:47.099> like<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.489> has<00:02:47.640> two<00:02:47.849> men's<00:02:48.090> bond<00:02:48.360> points<00:02:48.660> one

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
do like it has two men's bond points one

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.930 
do like it has two men's bond points one
at<00:02:48.959> sea<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.890> here<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:50.700> them<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
at sea one here you can get them in a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.210 
at sea one here you can get them in a
nice<00:02:51.060> trap<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.170> wish<00:02:52.380> solo<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
nice trap if you so wish solo or in a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
nice trap if you so wish solo or in a
pie<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.459> works<00:02:53.819> well<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.750> game<00:02:54.959> plays

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
pie it works well and this game plays

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.539 
pie it works well and this game plays

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
perimeter up you know didn't really talk

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.729 
perimeter up you know didn't really talk
about<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:57.480> map<00:02:57.690> there<00:02:57.870> too<00:02:58.140> much<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:58.650> the
