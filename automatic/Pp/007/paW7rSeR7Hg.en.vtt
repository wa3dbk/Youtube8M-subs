00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.509
 or the voice served the premiere of the new 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.400
 star wars maps for minecraft and the 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.020
 0.2 point 1 and well let's start 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.189
 with this map that is the map of kandy 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.439
 which is one of the maps in the 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.700
 pc maker craft servers and 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.169
 good as you can see this map is 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.110
 but very, very well done as you see it 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.939
 it looks a lot like pc is identical and in 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.860
 the chests already have objects to be able 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.969
 play directly as you can see in 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.350
 the comics there are also objects 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.789
 delighted as you can see because there 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.739
 an enchanted chest there are bows 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.850
 delighted I also think it's good 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.109
 in compositions but that of the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.399
 positions that you find in the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.019
 chests of the center something to go by 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.429
 center as you can see all the chests 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.469
 they already come with objects and can see that 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.839
 there is experience by team really that 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.219
 your enchanted weapons to see over here 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.539
 I also believe that there are enchanted weapons and 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.920
 can see a lovely sword is 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.600
 very, very cool, it 's a word 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.980
 identical to the weight and also comes with 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.019
 the typical lobby up here for 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.159
 to go to your respective island that the 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.659
 I really love making maps 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.850
 of sky war with these stories as it is 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.960
 much easier you can go to your island 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.940
 when playing with your friends and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.500
 directly you fall towards 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.850
 as you can see here almost 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 automatically enter this island and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.820
 when we are going to move to the second map 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.050
 second map of the country map that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.180
 it is also one of the maps that there are in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.710

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.870

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.610

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.700
