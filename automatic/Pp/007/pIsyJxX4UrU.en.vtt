00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and good afternoon everyone, my name is 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.330
 luis and welcome to my z7 channel 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.830
 this toy that you are seeing here is the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 project that I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.700
 in this video if not in the most 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.410
 useful world only for the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 incredible visual effects that this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.800
 it produces to me it has already been worth it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 make it good the materials that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.369
 we need are the following a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.109
 saw to cut wood anything 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.640
 that cut wood a piece of wood or 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 any material easily 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 perforable and that more or less have left 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 the batteries preferably of this type 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.529
 for space and weight issues if they have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 alkaline are going to have to recalculate the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 circuit you put me in comments and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.079
 myself or the recalculation is worth only 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.850
 it takes a motorcito the voltage gives 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.620
 same as long as we have a stack 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.780
 able to make it move we need a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 little glue led diodes this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 year something that cut a drill and a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 Welder or koetting by the way makes 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 missing is also everything here is worth a 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.879
 27 ohm resistance then what 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 first thing we're going to do is take the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.920
 wood and drill it how much it is going 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.600
 to be the drill that depends on the axis of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
 engine is valid in the case of my project 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 had a pretty big shaft worth so 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 I put a 9-bit 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 after having done the little hole 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.850
 OK 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 We cut the piece with the help of our 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.509
 secret or what they have at home does not 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 the drill does not make the 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.530
 hole vale is simply so that the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.149
 little motor lace without needing 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 use glue is it worth to fit 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.619
 second step pressure may be let 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 take our batteries let's take the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 positive one and the positive one the other 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.370
 and we're going to paste them with glue now 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.680
 we will use a little bit so as not to stain 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.570
 once we have the positives together 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.440
 let's join the negative is to say this 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.440
 part with this other 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.420
 that is the result is worth negative with 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.620
 negative now we 're going to hit on the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.620
 wooden taquito 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.719
 let's take our switch and what 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.719
 let's hit where we can 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.350
 when we have everything stuck going 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.420
 to take two positive LED diodes with 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.310
 positive and negative with negative the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 positive in the long part it is worth 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.720
 the reminder that cuts with short 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 it does not matter what else has been like this is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.700
 everything up to the same thing then this 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.120
 start spinning now let's cut 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.310
 three little heads the first one is going to be the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.250
 negative is worth it and we will take it from 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.349
 the short leg in our leds up 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.209
 the negative part of one of our 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.209
 batteries does not matter if the battery is 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.420
 is worth the negative with a negative of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.450
 just as mud is and now the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.720
 positive we will not take it to the central 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.950
 of the switch in case you do not 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.410
 have a switch have a 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.640
 switch they take it to anybody 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.640
 of the two is the same 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.580
 from the positive to the central 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.000
 and now we are going to place our 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.520
 27 ohm resistance / positive 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.070
 of the stack and either of the two 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.840
 ends that we have left of the commutator 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.370
 the resistors have no polarity 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.180
 what does it matter to place them in a 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.180
 position or another bar 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.270
 it comes out here we have it from one of the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.600
 ends worth 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.750
 towards the positive part and how can 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.750
 watch 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 it works perfectly ok we're going to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.500
 place the LEDs in vertical position 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.240
 it's worth to appear as a ring 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.460
 down here and another ring up here 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.290
 I'm not going to put it on any engine 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.240
 because I do not have engines with this hole 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.040
 it but hey this is done 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.860
 simply connect it to the motor them 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.780
 I teach mine we light 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.310
 in this case, they are the ones that 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.310
 they change color and we give them 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.650
 see this is the effect that you saw 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.320
 before we can put all the LEDs 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.150
 that we want is worth that yes there is 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.310
 than to feed them with enough voltage 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.930
 and current in this case I do not use 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.520
 of limiting resistance because the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.320
 batteries are half spent and to each 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.239
 8000 jumper is coming in this 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 case the batteries are much more 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.080
 and they loaded it is coming about 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.820
 50 so here it is made to miss his 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.410
 essence in the description of this video 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.150
 they will find more information about 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.470
 this project and if you liked the 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.180
 visual effect that this produces not 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.460
 forget to subscribe to German and you are 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.720
 up to this video comment and share 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.720
 so that people come to them
