the gold colors at first and once you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.809 
the gold colors at first and once you
switch<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> tempest<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:13.319> back<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.920> goal<00:02:14.130> we

switch the tempest or back to goal we

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.800 
switch the tempest or back to goal we
said<00:02:15.000> well<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.300> have

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
one directon our new unit in there so we

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.110 
one directon our new unit in there so we
switches<00:02:18.150> guy<00:02:18.330> over<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:19.770> silver<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.910> I'd<00:02:21.000> like

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120

to save her eyes and think of masking

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.370 
to save her eyes and think of masking
spells<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.400> he<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.239> put<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.660> choose<00:02:25.200> any

spells like he can put to choose any

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.580 
spells like he can put to choose any
mineral<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.099> write<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:28.470> going

I<00:02:35.210> replicants<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:37.020> guy's<00:02:37.230> obviously<00:02:37.470> i'm

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
I replicants this guy's obviously i'm

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.430 
I replicants this guy's obviously i'm
certain<00:02:38.910> i'll<00:02:39.120> feel<00:02:39.300> eternity<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:40.320> like

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
certain i'll feel eternity it's like

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.900 
certain i'll feel eternity it's like
right<00:02:40.620> here<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.100> him<00:02:41.190> stealing<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
right here you can see him stealing the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.820 
right here you can see him stealing the
day<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> siege<00:02:42.630> tanks<00:02:42.960> he's<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> permanency

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
day of the siege tanks he's a permanency

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.220 
day of the siege tanks he's a permanency
state<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.630> means<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> Protoss

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
state now so that means the Protoss

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.930 
state now so that means the Protoss
players<00:02:46.500> now<00:02:46.710> have<00:02:46.740> any<00:02:47.130> other<00:02:47.310> unit<00:02:47.580> that's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
players now have any other unit that's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:58.190 
players now have any other unit that's
on<00:02:48.150> any<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> race<00:02:48.690> which<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.170> very

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:32.870 

you

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.729 

we<00:03:33.880> made<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.270> of<00:03:34.300> our<00:03:34.510> rocks<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:35.170> part<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.680> the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
we made all of our rocks in part of the

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.610 
we made all of our rocks in part of the
storm

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.009 

and<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.640> effects<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.269> asset<00:03:42.659> actually

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
and the effects in this asset actually

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.839 
and the effects in this asset actually
would<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.379> have<00:03:43.500> been<00:03:43.620> possible<00:03:43.650> without<00:03:44.610> the

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
would not have been possible without the

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.880 
would not have been possible without the
VTEC<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.569> we<00:03:45.690> got<00:03:45.870> from<00:03:46.409> harbin<00:03:46.830> school

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.180 

so<00:03:52.690> pass<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.900> over<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.110> Don<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.770> is<00:03:54.950> going<00:03:55.130> to

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
so pass it over to Don it is going to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.309 
so pass it over to Don it is going to
talk<00:03:55.340> about<00:03:55.460> some<00:03:55.819> of<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.090> new<00:03:56.420> proven<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.230> the

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
talk about some of the new proven to the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:09.850 
talk about some of the new proven to the
engine

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.620 

another<00:04:10.550> thing<00:04:10.820> we're<00:04:11.000> gonna<00:04:11.150> be<00:04:11.270> working<00:04:11.390> on

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
another thing we're gonna be working on

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.410 
another thing we're gonna be working on
just<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.960> lot<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.140> units<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:12.800> desert<00:04:13.420> race

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
just a lot of units in the desert race

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.599 
just a lot of units in the desert race
that<00:04:14.660> has<00:04:14.870> snake-like<00:04:15.230> movements<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.489> we

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
that has snake-like movements so we

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.190 
that has snake-like movements so we
built<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.030> aggregation<00:04:17.510> system<00:04:18.109> to

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
built this aggregation system to

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.470 
built this aggregation system to
automatically<00:04:18.920> generate<00:04:19.040> all<00:04:19.519> these<00:04:19.730> slight

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
automatically generate all these slight

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.390 
automatically generate all these slight
movements<00:04:21.019> this<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.590> something<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.040> monitors

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
movements this is something the monitors

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.710 
movements this is something the monitors
continues<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.210> want<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.420> make<00:04:23.540> their

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
continues that you want to make their

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.090 
continues that you want to make their
own<00:04:23.750> drain

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
own drain

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.940 
own drain
obviously<00:04:26.660> we<00:04:27.660> also<00:04:27.780> have<00:04:28.170> rebuilt<00:04:28.620> the

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
obviously we also have rebuilt the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.020 
obviously we also have rebuilt the
physics<00:04:29.400> engine<00:04:29.520> will<00:04:29.940> scratch<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:31.350> now<00:04:31.530> you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
physics engine will scratch so now you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:40.570 
physics engine will scratch so now you
give<00:04:33.030> me<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.660> lot<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.140> burgers<00:04:34.890> wings<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:36.000> slo-mo

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.460 

so<00:04:41.580> others<00:04:42.120> could<00:04:42.330> also<00:04:42.510> use<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.960> physics<00:04:43.320> to

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
so others could also use the physics to

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.530 
so others could also use the physics to
do<00:04:43.560> whatever<00:04:43.740> they<00:04:43.980> need<00:04:44.190> if<00:04:44.430> for<00:04:44.790> example<00:04:44.820> one

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
do whatever they need if for example one

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.910 
do whatever they need if for example one
way<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:46.110> marine<00:04:47.010> ringing<00:04:47.520> spell<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:49.680> is

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
way to a marine ringing spell it is

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.150 
way to a marine ringing spell it is
raining<00:04:52.730> so<00:04:53.730> these<00:04:53.880> are<00:04:54.090> just
