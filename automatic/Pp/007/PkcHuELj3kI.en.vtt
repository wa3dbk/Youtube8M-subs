00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529

when<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:19.980> heard<00:00:20.160> about<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
when I first heard about it but now it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
when I first heard about it but now it
seems<00:00:21.270> less<00:00:21.600> promising<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.470> talked<00:00:22.710> about<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
seems less promising we talked about the

seems less promising we talked about the

specifically<00:00:27.539> my<00:00:27.810> understanding<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
specifically my understanding is is that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.130 
specifically my understanding is is that
it's<00:00:29.160> actually<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.699> legal<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.269> California<00:00:30.960> as

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's actually now legal in California as

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
it's actually now legal in California as
long<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.619> there's<00:00:31.890> someone<00:00:32.250> sitting<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
long as there's someone sitting in the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.549 
long as there's someone sitting in the
passenger<00:00:33.059> seat<00:00:33.390> next<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> next<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
passenger seat next to the next to the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
passenger seat next to the next to the
uh<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.430> guess<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.300> next<00:00:36.480> anybody

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
uh well I guess not really next anybody

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.459 
uh well I guess not really next anybody
uh<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:38.460> putting<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.149> Google<00:00:39.540> car<00:00:39.809> side<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
uh but putting the Google car side I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.940 
uh but putting the Google car side I
actually<00:00:41.190> tend<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.820> agree<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.950> Aubrey

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
actually tend to agree with what Aubrey

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 
actually tend to agree with what Aubrey
de<00:00:44.100> Grey<00:00:44.129> said<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.120> interview<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.719> us<00:00:45.899> at

de Grey said in an interview with us at

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.510 
de Grey said in an interview with us at
this<00:00:46.590> point<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.890> guess<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.160> probably<00:00:47.250> been<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
this point I guess it's probably been a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.180 
this point I guess it's probably been a
couple<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> years<00:00:47.910> ago<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> as

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
couple of years ago which is as

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110 
couple of years ago which is as
lifespans<00:00:50.190> grow<00:00:50.879> due<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.910> advancements<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
lifespans grow due to advancements in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
lifespans grow due to advancements in
medicine<00:00:54.390> whatever<00:00:54.690> else<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
medicine whatever else it's going to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
medicine whatever else it's going to
become<00:00:56.309> incredibly<00:00:57.239> clear<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> people

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
become incredibly clear that people

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
become incredibly clear that people
driving<00:00:58.949> cars<00:00:58.980> themselves<00:00:59.489> is<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.300> an

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
driving cars themselves is is an

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330 
driving cars themselves is is an
incredibly<00:01:00.989> risky<00:01:01.230> activity<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> should<00:01:02.250> be

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
incredibly risky activity that should be

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.969 
incredibly risky activity that should be
phased<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:02.879> together<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.799> happen<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> agree

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
phased at all together I happen to agree

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250 
phased at all together I happen to agree
with<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> first

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
with that I think that the the first

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.710 
with that I think that the the first
step<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.680> certain<00:01:08.670> highways<00:01:09.150> were<00:01:09.450> once

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
step would be certain highways were once

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
step would be certain highways were once
your<00:01:10.020> vehicle<00:01:10.560> gets<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> road<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.610> computer

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
your vehicle gets on the road a computer

in front controlling vehicles together

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450 
in front controlling vehicles together
making<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.380> less<00:01:19.799> traffic

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
making it so that we have less traffic

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.390 
making it so that we have less traffic
and<00:01:20.670> faster<00:01:21.150> speeds<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> taking<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.070> uh

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and faster speeds and taking out the uh

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.090 
and faster speeds and taking out the uh
uh<00:01:23.759> uh<00:01:23.930> risk<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.200> having<00:01:25.320> people<00:01:25.650> actually

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
uh uh risk of having people actually

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
uh uh risk of having people actually
driving<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> cars<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> eventually<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> assume

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
driving the cars and eventually I assume

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
driving the cars and eventually I assume
that<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.140> spread<00:01:28.409> beyond<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> major

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that this will spread beyond just major

that this will spread beyond just major
highways<00:01:29.790> Google's<00:01:30.720> car<00:01:30.960> specifically<00:01:31.560> I

highways Google's car specifically I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.499 
highways Google's car specifically I
don't<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.520> care<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> car

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
don't really care about the car

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.350 
don't really care about the car
specifically<00:01:34.170> beyond<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.490> idea<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
specifically beyond the idea that it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
specifically beyond the idea that it
seems<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> start<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.729> getting<00:01:38.729> into

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
seems to be the start of getting into

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.789 
seems to be the start of getting into
this<00:01:39.030> direction<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.659> talking<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.020> yeah

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
this direction I'm talking about yeah

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
this direction I'm talking about yeah
it's<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> start<00:01:41.430> obviously<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> technology

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it's the start obviously the technology

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's the start obviously the technology
has<00:01:42.720> come<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> long<00:01:43.020> way<00:01:43.320> they've<00:01:43.530> done<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> great

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
has come a long way they've done a great

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.899 
has come a long way they've done a great
job<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> cars<00:01:45.329> seeing<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.649> now

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
job with the cars seeing is there now

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.819 
job with the cars seeing is there now
legal<00:01:47.909> street<00:01:48.659> legal<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.200> you'll<00:01:49.710> never

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
legal street legal but you'll never

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.380 
legal street legal but you'll never
catch<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.490> passenger<00:01:50.970> seat<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.180> one

catch me in the passenger seat of one

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
catch me in the passenger seat of one
well<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.590> would<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.829> more

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
well now but what would be more

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770 
well now but what would be more
dangerous<00:01:53.189> being<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> passenger<00:01:54.479> seat<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
dangerous being in the passenger seat of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.359 
dangerous being in the passenger seat of
the<00:01:54.899> car<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.560> being<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> road<00:01:56.310> with

the car or just being on the road with
other<00:01:56.969> people<00:01:57.360> uh<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.799> know<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.159> a

other people uh in you know in a
self-driving<00:01:59.969> vehicle<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> problem<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
self-driving vehicle well the problem is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.149 
self-driving vehicle well the problem is
that<00:02:01.140> other<00:02:01.380> people<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.829> not<00:02:01.979> in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that other people are not in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.969 
that other people are not in
self-driving<00:02:02.640> vehicles<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.649> at<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
self-driving vehicles so I'm at the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.410 
self-driving vehicles so I'm at the
mercy<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.579> car<00:02:05.820> while<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.299> still

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
mercy of this car while there are still

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
mercy of this car while there are still
other<00:02:06.570> people<00:02:07.079> driving<00:02:07.409> around<00:02:07.619> drunk<00:02:07.890> and

than being at the mercy of the
self-driving<00:02:22.349> vehicle<00:02:22.799> is<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.159> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
self-driving vehicle is like is that the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.339 
self-driving vehicle is like is that the
real<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:23.969> reason<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.480> don't<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> in

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
real the one reason you don't like it in

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.550 
real the one reason you don't like it in
general<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.489> did<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.879> mean<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.450> did<00:02:28.379> say

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
general I I just did I mean I did say

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.110 
general I I just did I mean I did say
that<00:02:28.590> technology<00:02:29.400> has<00:02:29.430> come<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> long<00:02:29.760> way<00:02:30.060> but

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that technology has come a long way but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.399 
that technology has come a long way but
I<00:02:30.299> don't<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.599> has<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> long<00:02:31.019> way<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.230> go

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
I don't think has a long way to go

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.839 
I don't think has a long way to go
alright<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.280> there<00:02:32.430> you've<00:02:32.549> heard<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.790> from

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
alright so there you've heard it from

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.520 
alright so there you've heard it from
Louis<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.329> believe<00:02:33.659> that<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> technology<00:02:34.290> is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
Louis I believe that the technology is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.069 
Louis I believe that the technology is
still<00:02:34.890> promising<00:02:35.400> whether<00:02:36.060> Google's<00:02:36.659> car

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
still promising whether Google's car

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.289 
still promising whether Google's car
specifically<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.430> be<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.760> catalyst

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
specifically is going to be the catalyst

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.420 
specifically is going to be the catalyst
to<00:02:39.599> make<00:02:39.750> everything<00:02:40.019> happen<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.709> don't<00:02:41.310> really

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to make everything happen I don't really

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.849 
to make everything happen I don't really
know<00:02:41.639> but<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.239> fitting<00:02:42.659> in<00:02:42.840> general<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.409> am<00:02:43.500> I'm

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
know but in fitting in general I am I'm

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.220 
know but in fitting in general I am I'm
for<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.219> idea<00:02:44.609> of<00:02:44.849> taking<00:02:45.030> manual<00:02:45.720> control<00:02:46.200> of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
for the idea of taking manual control of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.679 
for the idea of taking manual control of
vehicles<00:02:46.799> away<00:02:47.340> from<00:02:47.879> people<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.389> a<00:02:48.420> weighted

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
vehicles away from people as a weighted

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.359 
vehicles away from people as a weighted
to<00:02:49.260> decrease<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.920> death<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.879> injury
