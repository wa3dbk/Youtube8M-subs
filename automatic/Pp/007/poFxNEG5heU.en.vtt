have been frozen beforehand before I got
your<00:00:45.210> plate<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.620> makes<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.980> bit

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
your plate now this makes a bit

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.709 
your plate now this makes a bit
difficult<00:00:47.280> restaurants<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.570> ask

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
difficult restaurants because you ask

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
difficult restaurants because you ask
them<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> fish<00:00:49.410> fresh<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.670> say<00:00:50.910> yes

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
them is the fish fresh and they say yes

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.880 
them is the fish fresh and they say yes
because<00:00:51.690> no<00:00:51.989> sushi<00:00:52.170> restaurant<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
because no sushi restaurant is going to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.459 
because no sushi restaurant is going to
say<00:00:53.039> no<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.460> being<00:00:53.579> frozen<00:00:54.170> because<00:00:55.170> that's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
say no it's being frozen because that's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.740 
say no it's being frozen because that's
not<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.949> want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> hear<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:57.000> some

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
not what you want to hear but also some

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.010 
not what you want to hear but also some
may<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.020> actually<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.780> for<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> ones

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
may not actually know so for the ones

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500 
may not actually know so for the ones
that<00:01:01.109> don't<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.100> could<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.000> they

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that don't know it I could be that they

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630 
that don't know it I could be that they
receive<00:01:03.899> their<00:01:04.229> fish<00:01:04.439> thought<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> sushi

grade fish provider which is frozen
beforehand<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.710> give<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> them

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
beforehand and then give it to them

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.210 
beforehand and then give it to them
forward<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.260> don't<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> they

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
forward or they just don't know and they

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
forward or they just don't know and they
go<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> fish<00:01:11.640> market<00:01:11.850> every<00:01:12.150> day<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.299> buy<00:01:12.450> a

go to a fish market every day and buy a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
go to a fish market every day and buy a
fish<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> chop<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> serve<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.299> so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
fish and chop it up and serve it up so

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
fish and chop it up and serve it up so
this<00:01:15.570> poses<00:01:15.810> quite<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> risk<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.740> eating<00:01:17.009> out

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this poses quite a risk when eating out

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
this poses quite a risk when eating out
because<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.700> can't<00:01:17.909> trust<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> way

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
because you can't trust what the way

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
because you can't trust what the way
does<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.780> telling<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.280> know

does it telling you and you don't know

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.880 
does it telling you and you don't know
what's<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> back<00:01:21.360> end<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:22.590> FDA

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
what's going on in the back end the FDA

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.010 
what's going on in the back end the FDA
recognizes<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.850> made<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> table<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
recognizes and was made a table that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
recognizes and was made a table that
lists<00:01:25.530> every<00:01:25.710> single<00:01:26.100> type<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> fish<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.729> is

lists every single type of fish there is
and<00:01:27.180> basically<00:01:27.630> tells<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> whether<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.920> risk

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and basically tells you whether the risk

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.210 
and basically tells you whether the risk
of<00:01:29.369> parasite<00:01:30.299> infection<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> high<00:01:31.350> low<00:01:31.890> or

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
fingers long also then you want to

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.810 
fingers long also then you want to
vacuum<00:05:34.510> seal<00:05:34.780> these<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:35.530> vacuum<00:05:36.370> sealing<00:05:36.580> is

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
vacuum seal these and vacuum sealing is

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.160 
vacuum seal these and vacuum sealing is
really<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.210> best<00:05:37.420> way<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.660> do<00:05:37.900> this<00:05:37.990> because

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
really the best way to do this because

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.350 
really the best way to do this because
if<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:39.220> don't<00:05:39.400> then<00:05:39.730> you<00:05:39.850> get<00:05:40.030> freeze

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
if you don't then you get freeze

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.970 
if you don't then you get freeze
apparent<00:05:40.810> when<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:41.020> freeze<00:05:41.290> your<00:05:41.470> fish<00:05:41.710> or

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
apparent when you freeze your fish or

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.910 
apparent when you freeze your fish or
you<00:05:42.850> have<00:05:43.060> migration<00:05:43.750> of<00:05:43.870> water<00:05:44.140> out<00:05:44.410> of<00:05:44.470> the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
you have migration of water out of the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.100 
you have migration of water out of the
fish<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.490> to<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.910> outside<00:05:46.360> there<00:05:46.600> is<00:05:46.690> water

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
fish and to the outside there is water

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.590 
fish and to the outside there is water
actually<00:05:47.620> moves<00:05:47.890> when<00:05:48.220> it's<00:05:48.340> frozen<00:05:48.550> it's<00:05:48.940> not

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
actually moves when it's frozen it's not

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600 
actually moves when it's frozen it's not
a<00:05:49.630> stationary<00:05:49.930> object<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:51.010> likes<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.430> go

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
a stationary object and it likes to go

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.030 
a stationary object and it likes to go
out<00:05:51.820> of<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.210> food<00:05:52.450> so<00:05:52.810> when<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.590> have<00:05:53.800> less

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
out of the food so when you have less

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.040 
out of the food so when you have less
space<00:05:54.370> around<00:05:54.760> the<00:05:55.030> outside<00:05:55.360> of<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.540> food<00:05:55.750> it

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
space around the outside of the food it

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.390 
space around the outside of the food it
sort<00:05:56.530> of<00:05:56.590> stops<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.970> water<00:05:58.180> from<00:05:58.300> leaving<00:05:58.750> it

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
sort of stops the water from leaving it

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.860 
sort of stops the water from leaving it
lastly<00:06:00.400> where<00:06:00.910> to<00:06:01.030> get<00:06:01.180> your<00:06:01.420> sushi<00:06:01.660> grade
