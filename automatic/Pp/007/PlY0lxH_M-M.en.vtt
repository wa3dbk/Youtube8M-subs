00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.560
 yes the ford mondeo maintenance for almost 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.570
 two generations ago and his car that 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.770
 we just can't forget 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.300
 at that time he stuck with his 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.550
 driving characteristics far above average 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.200
 off and there was a bit of it 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.540
 the German premium brands do that thing 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.830
 but the advantage of a mondeo is that 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.119
 your rear passengers now is not with 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.529
 raised knees in the back seat 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.419
 sit and you still have a good one 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.680
 luggage space too or you at the 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.960
 premium brands you always long to come 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 hence that mondeo is always us 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.120
 positive sentences also remembered 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.610
 you will mondeo how is it today 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 day well let me start with the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.740
 diesel 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.080
 there's another one from arising 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.960
 part-time does not work came in later 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.030
 this model with 2002 about 12 years old 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.350
 well and yes the driving characteristics what i do 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.880
 just as you may still have said 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.530
 well-being was a nice and sporty part 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.900
 but is not hard as it is anyway 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.920
 a nice comfortable family car 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.570
 and we have one to today 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.009
 collection 'execution scored 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.070
 so that means he is good at it 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.350
 stuff there is aircoat in you 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.149
 even a navigation system or I ask 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 I wonder if you were 12 years later 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.740
 always a good way to always send 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.620
 yes and apparently we were not the only one 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.940
 that mondeo above the middle class 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.410
 level of the crop 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.690
 jack oh man that back then at the ford consul 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.920
 heard his little x time from 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.460
 a large part on the technique of the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.590
 mondeo 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.660
 well they wanted the finally is the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.240
 compete with the 3 series and 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.260
 the c class and the audi a4 and they did 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.729
 noise and best store with 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.950
 four-wheel drive a set of seline 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.780
 engines but a success is that i stand i 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.430
 never been because in jeddah circles 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.320
 hazes a little nose on free 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.640
 small car 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.740
 and for those jaguar fans it became 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.080
 all much worse because of the me 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.640
 A station wagon also appeared 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.260
 and he got a diesel engine four 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.730
 cylinders 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.130
 well a thousand this one from it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.200
 First built in 2004 for always 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.330
 with a four-cylinder two liter diesel 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.350
 with 130 hp 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 and despite this being an executive 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.200
 execution is just plastic 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.900
 hubcaps 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.640
 well if there is an anti- johor then there is 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.170
 this one is and maybe it is 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.700
 makes it so fun with this copy 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.890
 it's a bit like the music party 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 just come in jeans and you 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.870
 only comes along because security 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.870
 your expensive dad 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.300
 the first thing you notice when you 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.250
 switch from the mondeo to this one 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.740
 Jaguar is that the seats a bit 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.200
 be hard and short are less 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.480
 comfortable and also the controls in this 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.580
 cars otherwise he really feels put it 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.350
 light on yes it feels a bit like 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.150
 an old xj 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.610
 so there really is really scary though 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.990
 because it says it's nice well no I do 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.430
 really 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.300
 yes further yes we have a simple one 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.380
 there are fabric covers 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.040
 piece wood plastic tree 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.590
 in it and the engine is a 2 liter diesel 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.900
 so come morally with these cars from 2004 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.460
 if you have the mondeo cup the 2004 and you also order 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.390
 a rail diesel 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.390
 now has 130 hp 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.000
 subject each other in a char 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.290
 that would be pretty fine he goes 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.690
 nice and quick beautiful like you like one 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.780
 diesel can expect and that 330mm 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.430
 understand inverted 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.640
 for the people who want more is walking 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.440
 from to 2005 bison 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.540
 maybe this car is the nicer to 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.400
 you really have it a bit 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.540
 sportier feeling what maybe in this 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.540
 car rolling belongs 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.530
 so ride a whole for so little money 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.240
 decent car 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.370
 jaguar really made good use of the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.600
 qualities of fort on the other hand 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.700
 also make it a difficult case 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.980
 hear because why would you pay more and 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.600
 surrender space or the same mondeo 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.390
 standard bidding on the other hand 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.140
 a jaguar with quality you can be there 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.140
 also difficult to leave
