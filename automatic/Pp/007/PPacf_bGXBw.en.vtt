camera thinks so and that's going to

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.710

it's going to make it flicker it's going

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.949 
it's going to make it flicker it's going

then<00:03:27.760> lock<00:03:28.359> it<00:03:28.389> in<00:03:28.690> there<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:28.900> manual<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
then lock it in there and manual and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.979 
then lock it in there and manual and
you'll<00:03:29.709> have<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:29.889> consistent<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.989> consistent

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
you'll have a consistent a consistent

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.289 
you'll have a consistent a consistent
exposure<00:03:32.440> throughout<00:03:33.190> your<00:03:33.609> video<00:03:34.060> which

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
exposure throughout your video which

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.240 
exposure throughout your video which
will<00:03:34.480> look<00:03:34.630> much<00:03:34.989> better<00:03:35.260> than<00:03:35.560> if<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.799> camera

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
will look much better than if the camera

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.920 
will look much better than if the camera
is<00:03:36.280> doing<00:03:36.700> auto<00:03:36.910> exposure<00:03:37.329> throughout<00:03:37.780> the

is doing auto exposure throughout the
video<00:03:38.730> next<00:03:39.730> up<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.630> want<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.870> also<00:03:41.079> make<00:03:41.380> sure

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
video next up you want to also make sure

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.309 
video next up you want to also make sure
your<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:42.099> always<00:03:42.639> locked<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.569> whatever

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.210 
manual exposure make sure that whatever
is<00:03:52.660> oh<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.079> camera<00:03:53.260> was<00:03:53.380> at<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.799> it's<00:03:53.950> locked

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
is oh the camera was at that it's locked

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.309 
is oh the camera was at that it's locked
in<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.700> don't<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.419> camera<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:55.959> auto

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
in it that don't have the camera in auto

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.530 
in it that don't have the camera in auto
is<00:03:56.739> 0<00:03:56.980> mode<00:03:57.310> because<00:03:57.579> then<00:03:57.819> it<00:03:57.940> can<00:03:58.090> change<00:03:58.359> the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
is 0 mode because then it can change the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.509 
is 0 mode because then it can change the
exposure<00:03:58.840> again<00:03:59.109> just<00:03:59.500> using<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.919> ISO<00:04:00.250> can

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
exposure again just using the ISO can

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.039 
exposure again just using the ISO can
come<00:04:00.700> up<00:04:00.819> and<00:04:01.000> down<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.299> that<00:04:01.419> you<00:04:01.720> don't<00:04:01.900> want

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
come up and down on that you don't want

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.780 
come up and down on that you don't want
that<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.260> happen<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.950> want<00:04:03.129> to<00:04:03.190> set<00:04:03.400> your

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
that to happen you want to set your

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.759 
that to happen you want to set your
white<00:04:04.000> balance<00:04:04.180> your<00:04:05.079> aperture<00:04:05.410> shutter

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
white balance your aperture shutter

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.789 
white balance your aperture shutter
speed<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.700> your<00:04:07.090> ISO<00:04:07.510> settings<00:04:07.959> all<00:04:08.079> manually

speed and your ISO settings all manually

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.770 
speed and your ISO settings all manually
so<00:04:08.980> they're<00:04:09.250> locked<00:04:09.519> in<00:04:09.879> so<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:10.389> can<00:04:10.540> set

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
so they're locked in so that you can set

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.839 
so they're locked in so that you can set
them<00:04:10.959> correctly<00:04:11.349> take<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> test<00:04:12.370> clip<00:04:12.609> make

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
them correctly take a test clip make

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.970 
them correctly take a test clip make
sure<00:04:13.000> everything's<00:04:13.449> right<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.900> then<00:04:14.379> leave

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
sure everything's right and then leave

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.800 
sure everything's right and then leave
them<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.340> place<00:04:15.579> for<00:04:16.090> your<00:04:16.180> video<00:04:16.449> so<00:04:16.690> that

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
them to place for your video so that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.330 
them to place for your video so that
you're<00:04:16.900> not<00:04:17.139> going<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.530> have<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.859> camera

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
you're not going to have the camera

you're not going to have the camera
making<00:04:18.519> changes<00:04:19.090> during<00:04:19.419> your<00:04:19.660> video<00:04:19.959> use<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
making changes during your video use a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.130 
making changes during your video use a
tripod<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.700> is<00:04:21.849> one<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.240> no-brainers

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
tripod this is one of the no-brainers

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.510 
tripod this is one of the no-brainers
one<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.409> the<00:04:23.469> easiest<00:04:23.830> things<00:04:24.099> do<00:04:24.250> make<00:04:24.400> your

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
one of the easiest things do make your

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.520 
one of the easiest things do make your
video<00:04:24.760> look<00:04:24.969> better<00:04:25.150> use<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.659> tripod<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.409> you're

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
video look better use a tripod if you're

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.420 
video look better use a tripod if you're
in<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.650> situation<00:04:26.830> where<00:04:27.280> you

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
in a situation where you

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.400 
in a situation where you
can<00:04:27.580> for<00:04:28.030> instance<00:04:28.090> right<00:04:28.479> now<00:04:28.660> my<00:04:28.960> cameras<00:04:29.289> on

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
can for instance right now my cameras on

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.870 
can for instance right now my cameras on
a<00:04:29.470> tripod<00:04:29.500> filming<00:04:30.280> me<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:30.580> kind<00:04:30.759> of<00:04:30.789> a

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
a tripod filming me it's kind of a

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.900 
a tripod filming me it's kind of a
no-brainer<00:04:31.090> it's<00:04:32.050> going<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.199> make<00:04:32.350> sure<00:04:32.410> that

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
no-brainer it's going to make sure that

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.210 
no-brainer it's going to make sure that
nothing's<00:04:33.910> moving<00:04:34.720> jittering<00:04:35.410> in<00:04:35.680> your<00:04:35.919> video

while your video shooting and as I said

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.020 
while your video shooting and as I said
test<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.229> with<00:04:53.259> a<00:04:53.650> test<00:04:53.949> clip<00:04:54.250> when<00:04:54.880> you've

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
test it with a test clip when you've

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.960 
test it with a test clip when you've
checked<00:04:55.360> your<00:04:55.770> shutter<00:04:56.770> speed<00:04:56.830> your<00:04:57.550> aperture

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970
