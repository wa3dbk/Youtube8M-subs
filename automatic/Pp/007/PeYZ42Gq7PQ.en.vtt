00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:23.329
 Then you came in and played there. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.600
 So there 's my friend from the clinic owner. 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:33.030
 in which there is not one of us 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.060
 I will leave in the lurch also a game I 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 I have and in the recall in four classes in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.310
 four groups there is the two or three 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.860
 days in games 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.329
 the itf 21 day that is 32 and also me 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.789
 I think it has more to work with tear 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.700
 four options that is the maniche 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.430
 'champions' anp 2 and itaquÃ¡ 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.210
 different at the time that I just do not have until 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.910
 to the coast but those who have young also 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 finding more free to play and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.540
 people will like even a game that you 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.910
 Do you like to see a work of the time here? 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.610

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.489
 have a definition stated verbeek does not give 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.489
 in a matter that the obvious mi6 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.860
 I think neither layout 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.050
 so the tip is now, so you said 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.700

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.209
