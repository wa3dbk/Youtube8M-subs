outputs on that one 1 2.5 amp and ones
one<00:00:32.029> amp<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:32.509> you<00:00:32.599> can<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:33.020> know<00:00:33.110> get<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.290> fast

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
one amp so you can you know get a fast

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.650 
one amp so you can you know get a fast
charge<00:00:33.770> going<00:00:33.980> on<00:00:34.100> with<00:00:34.250> that<00:00:34.280> one<00:00:34.540> 9600<00:00:35.540> is

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
charge going on with that one 9600 is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.150 
charge going on with that one 9600 is
pretty<00:00:36.050> good<00:00:36.200> amount<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:36.680> then<00:00:37.010> there's

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
pretty good amount and then there's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.620 
pretty good amount and then there's
another<00:00:37.190> form<00:00:37.790> factor<00:00:38.090> here<00:00:38.270> as<00:00:38.360> well<00:00:38.480> that

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
another form factor here as well that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.660 
another form factor here as well that
also<00:00:38.870> comes<00:00:39.050> with<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.260> flashlight<00:00:39.410> if<00:00:40.399> you<00:00:40.489> want

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
also comes with a flashlight if you want

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.819 
also comes with a flashlight if you want
USB<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:41.300> is<00:00:41.420> 2,000<00:00:41.989> milliamp<00:00:42.380> hours<00:00:42.620> so

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
USB and this is 2,000 milliamp hours so

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.100 
USB and this is 2,000 milliamp hours so
a<00:00:43.010> lot<00:00:43.550> of<00:00:43.579> different<00:00:43.640> options<00:00:44.149> there<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.600> don't

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
a lot of different options there I don't

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
a lot of different options there I don't
want<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.290> move<00:00:45.380> on<00:00:45.470> over<00:00:45.650> take<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.860> look<00:00:45.890> at<00:00:46.040> some

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
want to move on over take a look at some

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.490 
want to move on over take a look at some
of<00:00:46.190> these<00:00:46.310> this<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.940> really<00:00:47.390> good<00:00:47.510> idea<00:00:47.660> you

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
of these this is a really good idea you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.990 
of these this is a really good idea you
plug<00:00:48.680> one<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:48.890> these<00:00:48.980> in<00:00:49.160> you<00:00:49.430> no<00:00:49.550> longer<00:00:49.700> have

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
plug one of these in you no longer have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.550 
plug one of these in you no longer have
to<00:00:50.150> worry<00:00:50.180> about<00:00:50.480> using<00:00:50.930> up<00:00:51.020> on<00:00:51.140> your<00:00:51.260> power

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
to worry about using up on your power

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.470 
to worry about using up on your power
plugs<00:00:52.310> on<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.490> wall<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.880> then<00:00:53.240> you've<00:00:53.360> got<00:00:53.390> a

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
plugs on the wall and then you've got a

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.510 
plugs on the wall and then you've got a
one<00:00:54.020> point<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.260> lamp<00:00:54.440> charger<00:00:54.830> hopefully

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
one point I lamp charger hopefully

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.860 
one point I lamp charger hopefully
they'll<00:00:55.670> release<00:00:55.880> another<00:00:56.120> one<00:00:56.300> with<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.450> 2.5

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
they'll release another one with a 2.5

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.750 
they'll release another one with a 2.5
amp<00:00:57.110> that<00:00:57.290> would<00:00:57.380> be<00:00:57.440> amazing<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.040> then<00:00:58.610> one

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
amp that would be amazing and then one

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.240 
amp that would be amazing and then one
other<00:00:58.850> good<00:00:59.060> idea<00:00:59.329> over<00:00:59.540> here<00:01:00.010> same<00:01:01.010> plug

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
other good idea over here same plug

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.340 
other good idea over here same plug
except<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:01.880> one's<00:01:02.090> swivel<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:02.720> you<00:01:03.140> put<00:01:03.290> it

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
except this one's swivel so you put it

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.109 
except this one's swivel so you put it
in<00:01:03.440> there<00:01:03.560> it's<00:01:03.680> got<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.829> USB<00:01:04.070> on<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.430> side<00:01:04.670> to

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
in there it's got a USB on the side to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.550 
in there it's got a USB on the side to
stay<00:01:05.269> out<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.540> way<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.869> then<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.439> can

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
stay out of the way and then you can

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.899 
stay out of the way and then you can
rotate<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.070> entire<00:01:07.369> thing<00:01:07.549> I<00:01:07.640> can't<00:01:07.820> really

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
rotate this entire thing I can't really

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.210 
rotate this entire thing I can't really
rotate<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.329> right<00:01:08.450> now<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.960> will<00:01:09.290> swivel

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
rotate it right now but it will swivel

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.700 
rotate it right now but it will swivel
and<00:01:10.490> spend<00:01:10.850> ah<00:01:11.060> make<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.899> work<00:01:12.020> there<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.619> go

face is being twisted oh it's Arnold
Schwarzenegger<00:01:21.260> there<00:01:21.920> are<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.040> few<00:01:22.190> options

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
Schwarzenegger there are a few options

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.030 
Schwarzenegger there are a few options
here<00:01:22.790> these<00:01:23.150> are<00:01:23.210> interesting<00:01:23.750> ideas<00:01:24.110> that's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
here these are interesting ideas that's

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.830 
here these are interesting ideas that's
kind<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.370> step<00:01:25.550> above<00:01:25.640> GE<00:01:26.030> should<00:01:26.330> charge

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
kind of a step above GE should charge

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.140 
kind of a step above GE should charge
faster<00:01:27.110> than<00:01:27.350> cheap<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:27.650> we<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:27.830> some

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
faster than cheap but we have some

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.820 
faster than cheap but we have some
pseudo<00:01:29.150> wireless<00:01:29.600> charging<00:01:29.900> solutions<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.799> I

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
pseudo wireless charging solutions and I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.870 
pseudo wireless charging solutions and I
say<00:01:30.950> pseudo<00:01:31.190> because<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.729> have<00:01:31.850> a

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
say pseudo because you have to have a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.660 
say pseudo because you have to have a
case<00:01:32.120> like<00:01:32.299> this<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.350> get<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> case<00:01:33.920> for

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
case like this so you get a case for

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.240 
case like this so you get a case for
your<00:01:34.760> phone<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.540> then<00:01:36.049> on<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.229> back<00:01:36.350> there's

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
your phone and then on the back there's

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.030 
your phone and then on the back there's
a<00:01:37.370> magnetized<00:01:38.360> charging<00:01:38.870> area<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:39.920> that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
a magnetized charging area and then that
