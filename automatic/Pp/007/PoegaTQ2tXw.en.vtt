up against a base that you guys have
seen<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.860> attack<00:00:44.219> before<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.480> very

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.690 
seen me attack before it's a very very
common<00:00:46.170> base<00:00:46.530> we're<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.460> able<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
common base we're going to be able to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
common base we're going to be able to
lure<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> clan<00:00:48.270> castle<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.719> hope<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.770> looks<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
lure the clan castle I hope it looks a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
lure the clan castle I hope it looks a
little<00:00:50.250> different<00:00:50.550> than<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> guess<00:00:52.140> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
little different than now I guess it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.889 
little different than now I guess it's
the<00:00:52.379> same<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.949> base<00:00:53.160> normally<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.910> exactly

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the same this base normally is exactly

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.540 
the same this base normally is exactly
like<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> clan<00:00:55.590> castle<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> little

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
like this the clan castle is a little

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
like this the clan castle is a little
pushed<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.270> towards<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> top<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
pushed up towards the top right so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349 
pushed up towards the top right so
you're<00:00:58.920> usually<00:00:59.160> able<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> lure<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> clan

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
you're usually able to lure the clan

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.049 
you're usually able to lure the clan
castle<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.109> cannon<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
castle on this cannon right here so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910 
castle on this cannon right here so
let's<00:01:03.270> go<00:01:03.449> we're<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> lure<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
let's go we're going to lure that and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380 
let's go we're going to lure that and
then<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.189> should<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.460> able<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> drag<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> clan

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
then we should be able to drag the clan

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
then we should be able to drag the clan
castle<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.409> top<00:01:07.740> corner<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
castle up here to this top corner and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
castle up here to this top corner and
we'll<00:01:09.360> kill<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.439> will

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
we'll kill it there and then we will

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
we'll kill it there and then we will
proceed<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.520> our<00:01:11.549> raid<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.119> always<00:01:12.720> we're

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
going to use a jump to get into the core

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.149 
going to use a jump to get into the core
that<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> key<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.840> base<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.710> really

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that is the key on this base you really

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.550 
that is the key on this base you really
want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> use<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> jump<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> core<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
want to use that jump on the core you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.230 
want to use that jump on the core you
also<00:01:19.740> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> try<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> avoid<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.729> giant

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240

bombs<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.130> around<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> core

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
bombs that are in and around the core

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 
bombs that are in and around the core
those<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.840> devastating<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
those really are devastating on this

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.640 
those really are devastating on this
base<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> well-made<00:01:27.960> base<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
base this is well-made base it's a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
base this is well-made base it's a
common<00:01:29.040> base<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.460> an<00:01:29.549> overused<00:01:30.060> base<00:01:30.390> but

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
common base it's an overused base but

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.260 
common base it's an overused base but
it's<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.229> base<00:01:31.820> alright<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:32.970> let's<00:01:33.150> get

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's a good base alright so let's get

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.100 
it's a good base alright so let's get
going<00:01:33.500> I'm<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.740> drop<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:35.070> golems<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
going I'm going to drop our golems and

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.690

that's<00:05:09.890> basically<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.760> think<00:05:11.570> we<00:05:11.690> will<00:05:11.840> get

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
that's basically it I think we will get

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.000 
that's basically it I think we will get
the<00:05:12.080> town<00:05:12.260> all<00:05:12.440> just<00:05:12.830> fine<00:05:13.690> so<00:05:14.690> come<00:05:15.680> on<00:05:15.800> guys

see I think I can get the Town Hall fine

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.080 
see I think I can get the Town Hall fine

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
because the archer queen is pretty close

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.230 
because the archer queen is pretty close

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
for so let's use the archer Queen

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.590 
for so let's use the archer Queen
ability<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.670> then<00:05:40.760> basically<00:05:40.970> get<00:05:41.330> out<00:05:41.450> of

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
ability and then basically get out of

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.030 
ability and then basically get out of
here<00:05:41.690> so<00:05:41.930> yeah<00:05:42.140> we<00:05:42.290> didn't<00:05:42.530> use<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.680> lot<00:05:43.010> of

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
here so yeah we didn't use a lot of

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.570 
here so yeah we didn't use a lot of
troops<00:05:43.340> we<00:05:43.900> wow<00:05:44.900> we<00:05:44.960> saved<00:05:45.680> like<00:05:45.920> 30-something

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
troops that's probably not good i

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.900 
troops that's probably not good i
probably<00:05:48.800> should<00:05:48.980> have<00:05:49.040> changed<00:05:49.400> those<00:05:49.700> for

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
probably should have changed those for

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.150 
probably should have changed those for
something<00:05:50.210> else<00:05:50.330> but<00:05:50.510> i<00:05:51.020> was<00:05:51.530> ready<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:51.830> attack
