00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 beautiful all guys here orgasmic with the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.750
 third episode of tottenham based 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 I remember this is an episode that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.400
 comes out either on a yes day or a no day 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.090
 so stay connected for many 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.880
 episodes 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 therefore in this episode an episode 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 quite 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.080
 how to say though not beautiful before 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.939
 talk about the need for you I want to do 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.600
 a kind of announcement let's say one 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.300
 sale 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 I have decided to put on sale 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.070
 credits or about 700 or even 800 thousand 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.530
 credits to sell 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 I wanted to get rid of it a bit since in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.010
 I'm not doing anything about it right now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.680
 since I go on vacation then I have 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.610
 decided to sell them I sell 100,000 credits 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 at 8 euros a very fair price I have to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.370
 say obviously maximum security one hundred 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.100
 percent sure because in any case me 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.410
 you know no truffaut anyone either 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.449
 because I am the admin of a forum or one of the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.820
 most important forums in Italy 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 a channel of a thousand passers signed up 15 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.030
 years is not even very smart 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.189
 cheat people however paying 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.439
 via paypal or even top-up 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.180
 postpay you see it and send me a 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.159
 private message if you are interested 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.009
 here I also like the forum 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.170
 however we talk about the game la 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.810
 first match of course here 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.560
 just stones because I have ps3 not 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.509
 send me messages if you have xbox or opc 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.009
 here, however, pay the game in 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.109
 against an opponent who had one 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.349
 very strong team but it was a culattone 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:39.310
 of the madonna this game I lose 5 

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:42.409
 a 1 just because he had an attack 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.409
 very good but above all I had one 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.069
 incredibly ridiculous defense 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.259
 no excuse 52 lose because oh well 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.770
 however I only have two players there 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.920
 only a gold player in defense to 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.149
 the rest is bronze including the goalkeeper 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.469
 goalkeeper in this game is not really 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.969
 a socket and then precisely decide to 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.369
 change goalkeeper the undecided king between 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.410
 cudicini and friedel then I got friedel 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.690
 why cudicini aside that silver 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.900
 it cost 41600 something like that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.120
 so I decided to take friedel 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.120
 without a contract then it comes to them 1 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.720
 here's the first game was a 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.250
 very negative match in addition to the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.440
 defeat but above all because it 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.940
 very bad ollier rebound was going 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.139
 adversary 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.669
 every nation was a goal and above all 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.560
 so all the steps were wrong 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.329
 the players stripped me all past 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.519
 but not those brondo also those gold 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:45.109
 without distinction it was truly one 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.299
 bad game to play here anyway 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.400
 I make some changes decided to put 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.329
 the great symbol in attack though 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.880
 it will not be effective this 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.919
 choice that is good against anyway 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.849
 an opponent that a team say a 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.919
 a little more on a par with so many gold players 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.810
 in defense to half a bronze I succeed in 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.000
 find the advantage immediately with gareth 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.870
 bale with a goal that rebounded if not 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.609
 mistake on a defender's leg 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.209
 in fact he climbed over the goalkeeper and then 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.069
 with this fine goal by doninelli who 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.930
 should be the playmaker indeed 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.090
 midfielder closed as playmaker 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.340
 Italian seems of the modena then 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.100
 the opponent disconnects a little at random 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.840
 and I win very few credits as you know 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.310
 when the opponent disconnects 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.150
 a few credits are always won, however 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.290
 arrival at 6 points in this match was 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.400
 been dejected defoe incomprehensibly 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.000
 all the computer had done then 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.220
 I decide to buy adebayor for 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.959
 replace it in this game for 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.000
 adebayor turns out to be truly a 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.040
 very very poor player e 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.900
 very slow ball control of a sloth 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.760
 lame and type 85 of physicality that one does not 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.019
 he feels he has 42 because every 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.739
 contrast loses balloon I do not know what to say 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:08.069
 however, there are no other attackers 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.510
 so you have to keep this anyway 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.530
 third and final match against one 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.569
 opponent that a team really 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.639
 strong especially in attack to three 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.109
 players do not say buggy but very over 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.489
 power a giovinco jovetic palacio are 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.209
 very fast, however, this I place myself some 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.449
 Granqvist 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.789
 oh well a guy passed under his legs a 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.650
 three of my players this shot a lot 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.130
 as lucky as it was not much 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.659
 lucky this goal indeed a lot goal 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.970
 difficult to do especially because 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.400
 dembelÃ© is a two- handed left- handed southpaw 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.080
 stars instead weak then right does 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.919
 little and no law I managed to 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.740
 take and score goals come penalty 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.380
 quite questionable that turned into 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.909
 net da palacio questionable rigor because 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.650
 I went out with the goalkeeper I got the ball 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.159
 I also took the man but I took it 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.260
 also ball so I wouldn't know if it was 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.510
 penalty however comes with a draw 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.760
 kabul to an adversary with his agility 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.440
 manages to get past my defenders 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.770
 bronze that are immobile 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.260
 but then incredibly after the goal of 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.750
 giovinco take ball with bale that pulls 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.520
 a bomb under the right-hand intersection mi 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.289
 leads to 3 to 3 and makes me win 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.510
 I was joking it makes me equal this 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.940
 game gives me a point that brings me 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.810
 at 10 points 1520 credits approximately then me 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.849
 missing 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.759
 ah no sorry they are seven points missing 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.740
 missing six points to win is that 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.810
 that we will try to do in the next 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.909
 episode point I give you appointment 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.990
 the day after tomorrow I invite you to be a nice me 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.820
 piaccione 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.620
 a hitch is obviously the inscription 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.030
 channel if you haven't done it yet 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.030
 nice guys
