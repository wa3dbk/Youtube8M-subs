how<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> edited<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.710> smoke<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.250> very

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
how this is edited but the smoke is very

light<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.779> 60<00:00:31.320> seconds<00:00:31.800> what<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.579> suggests

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
light for 60 seconds what that suggests

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
light for 60 seconds what that suggests
is<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.989> fire<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:35.059> become<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:37.040> raging

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
is that the fire did not become a raging

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
is that the fire did not become a raging
fire<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.670> about<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> minute<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:39.690> would<00:00:39.899> mean

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
fire for about a minute which would mean

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
fire for about a minute which would mean
that<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.559> occupants<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.670> vehicle

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that the two occupants in the vehicle

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.170 
that the two occupants in the vehicle
would<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:42.750> 60<00:00:43.230> seconds<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.879> if

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
would have had 60 seconds to get out if

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
would have had 60 seconds to get out if
they<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:46.860> don't<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.129> what

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
they could have we don't know what

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
they could have we don't know what
happened<00:00:47.730> nobody<00:00:48.300> saw<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.110> were
