00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
going to instead of in my video I
explained<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> high-horsepower<00:00:57.629> car

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
explained how in a high-horsepower car

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
explained how in a high-horsepower car
like<00:00:58.350> mine<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.859> launching<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.340> something

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
like mine I'm launching at something

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.529 
like mine I'm launching at something
like<00:00:59.730> 2,000<00:01:00.329> rpms<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.960> rev<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.250> about<00:01:02.760> 3,000

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
like 2,000 rpms I rev it to about 3,000

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.630 
like 2,000 rpms I rev it to about 3,000
so<00:01:03.780> I've<00:01:03.899> given<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.439> gas<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:06.119> 3,000<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.640> right

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so I've given a gas to 3,000 and right

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.060 
so I've given a gas to 3,000 and right
when<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> hit<00:01:09.119> 3000<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.110> dropped<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> clutch

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
when I hit 3000 I dropped the clutch

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.570 
when I hit 3000 I dropped the clutch
very<00:01:11.510> quickly<00:01:13.130> boom<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.310> revving<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
very quickly boom so revving it up to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
very quickly boom so revving it up to
3,000

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.639 

drop<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.149> clutch<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> drop

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
drop the clutch and right when I drop

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.410 
drop the clutch and right when I drop
the<00:01:22.799> clutch<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.460> full<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> gas

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the clutch I'm gonna be full on the gas

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.010 
the clutch I'm gonna be full on the gas
and<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.920> power<00:01:26.329> combined<00:01:27.329> with<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.810> rear

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and that power combined with my rear

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.450 
and that power combined with my rear
wheel<00:01:28.140> drive<00:01:28.320> car<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.890> case<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
wheel drive car and in this case when it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.800 
wheel drive car and in this case when it
is<00:01:29.640> rainy<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> create<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.009> burnout

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
is rainy is going to create the burnout

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.719 
is rainy is going to create the burnout
I'm<00:01:33.810> doing<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.039> raining<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I'm doing this when it is raining it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.120 
I'm doing this when it is raining it
makes<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> easier<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.530> road<00:01:37.710> surface

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
makes it easier because the road surface

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
makes it easier because the road surface
is<00:01:38.159> slippery<00:01:38.580> er<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.149> can<00:01:39.270> spin<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> tires

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is slippery er so you can spin the tires

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.139 
is slippery er so you can spin the tires
easier<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.860> does<00:01:41.189> less<00:01:41.399> damage<00:01:41.429> on<00:01:42.030> your

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
easier it also does less damage on your

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.999 
easier it also does less damage on your
tires<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> great<00:01:43.079> thing<00:01:43.289> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> dry

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
tires which is a great thing in the dry

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
tires which is a great thing in the dry
it's<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.179> be<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.509> bit<00:01:45.630> more

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it's going to be a little bit more

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's going to be a little bit more
difficult<00:01:46.170> depending<00:01:46.439> upon<00:01:46.649> how<00:01:47.280> powerful

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
difficult depending upon how powerful

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
difficult depending upon how powerful
your<00:01:47.880> car<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.170> general<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.070> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
your car is but in general it's just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
your car is but in general it's just
going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.270> throttle

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
going to be a little bit more throttle

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
going to be a little bit more throttle
response<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.470> maybe<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.740> quicker<00:01:53.039> release<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
response and maybe a quicker release of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.660 
response and maybe a quicker release of
the<00:01:53.729> clutch<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.830> try<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.250> make<00:01:56.399> as

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the clutch so here we go try to make as

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
the clutch so here we go try to make as
little<00:01:57.000> things<00:01:57.209> around<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.690> as<00:01:57.840> possible

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
little things around you as possible

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.340 
little things around you as possible
poles<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> stuff<00:01:59.549> keep<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.179> minimum

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
poles and stuff keep it to a minimum

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.399 
poles and stuff keep it to a minimum
unless<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.100> talented<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:04.170> next

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
unless you're really talented the next

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.139 
unless you're really talented the next
thing<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.709> if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.069> do<00:02:05.310> start<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.849> sideways

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
thing is if you do start going sideways

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.930 
thing is if you do start going sideways
you<00:02:06.689> want<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.990> keep<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.280> counter<00:02:08.700> steer

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
you want to keep you can counter steer

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.240 
you want to keep you can counter steer
and<00:02:09.239> stuff<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.049> main<00:02:10.080> thing<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:11.099> off

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and stuff but the main thing is get off

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.030 
and stuff but the main thing is get off
the<00:02:11.430> throttle<00:02:11.959> immediately<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.590> let<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.890> go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the throttle immediately just let it go

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.970 
the throttle immediately just let it go
if<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:15.030> try<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.360> slam<00:02:15.569> on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> brakes<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.410> put

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
if you try to slam on the brakes and put

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.500 
if you try to slam on the brakes and put
a<00:02:17.010> whole<00:02:17.190> bunch<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.430> inputs<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.970> might<00:02:18.360> make

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
a whole bunch of inputs you might make

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.900 
a whole bunch of inputs you might make
it<00:02:18.630> worse<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.500> when<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.130> start<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.640> sideways

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
it worse so when I start going sideways

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.780 
it worse so when I start going sideways
I<00:02:21.420> kind<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.989> loosen<00:02:22.500> my<00:02:22.620> grip<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.459> steering

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
I kind of loosen my grip in the steering

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
I kind of loosen my grip in the steering
wheel<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.840> turn<00:02:24.989> whichever

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
wheel so it can kind of turn whichever

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.699 
wheel so it can kind of turn whichever
way<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.739> needs<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:27.560> release<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
way it needs to and I release the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.349 
way it needs to and I release the
throttle<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.160> never<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.209> place

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
throttle I never do this in a place

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.180 
throttle I never do this in a place
where<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.780> could<00:02:31.200> crash<00:02:31.410> into<00:02:31.590> things<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.070> I'm

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
where I could crash into things if I'm

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
where I could crash into things if I'm
going<00:02:32.430> sideways<00:02:32.609> so<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.049> go

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
going sideways so I'm not going to go

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.930 
going sideways so I'm not going to go
over<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.680> don't<00:02:34.859> want<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.310> encourage<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
over that I don't want to encourage you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.210 
over that I don't want to encourage you
to<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.329> so<00:02:36.569> do<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.930> where<00:02:37.109> it's<00:02:37.680> open<00:02:37.829> I'm

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
to do that so do it where it's open I'm

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.400 
to do that so do it where it's open I'm
going<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> try<00:02:38.609> maybe<00:02:38.790> 3,000<00:02:39.450> rpms<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.989> see

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
going to try maybe 3,000 rpms and see

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860 
going to try maybe 3,000 rpms and see
what<00:02:40.530> happens<00:02:40.799> then<00:02:41.549> I'm<00:02:41.819> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.359> release

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
what happens then I'm going to release

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.920 
what happens then I'm going to release
the<00:02:43.019> clutch<00:02:43.200> bolt<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.280> gas<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.930> you're

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the clutch bolt on the gas and you're

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.000 
the clutch bolt on the gas and you're
going<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.109> notice<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.500> car<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.829> going<00:02:46.950> to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
going to notice the car is going to

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.949 
going to notice the car is going to
start<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.340> squirm<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.420> I'm<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.690> turn<00:02:48.810> my

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
start to squirm so I'm going to turn my

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.840 
start to squirm so I'm going to turn my
hands<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.410> little<00:02:49.950> bit<00:02:50.040> left<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.340> right<00:02:50.549> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
hands a little bit left and right to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.940 
hands a little bit left and right to
counter<00:02:51.209> steer<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.959> what<00:02:52.170> not<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.380> all<00:02:53.280> clear

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
counter steer but what not so all clear

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.710 
counter steer but what not so all clear
and<00:02:55.950> wiper<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.459> real<00:02:56.700> quick<00:02:56.940> give<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.540> some<00:02:57.660> gas

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.110 

all<00:03:02.720> right<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:04.340> was<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.519> burnout<00:03:04.879> are

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
all right so that was a burnout are

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.970 
all right so that was a burnout are
spinning<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.510> rear<00:03:05.629> tires<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.140> was<00:03:06.590> going

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
spinning the rear tires I was going

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.699 
spinning the rear tires I was going
forward<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.819> did<00:03:08.420> not<00:03:08.569> do<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> standing<00:03:09.409> still

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
forward I did not do a standing still

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.600 
forward I did not do a standing still
burnout<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:11.840> gives<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:13.280> basic

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
burnout but that gives you the basic

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.619 
burnout but that gives you the basic
idea<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:15.170> how<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.410> do<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.610> again<00:03:17.060> try<00:03:17.569> to

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
idea of how to do it so again try to

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.970 
idea of how to do it so again try to
control<00:03:17.959> off<00:03:18.640> put<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.700> car<00:03:19.849> in<00:03:19.940> first<00:03:20.030> gear

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
control off put the car in first gear

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.680 
control off put the car in first gear
I'm<00:03:21.980> gonna<00:03:22.129> rev<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.670> about<00:03:22.790> 3,000<00:03:23.330> rpms

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
I'm gonna rev it up to about 3,000 rpms

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.940 
I'm gonna rev it up to about 3,000 rpms
could<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:24.019> slightly<00:03:24.230> different<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.650> your<00:03:24.769> car

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
could be slightly different in your car

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.170 
could be slightly different in your car
you<00:03:25.099> might<00:03:25.190> need<00:03:25.400> more<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.700> might<00:03:25.849> need<00:03:25.970> less

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you might need more you might need less

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.309 
you might need more you might need less
and<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.720> I'm<00:03:26.780> going<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.959> dump<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.200> clutch

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
and then I'm going to dump the clutch

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.309 
and then I'm going to dump the clutch
pretty<00:03:27.739> quickly<00:03:28.599> I'm<00:03:29.599> gonna<00:03:29.750> try<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.930> hold<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
pretty quickly I'm gonna try to hold the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.089 
pretty quickly I'm gonna try to hold the
steering<00:03:30.530> wheel<00:03:30.769> straight

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
steering wheel straight

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.690 
steering wheel straight
putting<00:03:31.519> minor<00:03:31.849> inputs<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.459> I'm<00:03:34.459> going<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.640> be

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
putting minor inputs and I'm going to be

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.849 
putting minor inputs and I'm going to be
full<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.420> throttle<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.709> we<00:03:36.799> go

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.500

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
right at the end there my scar started

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.569 
right at the end there my scar started
to<00:03:44.599> get<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> little<00:03:44.870> bit<00:03:45.140> sideways<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.829> let<00:03:46.370> off

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
to get a little bit sideways I let off

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.680 
to get a little bit sideways I let off
the<00:03:46.790> gas<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.959> stop<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.739> burnout<00:03:49.129> and<00:03:49.569> it<00:03:50.569> was

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
the gas to stop the burnout and it was

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.780 
the gas to stop the burnout and it was
fine<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.959> was<00:03:51.349> not<00:03:51.590> worried<00:03:52.129> at<00:03:52.310> all<00:03:52.370> about

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
fine I was not worried at all about

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.930

losing<00:03:53.510> control<00:03:53.540> it's<00:03:54.530> all<00:03:54.920> about<00:03:55.430> being

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
losing control it's all about being

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.270 
losing control it's all about being
smooth<00:03:56.329> when<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.290> start<00:03:57.560> getting<00:03:57.709> swirling

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
smooth when you start getting swirling

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.940 
smooth when you start getting swirling
going<00:03:58.519> sideways<00:03:58.760> ease<00:03:59.720> off<00:03:59.959> the<00:03:59.989> gas<00:04:00.290> and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
going sideways ease off the gas and

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.370
