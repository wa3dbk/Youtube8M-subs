inch<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.329> dignity<00:01:33.780> away<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.380> rusev<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> just

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
inch of dignity away from rusev it just

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
inch of dignity away from rusev it just
seems<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.759> over<00:01:36.630> excessive<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
seems like it's over excessive and a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
seems like it's over excessive and a
little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:37.770> too<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.880> once<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
little bit too much I think that once it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.149 
little bit too much I think that once it
all<00:01:39.299> comes<00:01:39.600> down<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.439> think<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
all comes down to it i think that the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
all comes down to it i think that the
match<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.909> probably<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.659> good<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
match will probably be good because you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.660 
match will probably be good because you
