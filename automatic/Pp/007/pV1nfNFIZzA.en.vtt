versatile<00:00:27.939> functionality<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:29.349> know<00:00:29.439> I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
versatile functionality I you know I

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
versatile functionality I you know I
kind<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.710> think<00:00:29.830> that<00:00:29.950> depending<00:00:30.279> on<00:00:30.279> how<00:00:30.430> you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
kind of think that depending on how you

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.769 
kind of think that depending on how you
have<00:00:30.700> this<00:00:30.790> set<00:00:31.000> up<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.239> could<00:00:31.390> use<00:00:31.540> it<00:00:31.570> a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
have this set up you could use it a

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.950 
have this set up you could use it a
number<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.169> ways<00:00:32.320> whether<00:00:33.190> that's<00:00:33.489> as<00:00:33.960> again

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
number of ways whether that's as again

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.180 
number of ways whether that's as again
it's<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.140> clean<00:00:35.380> booster<00:00:35.710> kind<00:00:35.950> of<00:00:36.010> like<00:00:36.100> the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
it's a clean booster kind of like the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's a clean booster kind of like the
graviton<00:00:36.670> but<00:00:36.910> with<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.059> little<00:00:37.149> more<00:00:37.329> range

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
graviton but with a little more range

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.410 
graviton but with a little more range
all<00:00:39.399> right<00:00:39.489> it's<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.700> little<00:00:39.880> less<00:00:40.000> range<00:00:40.270> as<00:00:40.390> a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
all right it's a little less range as a

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.000 
all right it's a little less range as a
boost<00:00:40.660> but<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:40.960> little<00:00:41.260> more<00:00:41.350> range<00:00:41.559> for<00:00:41.800> other

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
boost but a little more range for other

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.580 
boost but a little more range for other
stuff<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.719> could<00:00:44.170> take<00:00:44.290> it<00:00:44.440> in<00:00:44.530> the

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
stuff or you could take it in the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.560 
stuff or you could take it in the
direction<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.950> an<00:00:45.040> overdrive<00:00:45.460> or<00:00:45.790> if<00:00:46.480> you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
direction of an overdrive or if you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.150 
direction of an overdrive or if you
really<00:00:46.839> max<00:00:47.079> things<00:00:47.379> out<00:00:47.589> you<00:00:47.620> almost<00:00:47.980> get

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
really max things out you almost get

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.919 
really max things out you almost get
like<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.339> fuzz<00:00:48.670> pedal<00:00:49.000> type<00:00:49.179> characteristic<00:00:49.809> to

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
like a fuzz pedal type characteristic to

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.130 
like a fuzz pedal type characteristic to
it<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.629> know<00:00:52.690> we're<00:00:52.780> going<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:52.960> take<00:00:53.019> this

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
it so you know we're going to take this

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.959 
it so you know we're going to take this
demo<00:00:53.440> here<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:53.859> kind<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.129> walk<00:00:54.670> through<00:00:54.730> a

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
demo here to kind of walk through a

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.049 
demo here to kind of walk through a
couple<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.300> different<00:00:55.600> things<00:00:56.230> Justin<00:00:56.559> can<00:00:56.679> do

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
couple of different things Justin can do

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.139 
couple of different things Justin can do
so<00:00:58.059> right<00:00:58.089> off<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.539> bat<00:00:58.629> I'm<00:00:59.260> using<00:00:59.609> an<00:01:00.609> LS<00:01:00.940> l

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
so right off the bat I'm using an LS l

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.689

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.120 
off the bat let's get started on the
flat<00:02:03.220> setting<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:05.200> kind<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.620> go<00:02:05.890> through

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
flat setting and just kind of go through

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.199 
flat setting and just kind of go through
some<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.400> boosting<00:02:06.730> here<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:08.879> again<00:02:09.879> like

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
some of the boosting here so again like

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.910 
some of the boosting here so again like
the<00:02:10.360> graviton<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> gain<00:02:11.319> knob<00:02:11.349> is<00:02:11.709> all<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
the graviton if the gain knob is all the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.539 
the graviton if the gain knob is all the
way<00:02:12.040> down<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.610> have<00:02:12.730> actually<00:02:13.150> no<00:02:13.330> similar<00:02:13.720> as

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
way down you have actually no similar as

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.149 
way down you have actually no similar as
so<00:02:16.549> gain<00:02:17.000> knob<00:02:17.150> all<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.360> way<00:02:17.420> down<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:18.159> don't

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
so gain knob all the way down I don't

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.849 
so gain knob all the way down I don't
wan<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:20.510> gone<00:02:20.689> I<00:02:20.930> don't<00:02:21.469> know<00:02:21.590> half<00:02:21.739> and

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
wan it's gone I don't know half and

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.390 
wan it's gone I don't know half and
there<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.040> go<00:02:23.799> so<00:02:24.799> now<00:02:24.829> we're<00:02:25.069> going<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.219> turn

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
there we go so now we're going to turn

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.009 
there we go so now we're going to turn
the<00:02:25.519> pedal<00:02:25.760> back<00:02:25.909> on<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.359> start<00:02:26.569> bringing<00:02:26.780> up

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
the pedal back on and start bringing up

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.979 
the pedal back on and start bringing up
the<00:02:27.140> game<00:02:27.319> just<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.159> sort<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:28.939> to<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.659> know<00:02:29.780> get

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the game just to sort of to you know get

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.199 
the game just to sort of to you know get
to<00:02:30.109> that<00:02:30.230> slightly<00:02:30.530> unity<00:02:30.950> section<00:02:31.549> boost

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
to that slightly unity section boost

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:44.039 
to that slightly unity section boost
area<00:02:41.409> so<00:02:42.409> that's<00:02:42.590> about<00:02:42.709> unity<00:02:43.129> right<00:02:43.310> there

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
area so that's about unity right there

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.440 
area so that's about unity right there
now<00:02:45.049> I'll<00:02:45.170> push<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.469> a<00:02:45.530> little<00:02:45.560> bit<00:02:45.799> hotter<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
now I'll push it a little bit hotter a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.539 
now I'll push it a little bit hotter a
little<00:02:47.450> bit<00:02:47.540> more<00:02:47.689> into<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.139> overdrive<00:02:49.010> sort

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
little bit more into the overdrive sort

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.610 
little bit more into the overdrive sort
of<00:02:49.639> characteristic<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.359> pedal<00:02:50.659> so<00:02:51.379> again

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
of characteristic of the pedal so again

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:00.490 
of characteristic of the pedal so again
here's<00:02:51.859> without<00:02:52.129> it

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.050 

now<00:03:01.500> we're<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.710> go<00:03:01.800> all<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.490> I<00:03:02.730> want<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
now we're to go all out here I want to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.020 
now we're to go all out here I want to
get<00:03:03.180> take<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.510> into<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.810> fuzz<00:03:04.080> land<00:03:05.030> well

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
get take this into like fuzz land well

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:22.860 
get take this into like fuzz land well
first<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.600> all<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:06.840> heavier<00:03:07.140> again

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.750 

Oh

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:48.320 

oh<00:03:29.900> yeah

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.820 

I'll<00:03:49.330> switch<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.810> voicing<00:03:50.200> switch<00:03:50.470> over<00:03:50.799> to

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
I'll switch the voicing switch over to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.920 
I'll switch the voicing switch over to
dark<00:03:51.190> which<00:03:51.909> should<00:03:52.150> complement<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:52.659> Telly's

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
dark which should complement the Telly's

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.690 
dark which should complement the Telly's
bridge<00:03:53.140> pick<00:03:53.349> up<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.560> little<00:03:53.769> bit<00:03:53.860> better<00:03:54.040> as

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
bridge pick up a little bit better as

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.460 
bridge pick up a little bit better as
it's<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.150> know<00:03:55.239> it'll<00:03:55.510> fill<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.170> some<00:03:56.319> of<00:03:56.379> the

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's you know it'll fill in some of the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.080 
it's you know it'll fill in some of the
lower<00:03:56.620> frequencies<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.099> little<00:03:57.250> bit<00:03:57.340> more<00:03:57.459> will

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
lower frequencies a little bit more will

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.610 
lower frequencies a little bit more will
still<00:03:58.299> leave<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.540> gain<00:03:58.810> knob<00:03:58.840> all<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.260> way<00:03:59.379> up

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
still leave the gain knob all the way up

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.440 
still leave the gain knob all the way up
here<00:03:59.650> just<00:04:00.250> kind<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.489> maxed<00:04:00.849> out<00:04:00.970> we're<00:04:01.239> still

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
here just kind of maxed out we're still

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.449 
here just kind of maxed out we're still
not<00:04:01.569> hairy<00:04:01.810> fuzz<00:04:02.079> land<00:04:02.379> this<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.190> great<00:04:03.430> for

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
not hairy fuzz land this is great for

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.520 
not hairy fuzz land this is great for
that<00:04:03.640> sort<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.239> know<00:04:04.269> Black<00:04:04.870> Keys<00:04:05.110> kind<00:04:05.440> of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
that sort of you know Black Keys kind of

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:23.700 
that sort of you know Black Keys kind of
dan<00:04:05.709> auerbach<00:04:06.040> tone<00:04:06.870> here<00:04:07.870> we<00:04:07.930> go

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.740 

I<00:04:23.949> want<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.789> back<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.120> off<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.360> little<00:04:25.600> bit

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
I want to back this off a little bit

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.110 
I want to back this off a little bit
here<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.370> go<00:04:27.370> back<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.669> just<00:04:27.699> sort<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.030> a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
here and go back to just sort of a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.719 
here and go back to just sort of a
regular<00:04:28.449> overdrive<00:04:28.930> actually<00:04:29.650> we're<00:04:30.490> worried

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
regular overdrive actually we're worried

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.189 
regular overdrive actually we're worried
about<00:04:30.789> two<00:04:31.120> o'clock<00:04:31.330> on<00:04:31.569> the<00:04:31.600> game<00:04:31.780> now<00:04:31.930> so

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
about two o'clock on the game now so

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:45.010 
about two o'clock on the game now so
we're<00:04:32.349> still<00:04:32.560> driving<00:04:33.550> pretty<00:04:33.880> hard

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.180 

as<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.199> see<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> lot<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.800> sonic

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
as you can see a lot of the sonic

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.770 
as you can see a lot of the sonic
characteristic<00:04:47.850> is<00:04:47.940> still<00:04:48.180> there<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.540> pedal

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
characteristic is still there the pedal

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.689 
characteristic is still there the pedal
sounds<00:04:49.139> you<00:04:49.889> know<00:04:50.010> it's<00:04:50.130> still<00:04:50.280> got<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.550> same

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
sounds you know it's still got the same

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.760 
sounds you know it's still got the same
unique<00:04:50.970> voice<00:04:51.180> but<00:04:51.660> it's<00:04:52.260> just<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.500> little<00:04:52.620> bit

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
unique voice but it's just a little bit

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.620 
unique voice but it's just a little bit
less<00:04:52.949> not<00:04:53.280> quite<00:04:53.520> as<00:04:53.699> not<00:04:54.060> quite<00:04:54.300> as<00:04:54.419> gainey
