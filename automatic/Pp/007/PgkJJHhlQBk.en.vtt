the<00:01:27.829> next<00:01:28.609> portion<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.359> just<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.079> numb<00:01:30.259> the

the next portion is just to numb the
whole<00:01:30.710> area<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.939> trick<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.539> I'm<00:01:32.750> using<00:01:33.049> a

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
whole area the trick is I'm using a

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.459 
whole area the trick is I'm using a
special<00:01:34.009> machine<00:01:34.189> that<00:01:34.729> gently<00:01:35.479> injects<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
special machine that gently injects the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.779 
special machine that gently injects the
anomic<00:01:37.039> fluid<00:01:37.429> underneath<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.270> skin<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.789> for

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
anomic fluid underneath the skin and for

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.959 
anomic fluid underneath the skin and for
that<00:01:40.939> reason<00:01:41.000> it's<00:01:41.719> not<00:01:41.869> as<00:01:42.759> discomforting<00:01:43.759> as

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
that reason it's not as discomforting as

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.090 
that reason it's not as discomforting as
a<00:01:44.000> needle<00:01:44.479> itself<00:01:44.869> because<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.500> fluid<00:01:45.829> is<00:01:46.039> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
a needle itself because the fluid is the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.609 
a needle itself because the fluid is the
one<00:01:46.399> actually<00:01:46.789> opening<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.840> tissue<00:01:48.110> and

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
one actually opening the tissue and

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.749 
one actually opening the tissue and
letting<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.780> area<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.409> get<00:01:51.590> numb<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
letting the area to get numb to this

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.910 
letting the area to get numb to this
relaxing<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:53.600> they're<00:01:53.929> enjoying<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.770> music

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
relaxing like they're enjoying the music

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.179 
relaxing like they're enjoying the music
and<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:57.969> agree<00:01:58.969> that<00:01:59.000> anesthesia<00:01:59.810> is<00:02:00.189> safe

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
and I agree that anesthesia is safe

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.729 
and I agree that anesthesia is safe
these<00:02:01.520> days<00:02:01.579> but<00:02:02.239> there<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:03.140> some<00:02:03.439> risk

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
these days but there is some risk

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.120 
these days but there is some risk
associated<00:02:04.130> with<00:02:04.579> anesthesia<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:06.439> way<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.649> see

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
associated with anesthesia the way I see

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.630 
associated with anesthesia the way I see
it<00:02:07.159> is<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.939> if<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.869> avoid<00:02:09.200> anesthesia<00:02:09.950> by

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
it is that if we can avoid anesthesia by

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.979 
it is that if we can avoid anesthesia by
any<00:02:10.910> mean<00:02:11.680> why<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.739> take<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.430> risk<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.780> this

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
any mean why to take that risk so this

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.500 
any mean why to take that risk so this
is<00:02:15.170> actually<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.610> mid<00:02:16.819> portion<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
