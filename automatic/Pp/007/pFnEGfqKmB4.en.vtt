00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
turn the valve okay what we're going to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.850 
turn the valve okay what we're going to
do<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> backwards<00:00:49.579> okay

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
do we're going to do it backwards okay

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
do we're going to do it backwards okay
we<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> put<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> valve<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:54.800> right<00:00:56.000> here<00:00:57.020> into

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
we can put the valve in right here into

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
we can put the valve in right here into
the<00:00:58.230> valve<00:00:58.500> guide<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the valve guide you can see that's the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.180 
the valve guide you can see that's the
valve<00:01:00.449> bad<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.920> need<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
valve bad right there if you need to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.149 
valve bad right there if you need to
replace<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> valve<00:01:03.030> guide<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:04.500> each<00:01:04.830> valve

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
replace the valve guide in each valve

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.780 
replace the valve guide in each valve
house<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.049> need<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> lightly<00:01:08.250> pound

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
house one but you need to lightly pound

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.100 
house one but you need to lightly pound
it<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.869> side<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> other<00:01:12.810> side

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it from this side out to the other side

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.310 
it from this side out to the other side
and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.590> put<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> exact<00:01:14.640> same<00:01:14.850> way

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
and then put it in the exact same way

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.520 
and then put it in the exact same way
now<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.460> what<00:01:17.460> we're<00:01:17.640> doing<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.320> I'm<00:01:19.320> gonna

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
now the what we're doing here I'm gonna

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
now the what we're doing here I'm gonna
see<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.920> use<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.509> magnifying<00:01:21.509> glass<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
see if I can use a magnifying glass it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.550 
see if I can use a magnifying glass it
might<00:01:22.380> work<00:01:22.590> might<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.560> refraction

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
might work might not what the refraction

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.670 
might work might not what the refraction
it's<00:01:25.740> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> cool<00:01:26.159> isn't<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.630> valve<00:01:28.140> has<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
it's kind of cool isn't the valve has a

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.450 
it's kind of cool isn't the valve has a
solid<00:01:31.680> metal<00:01:31.920> ring<00:01:32.909> around<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.280> that's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
solid metal ring around it and that's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
solid metal ring around it and that's
called<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.790> seat<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.600> put<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:36.990> there

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
called a seat and that's put in there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.490 
called a seat and that's put in there
when<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.780> valve<00:01:39.780> seat<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> ring<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:42.500> heated

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
when the valve seat or a ring is heated

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.639 
when the valve seat or a ring is heated
up<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:44.780> cooled<00:01:45.780> excuse<00:01:46.320> me<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:47.040> cooled<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
up or cooled excuse me it's cooled and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.679 
up or cooled excuse me it's cooled and
then<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.579> outside<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.759> head<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.149> heated

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
then the outside of the head is heated

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.789 
then the outside of the head is heated
up<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> outside<00:01:56.189> expands<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.570> inside<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
up so the outside expands the inside of

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.880 
up so the outside expands the inside of
the<00:01:58.920> ring<00:01:59.509> contracts<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.899> drops<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the ring contracts it drops in there and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.240 
the ring contracts it drops in there and
then<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.689> expands<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.869> sticks<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
then it expands and sticks and there is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.539 
then it expands and sticks and there is
there's<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.479> in

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
there's one here in

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.809 
there's one here in
intake<00:02:08.679> which<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.860> right<00:02:10.039> here<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.280> larger<00:02:10.640> one

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
intake which is right here is larger one

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.780 
intake which is right here is larger one
and<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.150> exhaust<00:02:11.860> now<00:02:12.860> I'm<00:02:13.099> looking<00:02:13.430> over<00:02:13.519> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and the exhaust now I'm looking over the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.949 
and the exhaust now I'm looking over the
valve<00:02:14.000> seats<00:02:15.489> they<00:02:16.489> have<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.849> seal<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.480> they

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
valve seats they have to seal and they

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.180 
valve seats they have to seal and they
have<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.200> seal<00:02:18.440> airtight<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:21.190> that's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
have to seal airtight and that's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.729 
have to seal airtight and that's
basically<00:02:22.580> all<00:02:22.790> we're<00:02:22.940> doing<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.599> on<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
basically all we're doing is on the

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.670 
basically all we're doing is on the
compression<00:02:25.569> combustion<00:02:26.569> stroke<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
compression combustion stroke of the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.970 
compression combustion stroke of the
piston<00:02:28.060> when<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.239> comes<00:02:29.599> up<00:02:30.819> both<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.510> exhaust

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.780 

and<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.580> intake<00:02:38.060> valve<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:40.280> got<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.700> be

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and the intake valve have got to be

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.319 
and the intake valve have got to be
sealed<00:02:41.090> tight<00:02:41.420> for<00:02:41.870> maximum<00:02:42.500> performance<00:02:43.329> not

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
sealed tight for maximum performance not

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.900 
sealed tight for maximum performance not
really<00:02:45.190> there's<00:02:46.190> not<00:02:46.370> really<00:02:46.579> that<00:02:46.670> much

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
really there's not really that much

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.759 
really there's not really that much
performance<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.840> these<00:02:47.930> little<00:02:48.140> motors<00:02:48.380> it

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
performance in these little motors it

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.280 
performance in these little motors it
wouldn't<00:02:49.069> be<00:02:49.190> called<00:02:49.930> performance<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
wouldn't be called performance what it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.050 
wouldn't be called performance what it
would<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.500> called<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:52.069> maximum<00:02:53.319> efficiency<00:02:55.060> so

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
would be called is maximum efficiency so

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.660 
would be called is maximum efficiency so
if<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.989> get<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.410> there<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:58.519> we're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
if I can get that in there now we're

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.339 
if I can get that in there now we're
going<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.849> check<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.239> valve<00:02:59.450> guides<00:02:59.750> the

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
going to check the valve guides the

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.229 
going to check the valve guides the
valve<00:03:00.590> guides<00:03:02.019> are<00:03:03.019> circular<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.010> hollow<00:03:04.790> and

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
valve guides are circular and hollow and

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.229 
valve guides are circular and hollow and
the<00:03:06.170> valves<00:03:06.470> run<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.010> down<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.310> them<00:03:07.459> what

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the valves run up and down in them what

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.160 
the valves run up and down in them what
we<00:03:08.360> want<00:03:08.569> to<00:03:08.629> look<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.200> excessive<00:03:09.920> play<00:03:11.170> so

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
we want to look for is excessive play so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.470 
we want to look for is excessive play so
we<00:03:12.290> turn<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.650> turn<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.100> over<00:03:13.370> again<00:03:13.489> play

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
we turn it turn this over again play

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.640 
we turn it turn this over again play
would<00:03:14.810> be<00:03:15.019> where<00:03:15.579> we<00:03:16.579> have<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:18.290> end<00:03:18.500> of

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
would be where we have the the end of

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.190 
would be where we have the the end of
the<00:03:18.709> valve<00:03:18.920> here<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.600> we<00:03:20.600> want<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.930> move<00:03:21.049> it

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
the valve here and we want to move it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.949 
the valve here and we want to move it
around<00:03:21.639> well<00:03:22.639> one<00:03:22.850> doesn't<00:03:23.180> move<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.690> side<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
around well one doesn't move it side to

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.590 
around well one doesn't move it side to
side<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.950> see<00:03:25.280> if<00:03:25.400> there's<00:03:25.639> any<00:03:25.880> excessive

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
and with these little motors remembered

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.539 
and with these little motors remembered
it's<00:04:02.389> basically<00:04:02.750> these<00:04:03.680> little<00:04:04.069> Honda<00:04:04.310> 50

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
it's basically these little Honda 50

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.289 
it's basically these little Honda 50
motors<00:04:05.000> are<00:04:05.150> in<00:04:05.319> most<00:04:06.319> weed<00:04:06.620> whackers<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:08.180> it's

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
motors are in most weed whackers so it's

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.309 
motors are in most weed whackers so it's
not<00:04:08.480> really<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:08.840> it's<00:04:09.230> some<00:04:10.900> 50<00:04:11.900> thousand

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
not really like it's some 50 thousand

not really like it's some 50 thousand
horsepower<00:04:15.400> tugboat<00:04:16.400> motor

with<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.239> exhaust<00:04:18.479> valve<00:04:18.840> it'll<00:04:19.169> be<00:04:19.259> a<00:04:19.289> little

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
with the exhaust valve it'll be a little

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.979 
with the exhaust valve it'll be a little
different<00:04:19.769> because<00:04:20.129> I<00:04:20.340> have<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.539> clean<00:04:21.780> out

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
different because I have to clean out

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.429 
different because I have to clean out
this<00:04:22.379> port<00:04:23.069> right<00:04:23.430> here

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:24.439 
this port right here

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.390 
this port right here
I'll<00:04:25.439> see<00:04:25.590> if<00:04:25.710> that'll<00:04:25.919> work<00:04:25.949> a<00:04:26.129> little<00:04:26.189> bit

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
I'll see if that'll work a little bit

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.129 
I'll see if that'll work a little bit
better<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.909> don't<00:04:27.300> know<00:04:27.419> I've<00:04:27.719> used<00:04:27.750> a

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
better I don't know I've used a

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.760 
better I don't know I've used a
microphone<00:04:28.939> a<00:04:29.990> glass<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.259> that<00:04:31.439> so<00:04:31.650> we're

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
microphone a glass like that so we're

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.959 
microphone a glass like that so we're
gonna<00:04:31.889> see<00:04:32.039> if<00:04:32.099> that<00:04:32.219> will<00:04:32.310> work<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.669> may<00:04:32.789> not

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:32.969 
gonna see if that will work it may not

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.600 
gonna see if that will work it may not
work<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.419> may<00:04:33.539> refract<00:04:34.139> off<00:04:34.409> the<00:04:34.650> lens<00:04:35.069> and<00:04:35.490> not

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
work it may refract off the lens and not

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.429 
work it may refract off the lens and not
work<00:04:35.849> but<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.449> have<00:04:36.569> to<00:04:36.780> clean<00:04:36.960> up<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.229> whole

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:37.439 
work but I have to clean up this whole

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:42.260 
work but I have to clean up this whole
port<00:04:37.860> right<00:04:38.159> down<00:04:38.370> into<00:04:38.610> here<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:41.060> what<00:04:42.060> we're

taking<00:05:14.940> both<00:05:15.569> hands<00:05:15.930> like<00:05:16.169> this<00:05:16.379> guy<00:05:16.529> has<00:05:16.889> and

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
taking both hands like this guy has and

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.450 
taking both hands like this guy has and
he's<00:05:18.539> got<00:05:18.750> a<00:05:18.779> wooden<00:05:19.080> dowel<00:05:19.469> and<00:05:19.830> he's<00:05:19.949> rubbing

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
he's got a wooden dowel and he's rubbing

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.010 
he's got a wooden dowel and he's rubbing
them<00:05:21.620> he's<00:05:22.620> basically<00:05:23.039> grinding<00:05:23.819> the<00:05:24.690> valve

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
them he's basically grinding the valve

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.490 
them he's basically grinding the valve
into<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:26.460> valve<00:05:26.699> seat<00:05:27.199> well<00:05:28.199> we're<00:05:28.349> going<00:05:28.440> to

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
into the valve seat well we're going to

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.200 
into the valve seat well we're going to
take<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.800> nice<00:05:29.009> and<00:05:29.069> slow<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.729> know<00:05:29.789> it's

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
take this nice and slow and I know it's

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.559 
take this nice and slow and I know it's
it's<00:05:33.210> 2:30<00:05:33.599> in<00:05:33.659> the<00:05:33.750> morning<00:05:33.810> I<00:05:34.229> know<00:05:34.289> I'm<00:05:34.529> slow

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
it's 2:30 in the morning I know I'm slow

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.170 
it's 2:30 in the morning I know I'm slow
but<00:05:36.569> I<00:05:36.599> think<00:05:37.310> people<00:05:38.310> would<00:05:38.729> really

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
but I think people would really

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.760 
but I think people would really
appreciate<00:05:39.509> me<00:05:39.930> going<00:05:40.199> slower<00:05:40.560> and

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
appreciate me going slower and

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.399 
appreciate me going slower and
explaining<00:05:41.370> more<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:42.690> could<00:05:42.839> only<00:05:42.960> speed<00:05:43.259> it

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
explaining more you could only speed it

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.439 
explaining more you could only speed it
up<00:05:43.560> rather<00:05:43.919> than<00:05:44.069> go<00:05:44.339> very<00:05:44.699> quickly<00:05:45.029> and<00:05:45.330> you

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
up rather than go very quickly and you

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.269 
up rather than go very quickly and you
say<00:05:45.690> wait<00:05:45.870> what's<00:05:46.379> this<00:05:46.529> for<00:05:46.770> we<00:05:46.919> meant<00:05:47.159> what

tired I'm going to bed but I will take

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.430 
tired I'm going to bed but I will take
one<00:06:21.000> of<00:06:21.120> these<00:06:21.210> valves

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
one of these valves

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.120 
one of these valves
let's<00:06:23.280> start<00:06:23.550> with<00:06:23.700> that<00:06:27.800> see<00:06:28.800> if<00:06:28.890> I<00:06:28.950> can<00:06:29.040> get

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
let's start with that see if I can get

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.980 
let's start with that see if I can get
him<00:06:29.220> out<00:06:29.340> here<00:06:31.340> we<00:06:32.340> push<00:06:32.580> one<00:06:32.790> out<00:06:32.840> let's<00:06:33.840> see

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
him out here we push one out let's see

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.150 
him out here we push one out let's see
how<00:06:34.110> well<00:06:34.320> it'll<00:06:34.500> come<00:06:34.620> out<00:06:34.950> on<00:06:35.220> that<00:06:36.560> of<00:06:37.560> the

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
how well it'll come out on that of the

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.120 
how well it'll come out on that of the
guide<00:06:39.950> and<00:06:40.950> I've<00:06:41.130> looked<00:06:41.430> at<00:06:41.670> this<00:06:42.830> valve<00:06:43.830> seat

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
guide and I've looked at this valve seat

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.680 
guide and I've looked at this valve seat
and<00:06:44.340> it<00:06:44.610> looks<00:06:44.850> pretty<00:06:45.120> clean<00:06:45.360> all<00:06:45.510> the<00:06:45.600> way

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
and it looks pretty clean all the way

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.120 
and it looks pretty clean all the way
around<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:48.120> that<00:06:48.570> Valve<00:06:48.930> seek<00:06:49.260> is<00:06:49.470> cut<00:06:49.800> at<00:06:50.040> a

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
around and that Valve seek is cut at a

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.910 
around and that Valve seek is cut at a
certain<00:06:51.440> angle<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:53.010> I<00:06:53.280> don't<00:06:53.340> know<00:06:53.610> what<00:06:53.850> the

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
certain angle and I don't know what the

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.440 
certain angle and I don't know what the
what<00:06:55.920> the<00:06:55.950> angle<00:06:56.310> is<00:06:56.400> but<00:06:56.760> that<00:06:56.940> is<00:06:57.090> cut<00:06:57.300> at<00:06:57.420> a

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
what the angle is but that is cut at a

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:04.510 
what the angle is but that is cut at a
certain<00:06:57.780> angle<00:06:58.050> and<00:06:59.660> this<00:07:00.660> valve<00:07:00.960> right<00:07:03.020> here

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
certain angle and this valve right here

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.440 
certain angle and this valve right here
is<00:07:05.520> cut<00:07:05.910> at<00:07:06.180> a<00:07:06.210> certain<00:07:06.570> angle<00:07:06.920> and<00:07:08.240> what<00:07:09.240> all

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
is cut at a certain angle and what all

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.890 
is cut at a certain angle and what all
we<00:07:09.750> want<00:07:09.960> to<00:07:10.050> do<00:07:10.200> basically<00:07:10.860> is<00:07:11.430> to<00:07:12.390> take<00:07:12.600> some

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
we want to do basically is to take some

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.170 
we want to do basically is to take some
of<00:07:13.020> this<00:07:13.110> compound<00:07:13.710> right<00:07:13.890> here<00:07:14.130> we'll<00:07:14.910> start

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
of this compound right here we'll start

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.900 
of this compound right here we'll start
with<00:07:15.420> the<00:07:16.460> the<00:07:17.460> course<00:07:18.380> grade<00:07:19.550> and<00:07:20.550> it's<00:07:20.760> got

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
with the the course grade and it's got

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.470 
with the the course grade and it's got
grease<00:07:21.180> in<00:07:21.210> it<00:07:21.540> grease<00:07:22.200> and<00:07:22.530> silicon<00:07:23.160> carbide

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.480 
grease in it grease and silicon carbide

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.400 
grease in it grease and silicon carbide
the<00:07:24.480> grease<00:07:24.780> is<00:07:25.650> used<00:07:26.040> to<00:07:26.960> follow<00:07:27.960> that<00:07:30.410> cut

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
the grease is used to follow that cut

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.520 
the grease is used to follow that cut
enzymes<00:07:32.010> I<00:07:32.160> cut<00:07:32.430> it<00:07:32.780> know<00:07:33.780> it's<00:07:33.960> leaking<00:07:34.410> I

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.530 
enzymes I cut it know it's leaking I

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.190 
enzymes I cut it know it's leaking I
think<00:07:35.960> the<00:07:36.960> grease<00:07:37.880> basically<00:07:38.880> lets<00:07:39.810> the

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200 
think the grease basically lets the

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.510 
think the grease basically lets the
compound<00:07:41.040> stay<00:07:41.340> in<00:07:41.490> this<00:07:41.580> one<00:07:41.790> area

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.650 

I'm<00:07:48.520> gonna<00:07:48.640> put<00:07:48.850> a<00:07:48.880> little<00:07:49.060> bit<00:07:49.240> on<00:07:49.300> the<00:07:49.510> end

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:49.660 
I'm gonna put a little bit on the end

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.990 
I'm gonna put a little bit on the end
here<00:07:49.960> right<00:07:50.680> here<00:07:51.570> and<00:07:52.570> then<00:07:52.900> I<00:07:53.020> have<00:07:53.050> another

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 
here right here and then I have another

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.630 
here right here and then I have another
little<00:07:55.000> trick<00:07:55.390> that<00:07:55.630> I<00:07:55.690> want<00:07:55.900> to<00:07:55.960> show<00:07:56.110> you

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:56.640 
little trick that I want to show you

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:04.470 
little trick that I want to show you
Jesus<00:07:57.720> 7:58<00:07:58.720> and<00:07:59.460> must<00:08:00.460> be<00:08:01.170> next<00:08:02.170> video
