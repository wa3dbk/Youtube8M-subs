a lot of biologists explicitly

a lot of biologists explicitly
frightened<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.370> mathematics<00:00:53.880> and<00:00:54.030> that's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
frightened of mathematics and that's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
frightened of mathematics and that's
something<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.899> work<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.410> round

but<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.460> increasing<00:00:56.730> number<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.510> the

but I think an increasing number see the

but I think an increasing number see the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that increasingly biologists are

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.960 
that increasingly biologists are

tease out extra meaning we actually

way

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.899 

right<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:41.930> day<00:01:42.259> one<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:43.250> literally<00:01:43.700> just

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
right so on day one we literally just

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.700 
right so on day one we literally just
sat<00:01:44.119> there<00:01:44.420> pulling<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.929> hair<00:01:45.109> out<00:01:45.289> trying<00:01:45.530> to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
sat there pulling a hair out trying to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.700 
sat there pulling a hair out trying to
work<00:01:45.979> out<00:01:46.310> exactly<00:01:47.060> what<00:01:47.689> was<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:48.109> on<00:01:48.229> often

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
work out exactly what was going on often

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.649 
work out exactly what was going on often
it<00:01:49.310> depends<00:01:49.850> very<00:01:49.969> strongly<00:01:50.420> on<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
it depends very strongly on the

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.600 
it depends very strongly on the
personalities<00:01:51.289> involved<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:51.920> sometimes<00:01:52.399> it

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
personalities involved so sometimes it

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.190 
personalities involved so sometimes it
can<00:01:52.759> be<00:01:52.789> quite<00:01:53.030> strong<00:01:53.299> arguments<00:01:53.869> about<00:01:53.960> what

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
can be quite strong arguments about what

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200 
can be quite strong arguments about what
should<00:01:54.439> go<00:01:54.590> in<00:01:54.740> models<00:01:55.069> sometimes<00:01:55.880> people

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
should go in models sometimes people

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.120 
should go in models sometimes people

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
just start being away straight away and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.130 
just start being away straight away and
doing<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.460> details

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.800 

they<00:02:05.710> asked<00:02:06.130> some<00:02:06.370> some<00:02:06.790> very<00:02:06.970> incisive

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
they asked some some very incisive

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.430 
they asked some some very incisive
questions<00:02:09.149> which<00:02:10.149> certainly<00:02:10.509> made<00:02:10.720> me<00:02:11.050> think

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
questions which certainly made me think

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.150 
questions which certainly made me think
and<00:02:11.709> go<00:02:12.640> away<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.120> look<00:02:13.360> things<00:02:13.630> up<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:15.069> all

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and go away and look things up as we all

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.400 
and go away and look things up as we all

ah<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.780> stuff<00:02:35.050> on<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.319> whiteboard

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.410 
ah so that the stuff on the whiteboard
is<00:02:36.220> essentially<00:02:36.880> coming<00:02:37.000> out<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.360> the

is essentially coming out of the
discussion<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.110> people<00:02:38.500> toss<00:02:38.709> ideas<00:02:39.130> back<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
discussion so people toss ideas back and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.979

and agreed typically you go away and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.390 
and agreed typically you go away and

simulations<00:02:49.060> here<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.540> people<00:02:49.810> are

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
simulations here so it's people are

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.410 
simulations here so it's people are
doing<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.350> laptops<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:52.090> actually

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
doing on laptops and so on it's actually

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.729 
doing on laptops and so on it's actually
really<00:02:52.810> fun<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.170> it's<00:02:53.290> quite<00:02:53.470> different

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
really fun and it's quite different

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.860 
really fun and it's quite different
because<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.820> know<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.180> my<00:02:55.360> day-to-day<00:02:55.540> work

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
because you know in my day-to-day work

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.820 
because you know in my day-to-day work
I'm<00:02:56.470> working<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:57.130> my<00:02:57.370> own<00:02:57.580> on<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.600> desk<00:02:58.959> with

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
I'm working on my own on a desk with

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.070 
I'm working on my own on a desk with
just<00:03:00.100> my<00:03:00.250> brain<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.850> now<00:03:01.209> it's<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:01.720> lots<00:03:01.989> of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
just my brain and now it's like lots of

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.110 
just my brain and now it's like lots of
brains<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.950> same<00:03:03.160> problem<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.880> keep

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
brains on the same problem and I keep

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.350 
brains on the same problem and I keep
talking<00:03:04.360> about<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.820> alright<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:06.880> now<00:03:07.209> we're

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
talking about it alright so now we're

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.509 
talking about it alright so now we're
off<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> conference<00:03:08.290> dinner<00:03:08.560> one<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
off for the conference dinner one of the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.819 
off for the conference dinner one of the
fun<00:03:09.730> parts<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.570> study<00:03:10.810> group<00:03:11.079> so<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:11.680> have

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
fun parts of the study group so we have

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.830 
fun parts of the study group so we have
a<00:03:11.860> bit<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.400> drinks<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.180> first<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.690> then

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
a bit of a drinks at first and then

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.250 
a bit of a drinks at first and then
hopefully<00:03:14.110> during<00:03:14.680> dinner<00:03:14.890> people<00:03:15.310> will

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
hopefully during dinner people will

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:55.910 
hopefully during dinner people will
socialise<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.920> know<00:03:18.209> start<00:03:19.209> networking

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.290 

well<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.070> was<00:03:57.250> wonderful

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
well it was wonderful

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.140 
well it was wonderful
we<00:03:58.690> had<00:03:59.220> back-and-forth<00:04:00.220> discussions

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
we had back-and-forth discussions

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.730 
we had back-and-forth discussions
between<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:02.460> biologists<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
between the biologists and the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.220 
between the biologists and the
mathematicians<00:04:06.420> we<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.630> moved<00:04:07.870> much

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
mathematicians we just moved much

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.380 
mathematicians we just moved much
quicker<00:04:08.500> than<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.460> thought<00:04:09.640> probably<00:04:10.210> because

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
quicker than I thought probably because

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.450 
quicker than I thought probably because
I<00:04:10.420> wasn't<00:04:10.720> here<00:04:10.990> for<00:04:11.050> two<00:04:11.350> or<00:04:11.380> three<00:04:11.620> days<00:04:11.800> that

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
I wasn't here for two or three days that

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.420 
I wasn't here for two or three days that
didn't<00:04:12.820> slow<00:04:12.910> people<00:04:13.210> up<00:04:13.480> there<00:04:14.200> was<00:04:14.440> yeah

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
didn't slow people up there was yeah

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.530 
didn't slow people up there was yeah
but<00:04:15.730> with<00:04:15.850> some<00:04:16.000> company<00:04:16.299> with<00:04:16.420> some

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
but with some company with some

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.150 
but with some company with some
genuinely<00:04:17.019> difficult<00:04:17.440> mathematics<00:04:17.920> in<00:04:18.040> there

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
genuinely difficult mathematics in there

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:33.800 
genuinely difficult mathematics in there
and<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.400> pleases<00:04:18.670> me<00:04:18.940> too

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.710 

and<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.860> might<00:04:35.070> end<00:04:35.100> up<00:04:35.460> five<00:04:35.790> pipes<00:04:36.210> which<00:04:36.570> is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
and it might end up five pipes which is

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:47.170 
and it might end up five pipes which is
quite<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.930> huge<00:04:37.320> following<00:04:38.070> over

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.140 

I<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.009> will<00:04:49.100> inform<00:04:49.580> future<00:04:49.940> decisions

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
I think it will inform future decisions

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.710 
I think it will inform future decisions
and<00:04:51.130> allow<00:04:52.130> us<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.460> develop<00:04:52.669> our<00:04:53.150> strengths

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
and allow us to develop our strengths

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.110 
and allow us to develop our strengths
and<00:04:53.840> strategies<00:04:54.020> thereafter<00:04:54.979> headway<00:04:55.850> was

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
and strategies thereafter headway was

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.939 
and strategies thereafter headway was
made<00:04:56.449> and<00:04:56.840> equally<00:04:57.440> importantly

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
made and equally importantly

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.320 
made and equally importantly
collaborations<00:04:58.699> have<00:04:58.789> started<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.240> be

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
collaborations have started to be

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.050 
collaborations have started to be
established<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.220> always<00:05:01.490> very<00:05:01.610> pleasing

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
established and is always very pleasing

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.200 
established and is always very pleasing
to<00:05:02.090> see<00:05:02.380> young<00:05:03.380> new<00:05:03.650> research<00:05:03.979> is<00:05:04.220> getting<00:05:04.370> so

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
to see young new research is getting so

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.770 
to see young new research is getting so
enthusiastically<00:05:05.930> involved<00:05:06.410> with<00:05:06.530> things
