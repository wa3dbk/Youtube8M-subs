that's the lid side and the black one
which<00:02:19.159> is<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.640> other<00:02:19.879> side<00:02:20.150> most<00:02:20.480> striking

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
which is on the other side most striking

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.949 
which is on the other side most striking
and<00:02:21.049> most<00:02:21.230> unusual<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.909> this<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:23.840> know

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
and most unusual to have this you know

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.039 
and most unusual to have this you know
very<00:02:24.260> very<00:02:24.379> richly<00:02:24.829> combined<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.900> think

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
very very richly combined and so I think

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.069 
very very richly combined and so I think
the<00:02:27.469> sensuous<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.370> beautiful<00:02:28.909> image<00:02:29.510> is

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
the sensuous and beautiful image is

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.280 
the sensuous and beautiful image is
really<00:02:30.469> extremely<00:02:31.370> well<00:02:32.180> suited<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.840> be<00:02:33.079> you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
really extremely well suited to be you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.519 
really extremely well suited to be you
know<00:02:33.379> at<00:02:33.469> the<00:02:33.590> heart<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.859> the<00:02:34.010> exhibition
