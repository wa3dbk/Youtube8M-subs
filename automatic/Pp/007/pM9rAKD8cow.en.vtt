00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
kind of just maintenance see the debuff

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.020 
kind of just maintenance see the debuff
wasn't<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.590> interesting<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.580> thought<00:03:14.820> let's

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
wasn't that interesting we thought let's

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.760 
wasn't that interesting we thought let's
just<00:03:15.270> get<00:03:15.360> rid<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.570> them<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.990> focus<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.530> tank

thunderclap and sunder and things like

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.250 
thunderclap and sunder and things like
that<00:03:20.070> so<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.390> not<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.840> demoralizing
