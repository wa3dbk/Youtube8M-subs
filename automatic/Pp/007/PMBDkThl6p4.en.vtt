for a long quite a while now I think

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
that the safety and infection control

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.930 
that the safety and infection control
are<00:01:03.229> our<00:01:03.920> big<00:01:04.220> ones<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.640> how<00:01:04.790> we<00:01:04.850> can

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
are our big ones and how we can

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.020 
are our big ones and how we can
integrate<00:01:05.180> those<00:01:06.080> measures<00:01:06.620> into<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.880> other

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
integrate those measures into the other

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.430 
integrate those measures into the other

evidence-based<00:01:48.130> selling<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.140> have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
evidence-based selling and so you have

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.260 
evidence-based selling and so you have

well<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:26.530> very<00:02:26.890> interesting<00:02:27.490> what<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.640> see

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
well it's very interesting what you see

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.000 
well it's very interesting what you see
now<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.960> role<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.560> hospital

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
now is that the role of the hospital

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.770 
now is that the role of the hospital
will<00:02:30.220> change<00:02:30.490> very<00:02:30.580> much<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.860> hospital<00:02:33.780> will

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
will change very much the hospital will

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.970 
will change very much the hospital will
only<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.100> core<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> health<00:02:37.060> care

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
only be the core of the health care

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.530 
only be the core of the health care
services<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:40.210> there<00:02:40.600> will<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:43.060> be

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
services but there will be really I be

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.720

sated<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.020> distribution<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.340> kind<00:02:45.640> of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
sated the distribution of all kind of

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.610 
sated the distribution of all kind of
health<00:02:45.910> care<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.240> much<00:02:46.510> more<00:02:46.990> embedded<00:02:47.350> in

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
health care so much more embedded in

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.980 
health care so much more embedded in
society<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.280> what<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.300> will<00:02:49.450> see<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
society so what you will see that the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.910 
society so what you will see that the
basin<00:02:50.410> journey<00:02:50.710> will<00:02:51.640> also<00:02:52.060> will<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:53.380> part<00:02:53.680> of

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
basin journey will also will be part of

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.760 
basin journey will also will be part of

the leader of that organization I think

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.540 
the leader of that organization I think
the<00:03:05.870> most<00:03:05.990> interesting<00:03:06.170> trend<00:03:06.800> for<00:03:07.010> us<00:03:07.130> we<00:03:07.430> are

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
the most interesting trend for us we are

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.740 
the most interesting trend for us we are
involved<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:07.910> wayfinding<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:11.390> use<00:03:11.720> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
involved in wayfinding is the use of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.780 
involved in wayfinding is the use of
handheld<00:03:12.350> devices<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:13.100> help<00:03:13.130> people<00:03:13.580> find

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
handheld devices to help people find

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.720 
handheld devices to help people find
their<00:03:14.030> way<00:03:14.210> through<00:03:14.950> private<00:03:15.950> institutions

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
their way through private institutions

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.220 
their way through private institutions
and<00:03:17.650> we're<00:03:18.650> doing<00:03:19.220> research<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.820> see<00:03:20.420> how<00:03:20.720> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
and we're doing research to see how to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.700 
and we're doing research to see how to
get<00:03:21.650> interior<00:03:22.550> spaces<00:03:23.020> mapped<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.260> Google

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
get interior spaces mapped and Google

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.190 
get interior spaces mapped and Google
and<00:03:25.010> mapquest
