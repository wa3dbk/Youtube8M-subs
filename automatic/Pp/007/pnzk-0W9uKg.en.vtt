00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 this episode is an offer by 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 games br 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.469
 galapagos games and have seen the light of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.469
 Brazil 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:25.350
 Hey, two finals over another month 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.150
 Do you think I love the universe? 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.279
 too fanciful times that I 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.859
 I'm not very much the people 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.770
 You can crucify me now, but I do not 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.040
 I'm a new guy, chrome, it's not a cesar. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 I even came from RPG for years and years a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.899
 rpg such I love fantasy universe but 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 I'd rather let this protect 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.100
 then you have something that I think 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.090
 positive of the mod game with drugs 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.670
 This game can work a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.870
 incredible RPG mentality within the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.520
 You may not even want to go to a table. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.280
 interpret but it is all the content 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 ranking the grace charm the game called is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 very famous and that our rich by this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 rpg narrative 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.670
 This is very cool and it's the question of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.320
 rules are very simple but there are lots of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.570
 thing to remind you of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 a skill of a mouse then you have 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.860
 who get a little turned on but not if a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 master is not and is ideal for playing 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 with children is not a children's game 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.939
 but you can play with kids maybe 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 a child alone can not help 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.020
 it 's not but you can see your son 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.270
 nephew for such a table they will 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.710
 have fun as much as this is a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.290
 dandy to the lap fmi nobody wins 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.070
 usually he is not so he is mere 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.600
 frame is né and joão mamede is that guy 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 that fancy little arranged me 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.090
 moral and ritchie given and such universe 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.310
 very closed inside there and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.110
 will all fancy the great grace that I 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.200
 I find this here speaking in terms of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.990
 temperature and fantasy is it has a content 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.390
 disney knows what's morality is one thing 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.700
 dgp gamma the medieval characters that already 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.630
 knows what reveals that the nerd knows 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.630
 I would not call another galley 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.930
 is a gift and mouse is a cat facing 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.510
 as inventing a sinister spider and gives 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.730
 fear is tense is very similar but the moon 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.140
 plays are decisive for you 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.660
 get a strategy in this game 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.920
 because the other legal thing is 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.630
 initiative changes some robots do not steal 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.100
 initiative or you will head in 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.580
 towel you can the first can be the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.560
 last 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.410
 if I were the first he had his second 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.660
 Great I could have saved you in the people 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.640
 so it's a thing that depends a lot on 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.490
 to go out with this and think that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.560
 if you get to the famous barbosa queen 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.320
 not only of style if you see the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.060
 shading unit cones depth 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.220
 with thumbnails or very good 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.200
 clowns in these stories in the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.190
 my beautiful imagines this current saga 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.800
 paint and the book itself 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.090
 just look at the rules say is not 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.670
 normal written 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.550
 since the annual rate is a norm it is bad 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.090
 is organized in practical terms 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.760
 it's not didactic so it's all a lot 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.220
 you will read a whole new one 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.440
 full of doubt for the end when 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.690
 You put the game on the table you go in the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.670
 first game you look at the people here and 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.200
 So you took the doubt you have to stay 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.480
 all the time looking for that sea soon 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 not too big but it does not have a 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.730
 play the oc that would help fantastic 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.100
 It is still much more agile. 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.870
 more china at the table and would avoid people 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.420
 repeats of making these mistakes that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.340
 people committed now I do not remember just missing 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.400
 it is a lack of attention sometimes in the boil 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.080
 exact in the adventure you forget the eu 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.760
 I have a physical power not case and such 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.770
 that creature kills the creature dry 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.840
 just know how you saw us 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.270
 He corrected two or three times and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.700
 likely to happen yes but because he 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.530
 is filming in April exactly 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.620
 Can you see the will if it's in plenary? 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.200
 He said that we have with the plaid. 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.930
 it works I like you appoint a 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.560
 error easier to view the error that 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.680
 thanks to this 89 house rule online 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.170
 but we will not go back until then I've heard 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.910
 here there is no latte 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.680
 I have to make sure the milk is a 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.810
 thing about translation 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.370
 I found the production very good for us 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.170
 like I said, we need to get 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.490
 accustom also already has a domain of 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.310
 English is thai tradition the block space 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.450
 these things are just to consume 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.620
 there are some typing errors of 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.830
 described in the manual in book one of 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.800
 history story there is an expulsion 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.420
 very little does not exist but exists 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.960
 so man wrote there he has a 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.000
 word taha of the mask not possible 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.520
 paying this time until when 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.430
 're reading this you will be - the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.370
 to interpret it all would do such 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.920
 as it did to show you're looking 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.140
 I think it's a game that's for sure. 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.510
 will be very successful both the guys 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.970
 of rpg a galera in burgueya school 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.880
 will still see blood is the expansion brings 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.850
 new adventures and such but the game it 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.130
 depends on the expansion maybe if you already 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.010
 played him several times and if he comes back 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.710
 sometimes already paid was worth it with 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.990
 sure only with the basics will play is not 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.360
 that game that will make the bull count 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.960
 on the table how much I spent for how many 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.030
 times saw me play your adventure several 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.770
 times this episode is not because I know 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.110
 that every time he was a prey he goes 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.660
 be as fun as it is the last one has 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.890
 games that are beach and have games 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.390
 what are a movie 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.220
 This one is like a movie, you? 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:56.520

00:05:47.220 --> 00:06:01.710
