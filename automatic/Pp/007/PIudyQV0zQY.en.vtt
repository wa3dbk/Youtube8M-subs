00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.050
 yes I have to honestly admit that I am 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.250
 It took a long time for something to happen 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.019
 Find what I bring out today 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.750
 needs everything in the extremely long time 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.160
 but after a long pondering I have that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 found what we can show today and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 Although I want you a bit about it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.460
 with each well in the time where today 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.989
 small change was on the way and one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 tasting has believed that was one 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 great time because it was so 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.329
 some things that make me believe it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.160
 let the system really exist 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.329
 I'll tell you another one right away 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 a little further than I remember 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 The time would be where I was then 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
 really old fashioned in the catalogs 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 Looked that had ticked something 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 she wanted or yes I have it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 have cut out on then 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 serial killer and my parents 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 Even earlier , Amazon was the best 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 friend than honest time was 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.270
 was only once should come my grandpa came 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.530
 or my father as santa claus 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.180
 I did not dress at that time 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 I knew and gave me your gifts 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.150
 I was very happy 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.260
 and found this time really great because I 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.490
 still remembered today 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.900
 otherwise I have a memory like 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.250
 That's why I can do a swiss cheese 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.659
 partner recommend everyone should 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.920
 really get dressed twice 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 damn it is embarrassing or what too 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.750
 always 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.640
 he should do it is his 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.530
 children a nice memory of the past 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
 a little later you can spend the time where i am 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.200
 I just pushed out what 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.759
 i wanted to have given the parents and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040
 have been bought as well as it was possible 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.680
 well not everything but most because 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.549
 such a porsche with twelve that was such a 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.829
 other story 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.630
 but in spite of what worth considering 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.610
 finally the 24th of december it was called 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 I am present or with the Christmas tree 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.409
 Immediately unrestricted against 23 clock with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 belÃ¼lls unpacked the gifts 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.799
 the first time the years it has 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 worked well the second time it was 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.320
 then different again 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.909
 in the second I have something to me 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.740
 So my parents did not learn 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.210
 Awakened I had sneaked down 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 but no flashlight or other 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.259
 light so I had to grope but under 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.969
 the christmas tree nothing at all yes 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.070
 So turned on the light very briefly and 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.479
 yes it was a mistake under 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.490
 christmas tree nothing at all only one 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.200
 chit and on the piece of paper was one 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.149
 wait but rather that we are awake yes 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.890
 a real disappointment but I have 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.230
 seen across it and now it is 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 time is quiet and grown up and what 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.010
 everything made that happen again 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.660
 Meanwhile, it runs so that I the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 choose gifts I want 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.720
 and if it gets too expensive then I have to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.040
 a part of at the same time meanwhile 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.170
 I also lose a bit myself 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 I have to do it myself then 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.410
 I also have something more expensive then 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.580
 gifts and so they stayed that way 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.319
 Also send gifts to each other this 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.819
 run down and gifts 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.349
 to open up already to know what you have 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.989
 it does not exist anymore I do it completely 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.970
 normal and then goes down gdp but 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.549
 just because it no gifts and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.049
 in Hamburg does not have to wait to 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:48.880
 Outwardly I am old but inwardly I am 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:50.019
 I'm still 12 years old now you're writing 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.670

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.260

 until next time or until the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.660
 next advent and look forward to the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:15.100
 24 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:17.370
