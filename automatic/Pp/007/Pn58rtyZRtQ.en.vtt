when you put a mouthpiece into a trumpet
receiver<00:00:08.500> on<00:00:08.800> the<00:00:09.340> inside<00:00:09.700> there<00:00:09.970> ends<00:00:10.180> up

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
receiver on the inside there ends up

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.450 
receiver on the inside there ends up
being<00:00:10.299> a<00:00:10.570> space<00:00:10.930> in<00:00:11.620> between<00:00:11.920> where<00:00:12.340> the

being a space in between where the

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.430 
being a space in between where the
mouthpiece<00:00:12.910> ends<00:00:13.330> and<00:00:13.540> the<00:00:13.600> lead<00:00:13.780> pipe<00:00:14.020> begins

mouthpiece ends and the lead pipe begins

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.310 
mouthpiece ends and the lead pipe begins
and<00:00:14.770> this<00:00:15.520> space<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:15.940> called<00:00:16.360> the<00:00:16.630> annulus<00:00:17.080> or

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
and this space is called the annulus or

and this space is called the annulus or
the<00:00:17.650> gap<00:00:17.860> and<00:00:18.220> it<00:00:18.760> is<00:00:18.850> extremely<00:00:19.300> important<00:00:19.990> to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
the gap and it is extremely important to

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.499 
the gap and it is extremely important to
get<00:00:20.770> this<00:00:20.980> correct<00:00:21.400> if<00:00:21.640> you're<00:00:21.820> trying<00:00:22.240> to

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
get this correct if you're trying to

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.740 
get this correct if you're trying to
fine<00:00:22.779> tune<00:00:22.810> your<00:00:23.410> equipment<00:00:24.269> before<00:00:25.269> I<00:00:25.449> go<00:00:25.599> on

fine tune your equipment before I go on

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.109 
fine tune your equipment before I go on
a<00:00:25.779> little<00:00:26.019> bit<00:00:26.140> about<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:27.640> not<00:00:27.849> get

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
a little bit about that do not get

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.499 
a little bit about that do not get
confused<00:00:28.689> between<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.949> gap<00:00:30.189> and<00:00:30.550> how<00:00:31.029> far<00:00:31.359> the

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
confused between the gap and how far the

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.110 
confused between the gap and how far the
mouthpiece<00:00:31.929> sticks<00:00:32.290> out<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.680> trumpet

this<00:00:34.120> diagram<00:00:34.630> shows<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:34.960> two<00:00:35.620> different

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
this diagram shows you two different

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.250 
this diagram shows you two different
projections<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.120> mouthpiece<00:00:37.450> with<00:00:38.079> the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
projections of the mouthpiece with the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.040 
projections of the mouthpiece with the
same<00:00:38.469> gap<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:39.070> one<00:00:39.219> on<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.460> top<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:40.780> not

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
same gap the one on the top is not

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.260 
same gap the one on the top is not
sticking<00:00:41.410> out<00:00:41.620> as<00:00:41.800> far<00:00:42.039> as<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.910> one<00:00:43.059> on<00:00:43.090> the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
sticking out as far as the one on the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.849 
sticking out as far as the one on the
bottom<00:00:43.420> but<00:00:43.780> yet<00:00:43.899> on<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.109> inside<00:00:44.469> they<00:00:44.710> have

bottom but yet on the inside they have

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.340 
bottom but yet on the inside they have
the<00:00:45.010> same<00:00:45.250> gap<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:45.879> again<00:00:46.690> it's<00:00:46.840> this<00:00:47.020> gap

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the same gap and again it's this gap

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.650 
the same gap and again it's this gap
that's<00:00:47.859> the<00:00:48.100> important<00:00:48.640> thing<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:49.449> gap

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
that's the important thing the gap

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.410 
that's the important thing the gap
affects<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:51.070> way<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.460> horn<00:00:51.640> plays<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.239> back

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
affects the way the horn plays the back

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.990 
affects the way the horn plays the back
pressure<00:00:52.719> you<00:00:52.960> feel<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:54.160> can<00:00:54.550> affect<00:00:54.879> the

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
pressure you feel which can affect the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.869 
pressure you feel which can affect the
slotting<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:55.840> also<00:00:56.019> affects<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:57.309> tone<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.579> the

the mouthpiece put together there are
people<00:01:06.190> who<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:08.140> theories<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.070> can

in a certain mouthpiece require a
certain<00:01:14.350> gap<00:01:14.620> of<00:01:14.920> some<00:01:16.230> measurement<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:17.440> my

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
certain gap of some measurement and my

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.830 
certain gap of some measurement and my
studies<00:01:18.490> have<00:01:18.610> shown<00:01:18.820> me<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.660> just

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
studies have shown me that this is just

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.390 
studies have shown me that this is just
not<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.170> case<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.740> only<00:01:21.040> way<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.220> determine

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
not the case the only way to determine

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.760 
not the case the only way to determine
the<00:01:21.760> correct<00:01:22.000> gap<00:01:22.270> for<00:01:22.510> yourself<00:01:22.900> is<00:01:23.440> through

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the correct gap for yourself is through

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.030 
the correct gap for yourself is through
experimentation<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.790> discovery<00:01:25.360> for

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
experimentation and discovery for

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.220 
experimentation and discovery for
example<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.250> may<00:01:27.430> have<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.540> same<00:01:28.570> trumpet

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
example you may have the same trumpet

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.200 
example you may have the same trumpet
the<00:01:29.350> same<00:01:29.560> mouthpiece<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.400> different

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
the same mouthpiece and different

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.400 
the same mouthpiece and different
trumpet<00:01:31.540> players<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.140> you're<00:01:32.230> probably

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
trumpet players and you're probably

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.050 
trumpet players and you're probably
going<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:32.710> end<00:01:32.740> up<00:01:32.920> with<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.130> different<00:01:33.550> gap<00:01:33.760> if

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
going to end up with a different gap if

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.610 
going to end up with a different gap if
you're<00:01:34.270> trying<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.600> fine<00:01:34.810> tune<00:01:34.840> things<00:01:35.350> and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
you're trying to fine tune things and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.590 
you're trying to fine tune things and
the<00:01:36.130> main<00:01:36.310> reason<00:01:36.340> for<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.300> that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
the main reason for that is that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.570 
the main reason for that is that
different<00:01:38.290> treble<00:01:38.560> players<00:01:38.770> push<00:01:39.190> their<00:01:39.370> lips

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
different treble players push their lips

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.640 
different treble players push their lips
into<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.940> mouthpiece<00:01:40.420> by<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> different

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
into the mouthpiece by a different

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.140 
into the mouthpiece by a different
amount<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.250> affects<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.880> whole

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
amount and that affects the whole

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.440 
amount and that affects the whole
acoustic<00:01:44.110> setup<00:01:44.550> from<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.610> mouthpiece<00:01:45.910> end

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
acoustic setup from the mouthpiece end

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.380 
acoustic setup from the mouthpiece end
so<00:01:47.290> again<00:01:47.590> adjusting<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.310> gap<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.730> extremely

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
so again adjusting the gap is extremely

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.960 
so again adjusting the gap is extremely
important<00:01:49.900> if<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.320> want<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.680> maximize<00:01:50.980> not

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
important if you want to maximize not

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.830 
important if you want to maximize not
