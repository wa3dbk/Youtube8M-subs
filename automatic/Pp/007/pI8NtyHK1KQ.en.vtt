direction cars should be coming from is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
direction cars should be coming from is
oncoming<00:01:00.510> left<00:01:00.870> Turner's<00:01:01.350> which<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
oncoming left Turner's which in this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
thing is this I never want to stop here

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.380 
thing is this I never want to stop here
when<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.110> safe<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.619> finish<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:51.090> also

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
when it's safe to finish and I also

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.660 
when it's safe to finish and I also
never<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.950> miss<00:01:53.369> somebody

you<00:01:53.970> could<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.210> turning<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.990> other<00:01:55.140> thing<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you could be turning the other thing is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.679 
you could be turning the other thing is
this<00:01:55.740> even<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> left<00:01:57.329> Turner

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this even if there was a left Turner

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
this even if there was a left Turner
because<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.530> light<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:58.890> green<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.460> say<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
because the light was green will say and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.399 
because the light was green will say and
this<00:02:00.329> left<00:02:00.570> turn<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.020> here

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this left turn is here

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
this left turn is here
do<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.219> leave<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> exact<00:02:03.420> same<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:03.899> as

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
do not leave at the exact same time as

do not leave at the exact same time as
this<00:02:04.170> guys

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
this guys

this guys
through<00:02:04.930> because<00:02:05.680> if<00:02:06.010> they<00:02:06.460> turn<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:06.940> why

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
through because if they turn and why

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.300 
through because if they turn and why
ultimately<00:02:08.110> you're<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.650> one<00:02:08.830> leaving<00:02:09.100> a

they<00:02:14.410> might<00:02:14.590> go<00:02:14.830> wide<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.400> you're<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.000> one

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
they might go wide and you're the one

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.850 
they might go wide and you're the one
you<00:02:16.360> leave<00:02:16.570> in<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.840> yield<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.380> you'd<00:02:17.590> be<00:02:17.770> at

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you leave in the yield so you'd be at

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.830 
you leave in the yield so you'd be at
fault<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.030> be<00:02:19.120> careful<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.630> that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
fault so you have to be careful in that

scenario as well so that is the most

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
good plan and near the end reconfirm

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.640 
good plan and near the end reconfirm

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that plan do the appropriate thing at

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.070 
that plan do the appropriate thing at

that time so that should help you with
