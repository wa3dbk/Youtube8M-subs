00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 lemon pie with Italian meringue 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.210
 indicate two units of measures for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.559
 Ingredients ingredients for the dough 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.780
 ingredients for the filling 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.610
 ingredients for meringue 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.849
 and the following implements will be 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.740
 used for the manufacture before 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.950
 effect the preparation of the dough 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.050
 We will do the following to reduce 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.599
 the salmonella risk which is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 found in the shell and in the yolk 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.809
 we will extract the direct eggs from 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 refrigerator and we will wash them with water 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.540
 cool 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.550
 then we will remove them with a towel 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.380
 clean paper so we will avoid your 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.930
 contamination at the time of breaking the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.640
 shell we separate the whites and the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.829
 we keep in the refrigerator until the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 when they are going to be used 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 we will also leave ready the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.470
 portions of lemon zest mold 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.090
 we 'll leave it in butter 2 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.980
 preparation in a bowl we will mix the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.410
 margarine and sugar until it is 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.980
 creamy to join we will use only 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.280
 spatulas we will add the yolks one to 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.280
 a 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.790
 and we incorporate the milk 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.370
 and we add the lemon zest 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.630
 to facilitate mixing we add the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.630
 flour in two parts 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.899
 we incorporate the second half of the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.570
 flour this type of mixture do not knead 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.060
 it would be hard to join in 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.950
 this case only with spatula and will remain 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.850
 ready when you take off easily 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.850
 from the edges of the bowl 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.270
 We preheat the oven for 20 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.460
 minutes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 deposits the dough in the mold and places 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.390
 the center and with the palm of your hands' 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.610
 begins to shape 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.340
 it is important to press to leave it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.040
 thin and skin tight to the mold so 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.520
 will remain thick after cooking with 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.470
 a fork we puncture to avoid it 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.500
 implant cooking 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 and we take the cake to the oven for 25 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.950
 minutes 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.000
 after the time we removed the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.100
 oven pie 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.370
 when it is cooked the edges are 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.050
 they tend to come off 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.510
 preparation of the filling 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.850
 to begin we will prepare one of the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.160
 three milk houses in a jar 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.240
 we will put the cornstarch 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.850
 and the sugar 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.740
 and the three egg yolks now with the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.470
 spatula stir until everything is 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.540
 well incorporated we add a cup of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.570
 cold milk and we continue stirring 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.590
 to dissolve completely we will use the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.390
 manual beater 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.300
 and we will check with the spatula 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.730
 until there are no residues 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.980
 in the big pot we will deposit the two 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.450
 remaining milk cup 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.239
 and add the lemon zest 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.239
 stir and bring to medium heat 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.030
 When the milk begins to boil the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.920
 we took out and emptied it directly into the jar 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.470
 where was the previous mix so that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.990
 it is tempered then we stir and pour 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.520
 again the pot we put the pot in the 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.760
 burner and as soon as it starts to boil 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.440
 we leave on fire under stir 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.210
 vigorously with the manual beater 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.090
 Do not make lumps or stick 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.940
 we put out the fire but we continue 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.860
 stirring add the lemon juice and 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.819
 stir until everything is well 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.890
 United 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.930
 This mixture was poured into hot 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.680
 the base and it is paired while 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.389
 hot before it settles then it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.689
 leave in the refrigerator until it 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.689
 cool 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.940
 italian meringue preparation 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.780
 and we take out the whites from the refrigerator and 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.760
 we beat them until they reach volume 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.879
 and we leave to go to prepare the syrup 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 in a pot add the sugar and then 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.620
 we cover with water 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.830
 we lower the sugar residue with 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.320
 spatula we'll leave a half flame until 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.470
 reach the blast and this can be 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.110
 check with a thermometer at 116 degrees 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.890
 of temperature or you can also wait 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.480
 10 minutes later 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.780
 deposit some syrup in a cup 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.220
 with water if he will touch with his fingers 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.320
 form a blast then it 's ready 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.870
 we set the syrup to low flame and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.610
 we started to beat the meringue 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.430
 now we are incorporating the syrup 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.320
 slowly around the whites the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.210
 shake should be done until the 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.210
 base of the bowl is completely cold 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.300
 we empty the meringue and with the spatula 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.510
 we spread to form a surface 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.510
 smooth 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.050
 and now we will begin to decorate 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.970
 we will form little balls helped with a 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.820
 spoon and then we will make some 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.060
 grooves up the gold we do it 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.270
 with greening or with surrounding heat 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.250
 supervising so that it does not burn 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.920
 I'm a lemon also known as 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.630
 part of rudder or lemon pile dates from the 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.180
 medieval era in which it was served 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.430
 as dessert this dessert that contained 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.530
 Lemon was reserved only for 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.500
 more affluent classes because the 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.900
 Fruits were very expensive in the 17th century 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.120
 Merengue is perfected from 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.480
 19th century is elaborated as we know it 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.480
