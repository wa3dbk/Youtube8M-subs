00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.480
 turns into a celebration in something special 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.710
 today the fireworks are so sophisticated that it's easy to forget 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.769
 that are not a modern invention 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.279
 but you need a pyrotechnic to create a big bang 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.929
 the work of a pyrotechnic is to convert explosives into fires 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.029
 artificial 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.150
 the slightest spark of static electricity could make them detonate 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 that's why antistatic gloves are mandatory 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.730
 the fireworks are formed by several separate compartments 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.450
 inside a cartridge 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.480
 the wick explodes a compartment each time creating the explosions 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.240
 staggered in the sky 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.710
 the pyrotechnic sticks the main wick to the base of the cartridge first 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.600
 the tail is naturally colorless 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 but it has been dyed blue to know where it applies 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.730
 the base is set aside to work in the second compartment of the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.680
 teachers that consists of this model 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.840
 the first step is to put explosive powder in the center 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 after stage 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.110
 The next step begins with a cardboard cushion used to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 protect this compartment from the explosion of the first compartment 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.060
 then a corrugated cardboard disc and a separator are placed 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.880
 plastic 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.060
 the fuse will take two and a half seconds to burn these two components that creates a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 slight delay between the first explosion and the second 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.840
 Pasting the second compartment is complicated 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.900
 yes it was very tight cushion the explosion 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.760
 but it has to be tight enough to withstand the delay 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.550
 finished the second compartment it is time to prepare the first one dries the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.949
 case 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.389
 then filled with hundreds of stars the stars are the ones 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.319
 they create the flashes of color are explosives meticulously measured with 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.680
 coloring agents like magnesium to get the white copper salt for the 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.709
 blue and charcoal for orange 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.309
 the pyrotechnician must handle the purchase or they could detonate 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.229
 then add comets another type of explosive decoration 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.469
 and to top it off 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:56.420
 by last 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.160
 the two compartments are pasted I wanted to fill the gap with the same 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 combination of ingredients 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.329
 once the cartridge is full the lid is pasted 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.899
 and the tighter the better 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:27.579
 The more pressure accumulates stronger and more spectacular will be the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.929
 explosion 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.929
 then they are wrapped in a paper 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.019
 international color codes are used to indicate the size 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.129
 of a cartridge 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.739
 the propulsion charge a bag of gunpowder with a long wick and 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.019
 fast action goes on the base of the cartridge 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.229
 that's what throws the fireworks towards the idea 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.889
 When the main wick is lit simultaneously two wicks are lit 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:02.959
 high schools 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.659
 the delay wick that runs through the cartridge through the compartments of the 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.879
 explosives 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.159
 and the long wick that runs on the outside and goes to the propulsion load 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.159
 from the base 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.740
 once the profusion charge is on, almost heat accumulates inside the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.419
 launch tube until they explode to propel the fireworks to 300 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.419
 meters high 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.179
 let the light show begin
