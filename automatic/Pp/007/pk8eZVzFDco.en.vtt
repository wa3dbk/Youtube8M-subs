00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.729
 hello to you or to the channel 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.640
 Americans and today we arrived 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:11.570
 in the evening in an institution then called 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.060
 if it's fast food we eat very fast food 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.720
 so rarely did I decide to take advantage 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 shoot here the food that we will buy 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 but it's not exactly such a hamburger 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.189
 and cheeseburger habitual here is chicken 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.619
 like chicken sandwich 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.720
 I like to buy there 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.020
 tasty salad is also an ordinary vegetable 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.030
 chicken salad so not exactly 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.360
 typical fast food therefore wanted it 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.400
 show and by the way this is fastfood names here 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.200
 whether in our state only Georgia then 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.060
 whether that's that southeast so he is 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.920
 not everywhere in the country 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.920
 here I can drive the internal magician 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 interior 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.060
 here if you order and sweet tea 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.340

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 if you drank you can still opposite this 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.280

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.280

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.460

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.900

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.100

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 two kinds of which species 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.189

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.189

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 various choose now ordered here 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.320

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.840
 we visit Pakhuda it is so extreme 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.550
 the case is simple today there was no time 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.890
 cook and so we decided to eat 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 and we had such cards here you 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.920

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.480
 buy there for a gift to someone on 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
 different amounts and a person will be able 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.940
 take advantage when titanfall and dine 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.770

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.700
