then<00:00:50.440> there<00:00:50.620> are<00:00:50.860> various<00:00:51.250> places<00:00:51.520> in<00:00:51.850> which

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
then there are various places in which

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.240 
then there are various places in which
things<00:00:52.300> actually<00:00:52.719> get<00:00:52.960> assembled<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.860> this

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
things actually get assembled and this

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
is just one of those places that is is

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.400 
is just one of those places that is is
the<00:00:58.899> biggest<00:00:59.260> piece<00:00:59.860> of<00:00:59.920> assembly<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.960> I've

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
the biggest piece of assembly that I've

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.760 
the biggest piece of assembly that I've
ever<00:01:02.649> got<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:03.010> see<00:01:03.479> but<00:01:04.479> there's<00:01:04.960> no<00:01:05.140> denying

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
ever got to see but there's no denying

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.590 
ever got to see but there's no denying
that<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:06.700> incredibly<00:01:08.670> exhilarating<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.450> it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
that it's incredibly exhilarating and it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.279 
that it's incredibly exhilarating and it
gives<00:01:10.899> off<00:01:11.140> this<00:01:12.690> mercantile<00:01:13.690> energy<00:01:14.110> which

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
gives off this mercantile energy which

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.499 
gives off this mercantile energy which
of<00:01:14.470> course<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.830> then<00:01:15.209> attached<00:01:16.209> to<00:01:16.420> why

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
of course is then attached to why

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.210 
of course is then attached to why
artists<00:01:16.899> like<00:01:17.110> being<00:01:17.319> in<00:01:17.410> this<00:01:17.560> city<00:01:17.770> because

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
artists like being in this city because

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.380 
artists like being in this city because
it's

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
it's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.130 
it's
very<00:01:21.050> energetic<00:01:21.940> but<00:01:22.940> pathetic<00:01:23.570> because<00:01:23.900> it

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
very energetic but pathetic because it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.690 
very energetic but pathetic because it
this<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.560> nine<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.860> we're<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.280> 19th

you<00:01:31.190> know<00:01:31.520> in<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.760> bit<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.000> 20th<00:01:32.360> century<00:01:32.480> just

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
you know in a bit of 20th century just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.820 
you know in a bit of 20th century just
went<00:01:33.020> by<00:01:34.540> London<00:01:35.540> has<00:01:35.660> been<00:01:35.780> my<00:01:35.990> studio<00:01:36.440> in<00:01:36.710> a

way that is then allowed the world to be
my<00:01:41.710> my<00:01:42.710> palette<00:01:43.160> I<00:01:43.370> mean<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.180> an<00:01:44.300> appalling

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
my my palette I mean it's an appalling

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
my my palette I mean it's an appalling
19th<00:01:45.890> century<00:01:46.340> state<00:01:46.700> but<00:01:47.050> but<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:49.520> that's

19th century state but but but that's
all<00:01:50.150> that<00:01:50.330> artists<00:01:50.660> do<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:50.900> mean<00:01:51.229> they're<00:01:51.410> just

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
all that artists do I mean they're just

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.440 
all that artists do I mean they're just
they're<00:01:53.979> foragers<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.310> know<00:01:55.430> what<00:01:55.880> what<00:01:56.300> are

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
they're foragers you know what what are

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.910 
they're foragers you know what what are
those<00:01:56.570> beasts<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.280> know<00:01:58.430> grazers<00:01:59.270> I

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
those beasts that you know grazers I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.800 
those beasts that you know grazers I
suppose<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.130> thing<00:02:01.160> that<00:02:01.729> I've<00:02:02.720> come<00:02:02.750> to

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
suppose the thing that I've come to

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.510 
suppose the thing that I've come to
value<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.380> particular<00:02:06.710> city<00:02:07.130> but<00:02:07.399> it's

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
value in this particular city but it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.120 
value in this particular city but it's
true<00:02:07.729> another<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.300> true<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.630> cities<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.320> how

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
true another it's true in cities is how

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.430 
true another it's true in cities is how
contradictory<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.660> energies<00:02:12.110> are

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
contradictory it is so the energies are

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.120 
contradictory it is so the energies are
all<00:02:15.700> coalescing<00:02:16.700> they're<00:02:17.300> all<00:02:17.420> side-by-side

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.860 

simultaneously<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.550> somehow<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.420> adds<00:02:23.570> up<00:02:23.810> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
simultaneously and somehow it adds up to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.940 
simultaneously and somehow it adds up to
some<00:02:24.320> kind<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.920> mass<00:02:25.760> function<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:27.200> know<00:02:27.320> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
some kind of mass function you know the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.410 
some kind of mass function you know the
man<00:02:28.130> who<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:28.430> dropped<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.730> piece<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.180> steel

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
man who just dropped that piece of steel

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.289 
man who just dropped that piece of steel
doesn't<00:02:30.410> know<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.160> heard<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.209> know

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
doesn't know that I heard it you know

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.690 
doesn't know that I heard it you know
and<00:02:32.510> maybe<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.950> somebody<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.459> floor

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
and maybe just somebody on the floor
