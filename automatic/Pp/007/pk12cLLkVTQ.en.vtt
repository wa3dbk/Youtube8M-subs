slides<00:00:43.460> on<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.120> here<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.540> that's<00:00:44.839> what's

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
slides on it here and that's what's

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.049 
slides on it here and that's what's
going<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.350> be<00:00:45.530> wearing<00:00:45.980> because<00:00:46.280> on<00:00:46.520> this<00:00:46.700> unit

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
going to be wearing because on this unit

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.700 
going to be wearing because on this unit
you're<00:00:47.149> basically<00:00:47.570> going<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.840> let<00:00:48.200> it<00:00:48.230> all<00:00:48.530> the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
you're basically going to let it all the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.950 
you're basically going to let it all the
way<00:00:48.860> down<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.489> let<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.149> follow<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.690> ground

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
way down and let it follow the ground

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.020 
way down and let it follow the ground
that's<00:00:51.289> why<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.559> back<00:00:51.949> of<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:52.309> is<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:52.820> much

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
that's why the back of this is so much

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.049 
that's why the back of this is so much
longer<00:00:53.390> than<00:00:54.140> where<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.530> blades<00:00:54.800> are<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.879> when

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
longer than where the blades are so when

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.910 
longer than where the blades are so when
it's<00:00:56.180> out<00:00:56.539> going<00:00:56.870> over<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.350> ground<00:00:57.649> it

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's out going over the ground it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.979 
it's out going over the ground it
doesn't<00:00:57.949> just<00:00:58.550> follow<00:00:58.850> every<00:00:59.270> little<00:00:59.510> dip<00:00:59.750> it

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
doesn't just follow every little dip it

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.540 
doesn't just follow every little dip it
gives<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.350> some<00:01:00.559> length<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.129> it's<00:01:01.340> going<00:01:01.489> to

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
gives it some length so it's going to

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.660 
gives it some length so it's going to
just<00:01:01.789> make<00:01:01.969> a<00:01:02.000> leveler<00:01:02.739> area<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:04.339> will<00:01:04.550> be

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
just make a leveler area this will be

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.719 
just make a leveler area this will be
great<00:01:05.000> mainly<00:01:05.539> to<00:01:05.810> keep<00:01:06.259> up<00:01:06.800> a<00:01:06.920> long<00:01:07.160> gravel

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
great mainly to keep up a long gravel

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.850 
great mainly to keep up a long gravel
road<00:01:07.940> something<00:01:08.570> like<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.990> we're<00:01:09.229> just<00:01:09.259> flat

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
road something like that we're just flat

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.070 
road something like that we're just flat
is<00:01:10.130> absolutely<00:01:10.850> what<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.210> want<00:01:11.420> had<00:01:12.050> a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
is absolutely what you want had a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.840 
is absolutely what you want had a
customer<00:01:12.679> yesterday<00:01:13.160> asked<00:01:13.490> me<00:01:13.610> how<00:01:13.789> he

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
customer yesterday asked me how he

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.840 
customer yesterday asked me how he
thought<00:01:14.179> this<00:01:14.420> would<00:01:14.660> do<00:01:14.899> for<00:01:15.850> final

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
thought this would do for final

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.060 
thought this would do for final
preparation<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:17.750> doing<00:01:18.200> like<00:01:18.530> around<00:01:18.860> a

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
preparation for doing like around a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.580 
preparation for doing like around a
house<00:01:19.280> well<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.090> think<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.689> would<00:01:20.810> do<00:01:20.990> fine<00:01:21.290> on

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
house well I think it would do fine on

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.010 
house well I think it would do fine on
getting<00:01:21.979> level<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.000> only<00:01:23.210> problem<00:01:23.720> with<00:01:23.840> this

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
getting level the only problem with this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.260 
getting level the only problem with this
being<00:01:24.350> your<00:01:24.500> final<00:01:25.040> tool<00:01:25.280> would<00:01:25.520> be<00:01:25.729> that

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
being your final tool would be that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.840 
being your final tool would be that
anywhere<00:01:26.780> where<00:01:27.200> did<00:01:27.409> cut<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.070> material<00:01:28.250> off

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
anywhere where did cut the material off

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.090 
anywhere where did cut the material off
the<00:01:29.119> top<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.689> level<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.619> would<00:01:30.770> still<00:01:31.070> be

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
the top to level it it would still be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.249 
the top to level it it would still be
hard<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.119> would<00:01:32.329> probably<00:01:32.540> need<00:01:32.930> something

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
hard and would probably need something

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.410 
hard and would probably need something
like<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> pulverizer<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.579> rough<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.970> up<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.299> get

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
like a pulverizer to rough it up to get

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.780 
like a pulverizer to rough it up to get
your<00:01:35.600> grass<00:01:35.840> seat<00:01:36.170> going<00:01:36.439> but<00:01:37.130> for<00:01:37.310> everything

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
your grass seat going but for everything

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.060 
your grass seat going but for everything
else<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.360> if<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.710> land

else for if this is a this is a land

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.490 
else for if this is a this is a land
leveler<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:40.880> if<00:01:41.329> level<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:41.840> what<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:42.259> want

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
leveler and if level is what you want

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.069 
leveler and if level is what you want
this<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.460> right<00:01:43.640> tool<00:01:43.970> because<00:01:44.810> that's

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
this is the right tool because that's

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.960 
this is the right tool because that's
what<00:01:45.290> it's<00:01:45.409> all<00:01:45.590> about<00:01:45.619> with<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.220> twin<00:01:46.490> edges

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
what it's all about with the twin edges

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.359 
what it's all about with the twin edges
on<00:01:47.149> an<00:01:47.270> angle<00:01:47.659> like<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.470> cutting<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
on an angle like this and cutting the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.999 
on an angle like this and cutting the
dirt<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.270> can't<00:01:50.630> let<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.049> dip<00:01:51.290> way<00:01:51.530> down<00:01:51.799> in

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
dirt and it can't let it dip way down in

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.859 
dirt and it can't let it dip way down in
like<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.250> box<00:01:52.579> blade<00:01:52.880> because<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.390> has<00:01:53.509> such<00:01:53.840> a

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
like a box blade because it has such a

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.590 
like a box blade because it has such a
long<00:01:54.200> slide<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.549> keep<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.939> level<00:01:56.180> and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
long slide on it to keep it level and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.289 
long slide on it to keep it level and
from<00:01:56.840> dipping<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.829> it's<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.100> unique<00:01:58.430> tool<00:01:58.700> it's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299
