00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 Let's do the cantabile for the teeth by saying yes What do you teach today? 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:15.089
 Today is about the relationship between the piano and the song structure Why does the piano perform the song with one instrument 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:20.020
 Impossible only'm to plump copy a song is or certainly guitar It is a story of what can play 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.440
 I played the piano in an easy-to-understand manner, so please take a look at that one shot 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.140
 I'm taking a bit of a mistake, but let's see it without worrying 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.140
 Please pay attention there because we pull overlapping the sound 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.890
 At first it is the bass sound that becomes the foundation of the song 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.300
 That's the base charge if referred to in the band 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.490
 Hmm 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.960
 Melody enters here 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.960
 If it says in a band, it is a vocal 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.860
 At this point I can express two instruments with one piano 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.760
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.380
 Make the chord progression clear by turning the left hand on 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.380
 It's a guitar player 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.880
 And make the foil clear by putting rhythm on the base 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.880
 If it says in the band, the bass and the drum are doing it 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.070
 At this point all the instruments of the band can be expressed with one piano 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.980
 ni 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.549
 And if you add an arrangement like a piano to this 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.819
 me 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.569
 car 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.569
 me 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.230
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.959
 goo 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:12.450
 It seems like this is how you can play various songs with one piano 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:17.519
 Useless if the underlying piano's gonna be jammed to the very hard piano music does not practice 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.879
 Did you understand the importance of the piano this time by saying so ? 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.970
 There is nothing to do next time, so I will look for news 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.280
 Well then everyone 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.280
 I will enjoy the music next time
