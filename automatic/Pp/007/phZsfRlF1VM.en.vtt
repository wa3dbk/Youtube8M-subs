00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
out in front of the Baker hotel we were

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.620 
out in front of the Baker hotel we were
walking<00:01:21.200> with<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.350> group<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:22.789> pictures<00:01:23.509> are

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
walking with a group the pictures are

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.690 
walking with a group the pictures are
kind<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.990> dark<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.619> can<00:01:24.649> see<00:01:24.770> some<00:01:25.189> detail

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
kind of dark but you can see some detail

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.529 
kind of dark but you can see some detail
in<00:01:26.000> them<00:01:26.950> this<00:01:27.950> looks<00:01:28.219> like<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.610> pool<00:01:28.850> area<00:01:29.149> I

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
in them this looks like the pool area I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.679 
in them this looks like the pool area I
think<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:32.780> is<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.799> side<00:01:34.100> which<00:01:34.689> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
think and this is the side which the

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.219 
think and this is the side which the
camera<00:01:36.200> started<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:37.450> lose<00:01:38.450> battery

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
camera started to lose battery

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.380 
camera started to lose battery
I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:40.070> he's<00:01:40.189> picking<00:01:40.430> Colleen<00:01:40.939> Jeter<00:01:41.359> on

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
I think he's picking Colleen Jeter on

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.660 
I think he's picking Colleen Jeter on
took<00:01:41.719> this<00:01:41.960> one<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.500> there's<00:01:42.920> an<00:01:43.070> orb<00:01:43.369> and

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
took this one and there's an orb and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.560 
took this one and there's an orb and
appeared<00:01:43.969> right<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.270> front<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:44.689> my<00:01:44.810> face

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
appeared right in front of my face

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.910 
appeared right in front of my face
