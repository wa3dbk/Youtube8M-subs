 person has 2 20 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.459
 the android system 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.149
 If you want to change the color, too. 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.459
 I just came here to source venice 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.219

 in case you guys want to illustrate the dvd everything if it were beauty 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.339
 the ces coming here in these options all that apparently is a thing is the 

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:36.699
 tonic of the post-crisis demonstrated button 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:37.949
 which is very important 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.430
 the dvd always try 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.520
 David Heiss always has to have or so 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.710
 in my personal case 2 20 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.789
 so it hurt so much more 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.750
 if you have more decent and dvd 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.889

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:19.409
 important
