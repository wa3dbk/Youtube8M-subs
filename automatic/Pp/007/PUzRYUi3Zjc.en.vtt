00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello good today let's see how to see the 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:12.880
 free football with rojadirecta let's go to 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.880
 google and then we look for direct red 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.380
 we go to redirect 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.480
 and here we can see the different 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.070
 sporting events 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.359
 for example, we choose uefa champions 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.180
 great madrid league 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.670
 borussia of dortmund 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.920
 click and here the different 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.930
 channels where we can see them 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.190
 you can see where it puts p2p 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.750
 you can see 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.750
 where does web flash 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.290
 streaming 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 there are many types and depending on what 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 you want to see it can give problems one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 to one give problems normally the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 Flash broadcasts look a little 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.390
 worse but they go fluid in p2p this of by 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390
 here 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.180
 they can look pretty better but sometimes 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.290
 there are cuts depends on the fate of the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.770
 connection for example we choose one 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.770
 anyone 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.860
 come back 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.860
 or a failure this happens a lot 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.070
 we look for another one for example blue and white 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.070
 57 click on see 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.509
 and this loads the window where it would start 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.000
 football or if it's good in this case 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.670
 it's not soccer because it's in the middle 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 weather 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.759
 but on this screen would appear the 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.759
 football 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.850
 and here you can see the football that you see 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.510
 relatively well although sometimes there 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.510
 jump 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.619
 that's how I've commented before 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 connections by p2p sometimes fail a 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.200
 little they are going to jumps 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.380
 but they know better the connections to see 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.720
 flash by web 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.450
 they go less assaults goes everything more fluid 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.170
 but it looks pretty but that's already a 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.170
 consumer taste 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 and have a little bit of luck and find 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.880
 a connection that is stable and that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.640
 work well as you can see is something 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.319
 very simple and easy to make 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.800
 you just have to be lucky and 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.150
 find a channel that 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.150
 that works fast 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.280
 and nothing but a greeting and even another
