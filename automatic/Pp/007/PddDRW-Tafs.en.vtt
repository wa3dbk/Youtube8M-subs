00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:11.099
 and the green plants the roses 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.959
 bushes or trees like citrus 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.269
 they are very cultivated as plants 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.950
 ornamentals are examples that with the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.700
 They can be made very 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.890
 big 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.510
 think that in general the plants how much 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.420
 more possibility have to make roots 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.009
 greatest end up being this what 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.470
 impact is that your needs 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.570
 nutrients are going to be bigger by 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.130
 both to meet the needs of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.260
 these plants it is best to use 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.230
 regulated fertilizers that apply 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.480
 normally every four weeks a very 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.690
 good option is novatech blue fertilizer 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.250
 universal this subscription apart from serving 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 for the mentioned ornamentals 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.990
 you can also use it for garden 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.450
 for vegetables and even for grass 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.610
 it's worth stopping to read the 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.560
 instructions that are on the packaging already 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.780
 that in them you will find the doses 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.880
 suitable for each type of plant and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.000
 even if you want to use it as 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.070
 Background fertilization prior to planting 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.259
 in the case that you have pots 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.980
 you can also apply it for 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.140
 it 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.570
 dilute we have a teaspoon of product 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.820
 in five liters of water and we will apply to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 through irrigation 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.480
 novatech universal blue manure is a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.560
 new generation and high fertilizer 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.290
 performance your blue balls guarantee 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 the stability of nitrogen in the soil 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.740
 greater use of 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 nutrients from the plant and by 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.590
 so much better training of our 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.930
 plants plus novatech comes with a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.270
 improved formula lower in phosphorus what 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.550
 that makes it a more respectful fertilizer 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.190
 with the environment let's talk about 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.140
 this one paid a little more in detail 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.270
 novatech is a complex fertilizer that is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.550
 contains the essential nutrients for 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.610
 your plants like phosphorus nitrogen 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.320
 potassium magnesium sulfur and micro 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.900
 elements such as boron iron or 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.480
 zinc but the thing does not end here 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.820
 novatech and incorporates the one of mtp a 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.130
 nitrification inhibitor which is what 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.410
 What does this inhibitor do? 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.420
 nitrogen that we provide through 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.880
 fertilizer remains in the form of ammonium 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.610
 avoiding forms such as nitrates that 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.830
 are potentially polluting the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 which is a great fertilizer 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.630
 High performance and respectful efficiency 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.850
 environmentally a way 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.350
 feed your plants that will do 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 that you take out of them the maximum 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.600
 performance and look with all the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.600
 splendor
