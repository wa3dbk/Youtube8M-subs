detours<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> whole<00:00:40.379> album<00:00:40.620> itself<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
detours and the whole album itself was a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.209 
detours and the whole album itself was a
pretty<00:00:42.149> short<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> breath<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.350> still<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> LP

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and Holly kind of sounded like they were

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.130 
and Holly kind of sounded like they were
onto<00:00:46.980> something<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> newest<00:00:48.780> LP

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

onto something and with this newest LP
over<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.860> wouldn't<00:00:50.399> necessarily<00:00:50.760> say

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
over here I wouldn't necessarily say

over here I wouldn't necessarily say
it's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> more<00:00:51.840> coherent<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.149> more<00:00:54.149> enjoyable

record<00:00:55.289> than<00:00:55.739> movement<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.640> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
record than movement but it is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.630 
record than movement but it is
definitely<00:00:57.090> longer<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.289> shows<00:00:58.680> Holly<00:00:59.129> trying

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to flesh out some of the ideas on her

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
there wasn't anything too intriguing or

there wasn't anything too intriguing or
moving<00:02:51.520> about<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:52.000> then<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:52.570> have<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.750> song

points<00:05:49.539> with<00:05:49.659> the<00:05:49.750> vocals<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.349> then<00:05:50.770> we're

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
points with the vocals and then we're

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.230 
points with the vocals and then we're
just<00:05:50.919> getting<00:05:51.250> these<00:05:51.399> completely<00:05:51.879> just

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
just getting these completely just

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.649 
just getting these completely just
whacked<00:05:52.899> out<00:05:53.370> ideas<00:05:54.370> kind<00:05:54.819> of<00:05:54.939> like<00:05:55.149> lonely<00:05:55.569> at

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
whacked out ideas kind of like lonely at

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.899 
whacked out ideas kind of like lonely at
the<00:05:55.719> top<00:05:55.839> if<00:05:56.770> there<00:05:57.250> was<00:05:57.370> just<00:05:57.399> a<00:05:57.610> little<00:05:57.729> bit

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
the top if there was just a little bit

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.119 
the top if there was just a little bit
more<00:05:58.060> crossover<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.169> could<00:05:59.620> have<00:05:59.740> seen<00:05:59.949> this

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
more crossover I could have seen this

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.909 
more crossover I could have seen this
album<00:06:00.580> being<00:06:00.819> more<00:06:01.620> consistent<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:02.740> maybe

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
album being more consistent and maybe

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.800 
album being more consistent and maybe
even<00:06:03.219> more<00:06:03.310> interesting<00:06:03.849> too<00:06:04.089> because<00:06:04.300> I<00:06:04.569> mean

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
even more interesting too because I mean

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.709 
even more interesting too because I mean
you<00:06:04.960> know<00:06:05.050> some<00:06:05.349> pop<00:06:06.219> song<00:06:06.669> were<00:06:07.089> to<00:06:07.360> kind<00:06:07.659> of

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
you know some pop song were to kind of

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.040 
you know some pop song were to kind of
develop<00:06:08.080> out<00:06:08.439> of<00:06:08.649> that<00:06:08.830> ASMR<00:06:09.699> vocal<00:06:10.659> sound

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
develop out of that ASMR vocal sound

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.769 
develop out of that ASMR vocal sound
that<00:06:11.949> could<00:06:12.129> actually<00:06:12.279> be<00:06:12.669> you<00:06:13.029> know<00:06:13.060> kind<00:06:13.629> of

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
that could actually be you know kind of

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.170 
that could actually be you know kind of
refreshing<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:14.860> new<00:06:15.339> I<00:06:15.580> liked<00:06:15.849> the<00:06:15.969> song<00:06:16.149> and

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
exit as well which also features a

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.939

primal feel to this rhythm is one of the

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.540 
primal feel to this rhythm is one of the
more<00:06:35.319> exciting<00:06:35.680> and<00:06:35.979> hard

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
more exciting and hard

experiments and glitches and
manipulations<00:06:43.360> are<00:06:43.630> much<00:06:44.530> stranger<00:06:45.130> as

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
manipulations are much stranger as

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.580 
manipulations are much stranger as
strange<00:06:46.060> as<00:06:46.270> what<00:06:46.450> they<00:06:46.720> used<00:06:46.900> to<00:06:47.020> be<00:06:47.320> on

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
strange as what they used to be on

strange as what they used to be on
movement<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:49.480> they<00:06:49.960> just<00:06:50.140> don't<00:06:50.320> seem<00:06:50.530> to<00:06:50.680> be

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
movement the they just don't seem to be

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.760 
movement the they just don't seem to be
as<00:06:51.040> out<00:06:51.250> there<00:06:51.700> on<00:06:51.940> this<00:06:52.150> record<00:06:52.770> consistently

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
as out there on this record consistently

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.310 
as out there on this record consistently
and<00:06:54.010> and<00:06:55.000> Dow<00:06:55.240> definitely<00:06:55.810> sticks<00:06:56.110> out

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
and and Dow definitely sticks out

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.050 
and and Dow definitely sticks out
because<00:06:56.650> of<00:06:56.830> that<00:06:56.980> sonically<00:06:57.700> this<00:06:57.910> is<00:06:58.030> a

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
because of that sonically this is a

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.240 
because of that sonically this is a
pretty<00:06:58.270> chilling<00:06:58.690> track<00:06:59.200> as<00:06:59.470> well<00:06:59.950> there's

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
pretty chilling track as well there's

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.190 
pretty chilling track as well there's
something<00:07:00.430> very<00:07:00.580> fearful<00:07:01.030> about<00:07:01.720> the<00:07:02.050> way

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.200 
something very fearful about the way

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.740 
something very fearful about the way
this<00:07:02.470> instrumental<00:07:03.010> sounds<00:07:03.670> and<00:07:03.910> I<00:07:04.150> liked<00:07:04.570> it

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
this instrumental sounds and I liked it

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.010 
this instrumental sounds and I liked it
it<00:07:04.840> was<00:07:04.960> very<00:07:05.020> nice<00:07:05.410> change<00:07:06.280> of<00:07:06.460> mood<00:07:07.020> overall

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
it was very nice change of mood overall

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.550 
it was very nice change of mood overall
this<00:07:08.440> wasn't<00:07:08.860> a<00:07:09.250> bad<00:07:09.700> LP<00:07:10.300> it<00:07:10.570> was<00:07:10.750> decent<00:07:11.110> I

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
this wasn't a bad LP it was decent I

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.980 
this wasn't a bad LP it was decent I
wouldn't<00:07:12.100> say<00:07:12.250> it<00:07:12.370> was<00:07:12.490> more<00:07:12.760> exciting<00:07:13.420> than

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
wouldn't say it was more exciting than

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.570 
wouldn't say it was more exciting than
movement<00:07:14.560> it<00:07:14.710> just<00:07:14.920> felt<00:07:15.100> like<00:07:15.160> the<00:07:15.400> more

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
movement it just felt like the more

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.280 
movement it just felt like the more
experimental<00:07:16.210> tracks<00:07:16.510> weren't<00:07:16.870> really<00:07:17.110> that

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.290 
experimental tracks weren't really that

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.160 
experimental tracks weren't really that
attention-grabbing<00:07:18.220> or<00:07:18.670> awe-inspiring<00:07:19.600> and

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.170 
attention-grabbing or awe-inspiring and

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.280 
attention-grabbing or awe-inspiring and
the<00:07:20.350> poppier<00:07:20.800> songs<00:07:21.160> just<00:07:21.660> you<00:07:22.660> know<00:07:22.780> weren't

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
the poppier songs just you know weren't

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.800 
the poppier songs just you know weren't
really<00:07:23.740> sticking<00:07:24.520> with<00:07:24.700> me<00:07:24.910> and<00:07:25.120> after<00:07:25.780> a

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
really sticking with me and after a

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.600 
really sticking with me and after a
while<00:07:26.020> just<00:07:26.200> kind<00:07:26.530> of<00:07:26.590> became<00:07:26.920> background

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
while just kind of became background

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.340
