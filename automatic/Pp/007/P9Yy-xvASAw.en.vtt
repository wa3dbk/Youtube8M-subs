00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
up things like the Infinity we really

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.610 
up things like the Infinity we really
wanted<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.210> start<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.720> bring<00:01:17.960> sort<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.530> the

all<00:01:20.960> together<00:01:21.170> into<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> piece<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.100> would

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
all together into a piece that would

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.330 
all together into a piece that would
