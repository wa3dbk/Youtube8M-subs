00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130

of the offspring of these and but you'll
get<00:01:32.030> several<00:01:32.510> smaller<00:01:32.870> pieces<00:01:33.729> because<00:01:34.729> I've

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
get several smaller pieces because I've

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.440 
get several smaller pieces because I've
tried<00:01:35.780> before<00:01:36.410> in<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.490> past<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.030> send<00:01:38.300> out

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
large chunks like this just trying to be

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.870 
large chunks like this just trying to be
generous<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.020> give<00:01:42.080> more<00:01:42.410> but<00:01:42.680> what<00:01:43.340> happens

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
because you know the post-office will

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.560 
because you know the post-office will
just<00:01:51.410> fill<00:01:51.680> these<00:01:51.920> large<00:01:52.250> chunks<00:01:52.910> and<00:01:53.119> be<00:01:53.300> like

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
just fill these large chunks and be like

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.240 
just fill these large chunks and be like
you<00:01:53.780> know<00:01:53.930> what's<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.800> you<00:01:54.950> can't

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
you know what's this and you can't

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
you know what's this and you can't
really<00:01:55.610> be<00:01:55.790> sending<00:01:56.420> out<00:01:57.820> living<00:01:58.820> organisms<00:01:59.750> I

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
really be sending out living organisms I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.710 
really be sending out living organisms I
guess<00:02:00.400> across<00:02:01.400> borders<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.060> stuff<00:02:02.509> without

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
guess across borders and stuff without

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.109 
guess across borders and stuff without
all<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.830> stuff<00:02:04.190> going<00:02:04.460> through<00:02:04.759> quarantine

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
all this stuff going through quarantine

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.460 
all this stuff going through quarantine
and<00:02:05.869> all<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.170> crap<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.110> said<00:02:09.259> what<00:02:09.440> I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
and all this crap so like I said what I

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.710 
and all this crap so like I said what I
do<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:09.920> break<00:02:10.610> off<00:02:10.820> little<00:02:11.060> pieces<00:02:11.239> and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
do is just break off little pieces and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.420 
do is just break off little pieces and
then<00:02:11.840> you'll<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.680> get<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.890> lot<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.190> little

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
then you'll just get a lot of little

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.550 
then you'll just get a lot of little
pieces<00:02:13.640> but<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.900> won't<00:02:15.080> have<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.350> worry

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
pieces but you won't have to worry

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.300 
pieces but you won't have to worry
because<00:02:15.830> over<00:02:16.730> time<00:02:17.530> depending<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.830> time<00:02:19.100> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
because over time depending on time and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.009 
because over time depending on time and
temperature<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.060> mean<00:02:20.239> those<00:02:20.450> things<00:02:20.750> will

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
temperature I mean those things will

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.280 
temperature I mean those things will
grow<00:02:21.230> into<00:02:22.209> giant<00:02:23.209> chunks<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.170> mean

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
grow into giant chunks like this I mean

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.940 
grow into giant chunks like this I mean
even<00:02:24.620> larger<00:02:25.040> than<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:25.430> even<00:02:26.330> though<00:02:26.510> that's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
even larger than this even though that's

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.770 
even larger than this even though that's
unnecessary<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.220> all<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:28.940> telling<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.540> is

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
unnecessary but all I'm telling you is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.160 
unnecessary but all I'm telling you is

little same environment so they were

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.960 
little same environment so they were
strong<00:03:40.760> enough<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.500> survive<00:03:42.500> for<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.670> long

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
strong enough to survive for that long

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.080 
strong enough to survive for that long
period<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.510> time<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.709> said<00:03:46.010> I've<00:03:46.909> got

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
period of time and like I said I've got

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.360

some<00:03:47.269> healthy<00:03:47.599> little<00:03:47.750> babies<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.500> inside<00:03:49.340> of

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
some healthy little babies so inside of

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.390 
some healthy little babies so inside of
Europe<00:03:49.879> you'll<00:03:50.510> get<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:50.930> about<00:03:51.230> two<00:03:52.099> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
Europe you'll get it in about two to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.569 
Europe you'll get it in about two to
four<00:03:52.640> days<00:03:52.879> but<00:03:53.690> outside<00:03:54.170> of<00:03:54.349> Europe<00:03:54.739> you're

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
four days but outside of Europe you're

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.800 
four days but outside of Europe you're
looking<00:03:56.000> probably<00:03:57.670> seven<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.879> ten<00:03:59.180> days<00:03:59.420> I

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
looking probably seven to ten days I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.500 
looking probably seven to ten days I
guess<00:04:00.230> is<00:04:00.500> about<00:04:00.650> average<00:04:01.430> like<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.150> said<00:04:02.390> you

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
guess is about average like I said you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.069 
guess is about average like I said you
might<00:04:02.720> get<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:03.079> sooner<00:04:03.560> than<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:04.069> so<00:04:04.930> if<00:04:05.930> you

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
might get it sooner than that so if you

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.110 
might get it sooner than that so if you
want<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.410> know<00:04:06.560> what<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.459> do<00:04:07.640> with<00:04:07.940> these

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
want to know what to do with these

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.809 
want to know what to do with these
puppies<00:04:08.660> when<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.500> when<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.069> first<00:04:10.310> get<00:04:10.640> them
