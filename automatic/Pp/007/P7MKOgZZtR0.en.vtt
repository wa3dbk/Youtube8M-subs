00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
hey guys I'm here at TechShop and you

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.709 
hey guys I'm here at TechShop and you
might<00:00:07.740> have<00:00:07.859> noticed<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.550> SIM<00:00:09.030> card<00:00:09.059> is

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
might have noticed that the SIM card is

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.690 
might have noticed that the SIM card is
shrinking<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> little<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:11.280> helped<00:00:11.490> some

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
shrinking a little it's helped some

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.730 
shrinking a little it's helped some
Micro<00:00:12.179> SIM<00:00:12.240> format<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.530> lot<00:00:13.710> of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
Micro SIM format and a lot of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.620 
Micro SIM format and a lot of
international<00:00:14.309> phones<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.240> even<00:00:15.330> things

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
international phones and even things

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.349 
international phones and even things
like<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> iPad<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.410> iPhone<00:00:16.500> use<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.789> format

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
like the iPad an iPhone use this format

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.689 
like the iPad an iPhone use this format
it<00:00:18.900> looks<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> SIM<00:00:19.740> card<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.580> has

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
it looks like a SIM card it actually has

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.730 
it looks like a SIM card it actually has
the<00:00:20.820> same<00:00:20.970> chip<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> regular<00:00:21.990> SIM<00:00:22.230> card<00:00:22.500> but

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the same chip as a regular SIM card but

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.009 
the same chip as a regular SIM card but
it's<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.250> smaller<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> want<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> open

it's just smaller so if you want to open

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
it's just smaller so if you want to open
yourself<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> wider<00:00:26.250> variety<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.849> phones

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
yourself up to a wider variety of phones

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
yourself up to a wider variety of phones
from<00:00:27.570> overseas<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> unlock<00:00:29.640> your

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
t-mobile you'll have to get this Micro

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.220 
t-mobile you'll have to get this Micro
SIM<00:00:34.649> format<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.239> already<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.960> a

SIM format but if you already have a
regular-sized<00:00:38.040> SIM<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.270> cut<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
regular-sized SIM you can just cut it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
regular-sized SIM you can just cut it
down<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> carrier<00:00:41.489> store

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
