00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
because there's a little bit of I think

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.120

there's only a little ghost chili flakes
in<00:05:59.340> there<00:05:59.460> I<00:06:05.180> anticipated<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.420> to<00:06:06.480> be<00:06:06.660> way

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
in there I anticipated it to be way

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.110
