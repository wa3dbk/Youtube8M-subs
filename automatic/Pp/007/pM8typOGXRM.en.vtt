00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
extend it just a little bit then you'll

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.819

that's exactly half a bit
I<00:01:37.060> usually<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.630> don't<00:01:37.960> measure<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.350> just<00:01:38.680> use

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
I usually just don't measure I just use

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.740 
I usually just don't measure I just use
a<00:01:38.860> half<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.310> bag<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:40.630> be<00:01:40.780> using<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.880> corn

a half a bag will be using the corn

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.440 
a half a bag will be using the corn
syrup<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.440> you'll<00:01:45.280> be<00:01:45.460> using<00:01:45.670> one<00:01:46.120> cup<00:01:46.420> of

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450

liquid measure and not a solid measure

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.560 
liquid measure and not a solid measure
then<00:01:53.770> we'll<00:01:53.950> be<00:01:54.070> using<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.640> can<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.180> condensed

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
ingredients that will be using to make

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.420 
ingredients that will be using to make
our<00:02:02.800> caramel<00:02:03.220> corn<00:02:03.460> okay<00:02:04.800> now<00:02:05.800> we<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:06.130> all<00:02:06.369> of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
our caramel corn okay now we have all of

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.430 
our caramel corn okay now we have all of
our<00:02:06.670> ingredients<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.479> pan<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:08.259> don't

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
our ingredients in the pan you don't

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.109 
our ingredients in the pan you don't
have<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.679> put<00:02:08.800> them<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.009> one<00:02:09.160> at<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.580> time<00:02:09.880> you

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
have to put them in one at a time you

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.120 
have to put them in one at a time you
can<00:02:10.270> put<00:02:10.450> them<00:02:10.570> all<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.989> at<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> same<00:02:11.470> time<00:02:11.770> and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
can put them all in at the same time and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.310 
can put them all in at the same time and
then<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.300> come<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.840> turn<00:02:14.050> up<00:02:14.200> your

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
then you can come in and turn up your

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.680 
then you can come in and turn up your
heat<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.580> turn<00:02:15.760> my<00:02:15.820> heat<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.420> quite

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
heat I'm going to turn my heat up quite

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.540 
heat I'm going to turn my heat up quite
high<00:02:16.720> because<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> type<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.800> stove<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.489> I

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
high because the type of stove that I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.970 
high because the type of stove that I
have<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.720> need<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.290> adapt<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
have so you just need to adapt it to the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.830 
have so you just need to adapt it to the
type<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.220> stove<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.270> kind<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.570> heat

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
type of stove but you can kind of heat

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250 
type of stove but you can kind of heat
it<00:02:22.989> out<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> little<00:02:23.500> bit<00:02:23.709> at<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.450> first<00:02:25.840> until

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
it out a little bit at the first until

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.040 
it out a little bit at the first until
this<00:02:26.410> starts<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> melt<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.510> secret<00:02:28.930> of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
this starts to melt but the secret of

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.360 
this starts to melt but the secret of
this<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.239> stirred<00:02:31.570> up<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:33.340> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
this is to get a stirred up and then you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.060 
this is to get a stirred up and then you
continue<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.270> stir<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.650> very

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
continue to stir this it's very

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.340 
continue to stir this it's very
important<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.940> not<00:02:37.360> leave<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.020> while

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
important that you not leave this while

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.260 
important that you not leave this while
it<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.650> cooking<00:02:38.890> because<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.580> will<00:02:39.700> scorch<00:02:40.030> on

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
it is cooking because it will scorch on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.770 
it is cooking because it will scorch on
the<00:02:40.390> bottom<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.910> okay<00:02:42.910> I've<00:02:43.180> been<00:02:43.450> stirring

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the bottom so okay I've been stirring

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.560 
the bottom so okay I've been stirring
this<00:02:44.080> for<00:02:44.700> approximately<00:02:45.700> five<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.090> six

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
this for approximately five to six

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.990 
this for approximately five to six
minutes<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:48.010> getting<00:02:48.340> ready<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.670> come

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
minutes it's just getting ready to come

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.020 
minutes it's just getting ready to come
to<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.209> full<00:02:49.480> rolling<00:02:49.540> boil<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:51.549> I'm<00:02:51.700> stirring

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
to a full rolling boil but I'm stirring

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.820 
to a full rolling boil but I'm stirring
it<00:02:52.299> constantly<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.410> will<00:02:53.560> need<00:02:53.799> to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it constantly and you will need to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.330 
it constantly and you will need to
continue<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.790> stir<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.720> constantly<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:57.190> can

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
continue to stir it constantly you can

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.400 
continue to stir it constantly you can
just<00:02:57.549> see<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.790> starting<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.510> bubble<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.080> little

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
just see it starting to bubble a little

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.560 
just see it starting to bubble a little
bit<00:02:59.590> but<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> needs<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.790> come<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.269> full

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
bit but it needs to come to a full

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.199 
bit but it needs to come to a full
rolling<00:03:01.630> boil<00:03:02.560> before<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.250> begin<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.610> time<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
rolling boil before you begin to time it

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.900 
rolling boil before you begin to time it
for<00:03:04.239> its<00:03:04.540> five<00:03:04.810> minutes<00:03:07.890> okay<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.579> just

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
for its five minutes okay it's just

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.110 
for its five minutes okay it's just
about<00:03:10.150> there<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:11.070> rolling<00:03:12.070> boil<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.670> one<00:03:12.940> that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
about there a rolling boil is one that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.520 
about there a rolling boil is one that
you<00:03:13.150> cannot<00:03:13.750> stir<00:03:14.200> down<00:03:18.690> now<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:19.930> important

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
you cannot stir down now it's important

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.229 
you cannot stir down now it's important
here<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:20.860> when<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.280> starts<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.730> boil<00:03:22.000> that

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
here that when it starts to boil that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.289 
here that when it starts to boil that
you<00:03:22.360> cook<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:22.930> only<00:03:23.110> five<00:03:23.680> minutes<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:24.549> you

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
you cook it for only five minutes if you

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.170 
you cook it for only five minutes if you
overcook<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.290> has<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> tendency<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.549> many

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
overcook it and has a tendency like many

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.870 
overcook it and has a tendency like many
candies<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.110> go<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.320> sugar<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.579> don't

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
candies to go to sugar and you don't

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.240 
candies to go to sugar and you don't
want<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.390> turn<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.780> sugar<00:03:31.989> okay<00:03:32.950> it's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
want it to turn to sugar okay it's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.670 
want it to turn to sugar okay it's
really<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.670> rolling<00:03:34.120> boil<00:03:34.299> now<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.560> we're

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
really a rolling boil now and so we're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.440 
really a rolling boil now and so we're
going<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.860> turn<00:03:36.100> our<00:03:36.160> heat<00:03:36.489> way<00:03:36.790> down<00:03:37.060> because

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
going to turn our heat way down because

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.660 
going to turn our heat way down because
there's<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.720> start<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.230> pop<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.920> we're<00:03:39.489> going

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
there's a start to pop and we're going

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.849 
there's a start to pop and we're going
to<00:03:39.700> time<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.030> for<00:03:40.709> five<00:03:41.709> minutes

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.729 

it's<00:03:46.859> important<00:03:47.609> now<00:03:47.819> that<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.569> continue<00:03:48.900> to

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.849 

stir<00:03:53.359> I've<00:03:54.359> got<00:03:54.659> my<00:03:54.810> heat<00:03:55.079> down<00:03:57.439> but<00:03:58.439> it<00:03:58.560> still

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
stir I've got my heat down but it still

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.410 
stir I've got my heat down but it still
needs<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.400> boil<00:04:01.340> also<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.730> important<00:04:03.299> that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
needs to boil also it's important that

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.530 
needs to boil also it's important that
you<00:04:03.450> only<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.260> one<00:04:04.530> recipe<00:04:05.129> at<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> time<00:04:05.700> it's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
you only do one recipe at a time it's

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.140 
you only do one recipe at a time it's
like<00:04:06.870> candy<00:04:06.900> it's<00:04:07.739> not<00:04:08.069> good<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.400> double<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
like candy it's not good to double the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.390 
like candy it's not good to double the
recipe<00:04:11.599> I've<00:04:12.599> got<00:04:12.900> my<00:04:13.109> heat<00:04:13.349> way<00:04:13.709> down<00:04:13.980> but<00:04:14.250> it

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
recipe I've got my heat way down but it

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.370 
recipe I've got my heat way down but it
still<00:04:14.639> has<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:14.939> tendency<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.599> pump<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:16.079> my

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
still has the tendency to pump on my

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.830 
still has the tendency to pump on my
stove<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:17.940> turn<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.329> down<00:04:18.509> so<00:04:18.810> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
stove so you just turn it down so it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.439 
stove so you just turn it down so it
doesn't<00:04:19.259> pop<00:04:19.699> but<00:04:20.699> we're<00:04:20.849> going<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.090> continue

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
doesn't pop but we're going to continue

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.770 
doesn't pop but we're going to continue
to<00:04:21.660> stir<00:04:22.109> this<00:04:22.470> for<00:04:23.240> five<00:04:24.240> minutes<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.599> so

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
to stir this for five minutes this is so

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.890 
to stir this for five minutes this is so
it<00:04:27.840> will<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.110> scorch<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.190> burn<00:04:32.539> okay<00:04:33.539> this<00:04:33.750> is

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
it will not scorch and burn okay this is

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.629 
it will not scorch and burn okay this is
what<00:04:34.050> our<00:04:34.080> caramel<00:04:34.620> corn<00:04:34.830> or<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.280> karmic

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
what our caramel corn or the karmic

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.159 
what our caramel corn or the karmic
looks<00:04:35.849> like<00:04:36.060> before<00:04:36.240> we<00:04:36.419> pour<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.870> onto<00:04:36.990> our

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
looks like before we pour it onto our

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.980 
looks like before we pour it onto our
corn<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.820> has<00:04:38.970> cooked<00:04:39.240> for<00:04:39.330> only<00:04:39.599> five

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
corn and it has cooked for only five

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.230 
corn and it has cooked for only five
minutes<00:04:40.410> after<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.830> started<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.280> boil<00:04:41.550> that's

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
minutes after it started to boil that's

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.450 
minutes after it started to boil that's
important<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.500> we're<00:04:43.710> going<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.919> start<00:04:44.190> to

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
important so we're going to start to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.020 
important so we're going to start to
pour<00:04:44.820> some<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.270> on<00:04:45.720> top<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.620> our<00:04:46.860> corn<00:04:47.220> not

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
pour some of this on top of our corn not

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.969 
pour some of this on top of our corn not
everything<00:04:48.599> all<00:04:48.810> at<00:04:48.840> one<00:04:49.169> time<00:04:49.199> because<00:04:49.800> we

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
everything all at one time because we

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.390 
everything all at one time because we
want<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.250> little<00:04:50.599> opportunity<00:04:51.599> to<00:04:52.050> toss<00:04:52.289> it<00:04:52.560> now

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.300 

you<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.699> see<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.180> has<00:04:58.080> got<00:04:58.409> two<00:05:00.889> pictures<00:05:01.889> of

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
you can see this has got two pictures of

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.080 
you can see this has got two pictures of
corn<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.949> is<00:05:05.159> how<00:05:05.310> much<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.760> filled

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
corn in it and this is how much I filled

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.990 
corn in it and this is how much I filled
my<00:05:06.289> picture<00:05:07.289> this<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.070> last<00:05:08.760> two<00:05:09.539> quarts

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
my picture this is the last two quarts

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.990 
my picture this is the last two quarts
so<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.120> can<00:05:12.330> just<00:05:12.360> toss<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:16.580> helps<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.610> begin

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
so I can just toss this helps to begin

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:32.950 
so I can just toss this helps to begin
to<00:05:18.150> coat<00:05:18.389> it

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:53.890 

okay<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:35.000> little<00:05:36.000> bit<00:05:36.270> more<00:05:36.449> caramel<00:05:36.900> long

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.200 

I<00:05:53.960> think<00:05:54.919> some<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.340> tips<00:05:55.610> that<00:05:55.729> we<00:05:56.000> can

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
I think some of the tips that we can

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.740 
I think some of the tips that we can
remind<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.020> right<00:05:57.350> now<00:05:57.560> is<00:05:57.919> that<00:05:58.750> you

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
remind you of right now is that you

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.749 
remind you of right now is that you
bring<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.139> once<00:06:00.410> you<00:06:00.560> bring<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:00.889> a<00:06:01.070> boil<00:06:01.430> you

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
bring it once you bring it to a boil you

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.120 
bring it once you bring it to a boil you
only<00:06:01.940> cook<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.360> for<00:06:02.539> 5<00:06:02.750> minutes<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.979> is

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
only cook it for 5 minutes and it is

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.860 
only cook it for 5 minutes and it is
important<00:06:04.729> to<00:06:04.880> stir<00:06:05.180> up<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.330> entire<00:06:05.810> time

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
important to stir up the entire time

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.310 
important to stir up the entire time
that<00:06:06.259> it<00:06:06.590> is<00:06:06.710> cooking<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:08.660> way<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.199> it
