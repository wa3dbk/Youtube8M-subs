00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
so Hanna's blush in the series isn't

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.680 
so Hanna's blush in the series isn't
very<00:03:44.220> noticeable<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.880> very<00:03:45.060> dramatic<00:03:45.239> at<00:03:45.660> all

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
so this is why a cream blush is perfect

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.610

size so now I'm doing is working from

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.770 
size so now I'm doing is working from
the<00:04:52.370> back<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.820> front<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.270> I'm<00:04:53.630> going<00:04:53.750> to

the back to the front and I'm going to

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.330 
the back to the front and I'm going to
take<00:04:53.960> each<00:04:54.170> section<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.710> hair<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.190> I'm<00:04:55.310> going

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
to begin curling it now how I curl my

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.650 
to begin curling it now how I curl my
hair<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.860> start<00:04:58.130> about<00:04:58.430> halfway<00:04:58.940> down<00:04:59.360> and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
hair is I start about halfway down and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.480 
hair is I start about halfway down and
then<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.050> begin<00:05:00.380> curling<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:00.980> I<00:05:01.010> don't<00:05:01.190> go<00:05:01.280> all

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
then I begin curling so I don't go all

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.010 
then I begin curling so I don't go all
the<00:05:01.610> way<00:05:01.640> down<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.030> hair<00:05:02.180> piece<00:05:02.420> I<00:05:02.690> start

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
the way down the hair piece I start

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.990 
the way down the hair piece I start
about<00:05:03.320> halfway<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:04.070> then<00:05:04.130> work<00:05:04.670> the<00:05:04.820> hair

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
about halfway and then work the hair

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.670 
about halfway and then work the hair
through<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.270> curl<00:05:05.540> now<00:05:06.290> I'm<00:05:06.350> going<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.560> show

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
through the curl now I'm going to show

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.650 
through the curl now I'm going to show
you<00:05:06.710> again<00:05:07.010> in<00:05:07.190> real<00:05:07.400> time<00:05:07.640> motion<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:08.390> all<00:05:08.540> I'm

going to do is take the clamp and clamp

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.980 
going to do is take the clamp and clamp
it<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:10.760> then<00:05:10.850> I'm<00:05:11.180> going<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.390> begin<00:05:11.510> turning

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
it and then I'm going to begin turning

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.440 
it and then I'm going to begin turning
half<00:05:12.380> way<00:05:12.620> down<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.160> then<00:05:13.640> release<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.180> clamp

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
half way down and then release the clamp

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.210 
half way down and then release the clamp
and<00:05:14.660> work<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.110> rest<00:05:15.290> of<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.590> hair<00:05:15.830> through

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
and work the rest of the hair through

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.830 
and work the rest of the hair through
this<00:05:16.850> is<00:05:17.000> just<00:05:17.150> going<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.330> give<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.570> curl

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
this is just going to give you a curl

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.330 
this is just going to give you a curl
that<00:05:18.020> is<00:05:18.140> curled<00:05:18.380> all<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.740> way<00:05:18.830> up<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.130> hair

that is curled all the way up the hair

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.040 
that is curled all the way up the hair
piece<00:05:19.490> instead<00:05:20.030> of<00:05:20.150> just<00:05:20.360> at<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.600> ends<00:05:20.900> which

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
piece instead of just at the ends which

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.540 
piece instead of just at the ends which
is<00:05:21.200> what<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.500> want<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:21.890> achieve<00:05:22.010> Hannah's

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
look now how I'm curling each section of

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.180 
look now how I'm curling each section of
hair<00:05:26.600> is<00:05:26.780> I'm<00:05:26.900> curling<00:05:27.260> them<00:05:27.410> every<00:05:27.740> other<00:05:27.890> way

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
hair is I'm curling them every other way

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.640 
hair is I'm curling them every other way
so<00:05:28.760> one<00:05:29.030> way<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.240> will<00:05:29.570> do<00:05:29.750> away<00:05:29.990> from<00:05:30.350> my<00:05:30.470> face

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
so one way I will do away from my face

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.260 
so one way I will do away from my face
and<00:05:30.890> then<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.220> other<00:05:31.340> piece<00:05:31.640> of<00:05:31.670> hair<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.000> will

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
and then the other piece of hair I will

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.150 
and then the other piece of hair I will
do<00:05:32.390> towards<00:05:32.720> my<00:05:32.870> face<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.620> is<00:05:33.680> just<00:05:33.980> going<00:05:34.070> to

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
do towards my face this is just going to

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.500 
do towards my face this is just going to
prevent<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.550> curls<00:05:34.790> from<00:05:34.940> sticking<00:05:35.240> together

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
prevent the curls from sticking together

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.910 
prevent the curls from sticking together
and<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.960> will<00:05:36.020> give<00:05:36.170> you<00:05:36.230> kind<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.650> messy

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920

vibe that hannah has so you don't want

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.300 
vibe that hannah has so you don't want
your<00:05:39.020> curls<00:05:39.200> to<00:05:39.380> stick<00:05:39.590> together<00:05:39.740> at<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.160> end

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
your curls to stick together at the end

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.860 
your curls to stick together at the end
and<00:05:40.610> by<00:05:40.790> curling<00:05:41.210> them<00:05:41.330> all<00:05:41.510> in<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.720> same

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
and by curling them all in the same

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.960 
and by curling them all in the same
direction<00:05:42.050> you'll<00:05:42.860> kind<00:05:43.040> of<00:05:43.130> eventually

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
direction you'll kind of eventually

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.820 
direction you'll kind of eventually
start<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.600> form<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:45.050> way<00:05:45.200> so<00:05:45.440> that's<00:05:45.620> why<00:05:45.770> you

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
start to form that way so that's why you

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.710 
start to form that way so that's why you
want<00:05:46.070> to<00:05:46.160> do<00:05:46.280> every<00:05:46.610> other<00:05:46.730> way<00:05:46.970> but<00:05:47.510> make<00:05:47.690> sure

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
want to do every other way but make sure

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.230 
want to do every other way but make sure
you<00:05:48.020> curl<00:05:48.260> your<00:05:48.320> hair<00:05:48.700> away<00:05:49.700> from<00:05:49.910> your<00:05:50.090> face

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
once you get to the pieces that are

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.710 
once you get to the pieces that are
closest<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.700> your<00:05:52.820> face<00:05:52.880> it'll<00:05:53.390> be<00:05:53.480> able<00:05:53.570> to
