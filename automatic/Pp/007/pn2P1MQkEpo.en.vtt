00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.850
 high performance 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.890
 other times you look towards the athletes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.049
 paralympics that day by day prepare 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.719
 with twice the effort due to their 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.789
 limitations in the body but with the 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.610
 heart full of struggle and surrender 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.250
 in the last london olympics 2012 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500
 the Mexican Paralympic athletes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.960
 they put mexico in 23rd place 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.479
 Medal standings were not given the same 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.399
 media coverage but that did not stop 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.909
 that every medal won by a Mexican 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.369
 the effort will reach the world's ears 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.080
 dedication the faith and constancy are 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.630
 stories that are repeated in these 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.060
 star athletes an example is rené 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.369
 ledesma that at 16 years suffered a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.890
 accident acquiring a disability 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.890
 in a town in Veracruz where he lived 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.700
 talk 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.520
 or so he talks but very little it cost me 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.160
 a lot of work was not going to happen 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.470
 locked up and because of the lack of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.130
 movement because the thing in my body is 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.130
 it was complicating 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.700
 I had a bad rehabilitation and my body 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.250
 it was with fracturing then we go 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.800
 to work here mimes perform them in 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.140
 Merida his life of a 180 degree turn 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.900
 when entering the clip where he returned to 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.330
 be born achieving goals in less time 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.150
 and good rehabilitation that not only 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.400
 they were physical but emotional and the no 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.560
 be able to walk christmas broke the heart 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 after situations for wanting to 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.400
 believe that 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.900
 many times was wheelchair 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.900
 a limitation 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.690
 As I tell you, the rehabilitation 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.590
 It was also an emotional zigzag to believe 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.819
 in me to realize that after 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.950
 vouchers like four naval like to be 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.050
 human and that the city see - owner the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.390
 transportation to the shoes to stop 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.670
 any conventional 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.769
 ledezma participated in guanajuato 2012 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.519
 winning silver in the 50 meters back 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.799
 categories 19 21 years now it is 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.200

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:31.660

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.660
 Mexico from October 22 to 26 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.390
 for sport to get ahead 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.680
 despite that obscure disability that 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.680
 he has simply left us 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.530
 and that is a sample of what he can 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.970
 do 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.970
 what he has so that many parents 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.750
 every morning and night at 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.360

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.550

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.160

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.910
 made and designed for a person 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.150
 specific and depending on your 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.150
 disability 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.440
 and special 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.669
 René and his family feel very 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.830
 grateful to the Yucatecans for the 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.689
 kindness to feel that here in Merida 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.639
 there are angels and that's why they have 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.639
 self-styled you carochos 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.539

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.560
 considered by his coach 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:47.880
 Swimming as the new Mexican talent 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.880
 meaning yes I think 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.490
 surrender to the oppressor 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.210
 breathe and take it out 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.580
