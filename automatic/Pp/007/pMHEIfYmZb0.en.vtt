for a hard drive and actually two hard

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.089 
for a hard drive and actually two hard
drives<00:00:08.880> inside<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> computer<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.710> doesn't

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
drives inside a computer that doesn't

have<00:00:11.340> any<00:00:11.610> more<00:00:11.790> space<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.830> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.009> build

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
have any more space I'm going to build

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.150 
have any more space I'm going to build
some<00:00:15.570> brackets<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.710> thought<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.039> would

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
some brackets and I thought it would

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.429 
some brackets and I thought it would
show<00:00:18.109> some<00:00:19.109> other<00:00:19.529> people<00:00:19.920> how<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.609> did<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.439> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
show some other people how I did it you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
show some other people how I did it you
could<00:00:22.560> take<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> but

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
could take it for what it is but

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.740 
could take it for what it is but
hopefully<00:00:24.960> it'll<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:26.070> cheap<00:00:26.400> very

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750

the<00:01:39.479> basic<00:01:39.869> concept<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.619> gonna<00:01:40.770> use<00:01:41.720> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the basic concept that I'm gonna use can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
the basic concept that I'm gonna use can
be<00:01:42.750> described<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> pair<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> bunk<00:01:44.579> beds

be described like a pair of bunk beds

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.899 
be described like a pair of bunk beds
we're<00:01:45.659> gonna<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:46.049> four<00:01:46.320> brackets<00:01:46.670> gonna<00:01:47.670> cut

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
we're gonna take four brackets gonna cut

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.410 
we're gonna take four brackets gonna cut
them<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:49.280> I'm<00:01:50.280> gonna<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:50.970> hard<00:01:51.240> drives

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
them and I'm gonna do two hard drives

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.139 
them and I'm gonna do two hard drives
for<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.649> situation<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.729> obviously<00:01:54.030> use

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
for my situation you can obviously use

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.350 
for my situation you can obviously use
more<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> space<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
more we're going to space them out for

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.609 
more we're going to space them out for
airflow<00:01:59.930> cutting<00:02:00.930> these<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.229> pretty<00:02:01.380> easy

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
airflow cutting these are pretty easy

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.789 
airflow cutting these are pretty easy
use<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.130> hacksaw<00:02:02.399> our<00:02:02.729> tin<00:02:03.659> snips<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.290> adrenalin

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
use a hacksaw our tin snips or adrenalin

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
use a hacksaw our tin snips or adrenalin
tool<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.820> don't<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> cut<00:02:06.390> them

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
tool you don't have to cut them

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.900 
tool you don't have to cut them
perfectly<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> cut<00:02:08.190> them<00:02:08.369> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
perfectly but you do want to cut them so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
perfectly but you do want to cut them so
that<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> same<00:02:10.110> number<00:02:10.470> slots

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that you have like the same number slots

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.729 
that you have like the same number slots
here<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.550> line<00:02:11.730> them<00:02:11.849> up

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
here so you can line them up

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.670 
here so you can line them up
pretty<00:02:13.739> easily<00:02:14.329> cut<00:02:15.329> these<00:02:15.480> uh<00:02:15.680> whatever

part<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:57.080> see<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:58.150> bunk<00:02:59.150> bed

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
part of it you can see the bunk bed

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.040 
part of it you can see the bunk bed
style<00:03:00.349> design<00:03:00.760> looks<00:03:01.760> pretty<00:03:02.060> easy<00:03:02.209> screws

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
style design looks pretty easy screws

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.839 
style design looks pretty easy screws
this<00:03:03.170> one<00:03:03.410> right<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.769> here<00:03:03.920> thankfully<00:03:04.519> these

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
this one right in here thankfully these

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.850 
this one right in here thankfully these
screws<00:03:05.239> went<00:03:06.080> right<00:03:06.230> through<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.470> slots

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
screws went right through the slots

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.589 
screws went right through the slots
without<00:03:07.220> having<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.849> drill<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.300> slots

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
without having to drill the slots

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.630 
without having to drill the slots
anymore<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.200> make<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.470> hole<00:03:09.620> bigger<00:03:09.860> which<00:03:10.610> is

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
anymore to make the hole bigger which is

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.990 
anymore to make the hole bigger which is
a<00:03:10.790> nice<00:03:11.420> added<00:03:11.660> bonus<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:13.400> there<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:13.819> go

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.690 

alright<00:03:17.920> now<00:03:18.920> how<00:03:19.099> we're<00:03:19.280> actually<00:03:19.459> gonna

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
alright now how we're actually gonna

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.520 
alright now how we're actually gonna
attach<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.390> computer<00:03:20.780> case<00:03:20.989> is<00:03:21.230> using

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
attach it to the computer case is using

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.680 
attach it to the computer case is using

preferred hardware store that sells
stuff<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:31.180> now<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.780> other<00:03:32.930> reason<00:03:33.260> why<00:03:33.349> I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
stuff is now the the other reason why I

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.309 
stuff is now the the other reason why I
like<00:03:33.590> using<00:03:33.860> these<00:03:34.840> which<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.989> actually<00:03:36.290> only

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
like using these which is actually only

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.750 
like using these which is actually only
one<00:03:36.500> other<00:03:36.799> project<00:03:37.069> that<00:03:37.280> I've<00:03:37.459> done<00:03:37.610> with

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
one other project that I've done with

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.509 
one other project that I've done with
these<00:03:37.940> is<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.720> these<00:03:39.500> brackets<00:03:39.950> here<00:03:40.160> fit

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
these is that these brackets here fit

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.720 
these is that these brackets here fit
right<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.940> little<00:03:41.090> channel<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.579> get

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
right in the little channel and you get

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.420 
right in the little channel and you get
a<00:03:43.760> little<00:03:44.030> nut<00:03:44.329> in<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.599> little<00:03:44.870> bolt<00:03:45.079> set<00:03:45.430> and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
a little nut in a little bolt set and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.979 
a little nut in a little bolt set and
you<00:03:47.060> can<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.299> stick<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.540> right<00:03:47.569> in<00:03:47.810> there

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
you can just stick it right in there

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.600 
you can just stick it right in there
which<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.349> another<00:03:48.590> reason<00:03:48.950> why<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.099> said<00:03:49.310> it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
which is another reason why I said it

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.369 
which is another reason why I said it
didn't<00:03:49.879> matter<00:03:49.970> how<00:03:50.299> exact<00:03:50.750> we<00:03:50.959> cut<00:03:51.170> these

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
didn't matter how exact we cut these

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.680 
didn't matter how exact we cut these
because<00:03:52.310> since<00:03:52.819> these<00:03:53.000> are<00:03:53.150> gonna<00:03:53.239> match<00:03:53.450> up

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
because since these are gonna match up

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.190 
because since these are gonna match up
the<00:03:53.810> poles<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:55.040> will<00:03:55.310> level<00:03:55.640> us<00:03:55.910> out<00:03:56.200> pretty

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
the poles that will level us out pretty

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.740 
the poles that will level us out pretty
perfectly<00:03:57.650> even<00:03:58.040> even<00:03:58.700> though<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.660> in

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
perfectly even even though that that in

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.069 
perfectly even even though that that in
itself<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.230> not<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:00.440> important<00:04:01.810> but<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.930> can

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
itself is not that important but you can

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.710 
itself is not that important but you can
get<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.319> idea<00:04:03.350> here<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:05.269> can<00:04:05.389> stick<00:04:05.600> the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
get the idea here you can stick the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.030 
get the idea here you can stick the
bolts<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.139> we<00:04:06.290> can<00:04:06.410> even<00:04:06.560> do<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.680> little<00:04:06.889> bit

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
bolts and we can even do a little bit

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.440 
bolts and we can even do a little bit
more<00:04:07.069> trimming<00:04:07.519> if<00:04:07.760> we<00:04:07.880> need<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.150> make<00:04:08.329> this

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
more trimming if we need to make this

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.990 
more trimming if we need to make this
shorter<00:04:09.099> again<00:04:10.099> with<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> dremel<00:04:10.819> or<00:04:10.940> a

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
shorter again with the dremel or a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.789 
shorter again with the dremel or a
hacksaw<00:04:11.450> whatever<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:11.870> easiest<00:04:12.230> for<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.590> and

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
hacksaw whatever is easiest for you and

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.690 
hacksaw whatever is easiest for you and
then<00:04:14.410> all<00:04:15.410> in<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.739> bottom<00:04:16.010> go<00:04:16.340> onto<00:04:16.579> the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
then all in the bottom go onto the

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.670 
then all in the bottom go onto the
computer<00:04:17.030> case<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:18.079> can<00:04:18.229> do<00:04:18.349> it<00:04:18.440> on<00:04:18.560> both

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
computer case you can do it on both

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.890 
computer case you can do it on both
sides<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.090> kind<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.450> design<00:04:20.720> if<00:04:20.870> you

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
sides with this kind of design if you

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.810 
sides with this kind of design if you
wanted<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.530> which<00:04:22.099> would<00:04:22.280> be<00:04:22.430> really<00:04:22.669> nice

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
wanted to which would be really nice

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.060 
wanted to which would be really nice
because<00:04:23.120> then<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:24.139> could<00:04:24.289> take<00:04:24.500> out<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.889> hard

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
because then you could take out the hard

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.510 
because then you could take out the hard
drives<00:04:25.370> oh<00:04:26.620> there<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:27.710> go<00:04:27.740> then<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.370> could

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
drives oh there we go then you could

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.690 
drives oh there we go then you could
take<00:04:28.610> out<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.880> hard<00:04:29.060> drives<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:30.520> you're<00:04:31.520> not

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
take out the hard drives and you're not

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.400 
take out the hard drives and you're not
going<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.940> change<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.570> spacing<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:33.229> these

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
going to change the spacing of these

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.690 
going to change the spacing of these
guys<00:04:33.650> because<00:04:33.950> right<00:04:34.190> now<00:04:34.370> what<00:04:34.520> we're

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
guys because right now what we're

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.820 
guys because right now what we're
actually<00:04:34.849> doing<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.870> using<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.349> hard<00:04:36.560> drives

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
actually doing is using the hard drives

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.950 
actually doing is using the hard drives
themselves<00:04:37.099> to<00:04:38.030> help<00:04:38.240> make<00:04:38.450> this<00:04:38.630> structure

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
themselves to help make this structure

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.129 
themselves to help make this structure
stable<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:40.550> can<00:04:40.610> see<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.690> even<00:04:41.840> though<00:04:41.990> we

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
stable you can see that even though we

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.450

drop it right in there and we've got

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.190 
drop it right in there and we've got
plenty<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:54.020> space<00:04:55.090> like<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.240> said<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.810> top<00:04:57.020> of

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
plenty of space like I said the top of

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.690 
plenty of space like I said the top of
mine<00:04:57.410> comes<00:04:57.680> on<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:57.979> off<00:04:58.099> which<00:04:58.340> is<00:04:58.490> why<00:04:58.669> I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
mine comes on and off which is why I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.760 
mine comes on and off which is why I
wouldn't<00:04:58.940> really<00:04:59.330> mounted<00:04:59.810> there<00:04:59.990> but<00:05:00.530> I

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
wouldn't really mounted there but I

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.740 
wouldn't really mounted there but I
could<00:05:01.039> if<00:05:01.219> you<00:05:01.310> see<00:05:01.490> over<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:01.969> I<00:05:02.090> couldn't

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
mount it to here I could mount it if I

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.460 
mount it to here I could mount it if I
turned<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.780> around

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
turned it around

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.380 
turned it around
I<00:05:08.080> could<00:05:09.080> mount<00:05:09.230> to<00:05:09.380> do<00:05:09.560> there<00:05:09.910> there's<00:05:10.910> lots

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
I could mount to do there there's lots

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
pretty nice once you started making

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.340 
pretty nice once you started making
these<00:05:14.210> little<00:05:14.270> brackets<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.080> getting<00:05:15.290> those

these little brackets and getting those

these little brackets and getting those
little<00:05:15.650> L<00:05:15.770> brackets<00:05:16.310> because<00:05:16.820> it<00:05:17.000> gives<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.240> a

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
little L brackets because it gives you a

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
little L brackets because it gives you a
lot<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.480> ideas<00:05:17.870> of<00:05:18.290> how<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.530> do<00:05:18.710> other<00:05:18.860> things

just kind of stays up here on top of my
entertainment<00:05:41.030> center<00:05:42.250> so<00:05:43.250> that's<00:05:43.370> where
