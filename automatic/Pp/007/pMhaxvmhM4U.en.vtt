is<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:46.440> even<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.799> realized<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.940> star<00:03:48.239> of

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
is but even I realized that the star of

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.300 
is but even I realized that the star of
that<00:03:48.449> match<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:48.989> sorrow<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.099> also

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
that match was sorrow but I also

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.890 
that match was sorrow but I also
understand<00:03:50.909> that<00:03:50.970> Cena<00:03:51.359> stood<00:03:51.659> toe-to-toe

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
move for move with Cesaro even though

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.240 
move for move with Cesaro even though
Cesaro<00:03:54.629> perhaps<00:03:55.139> is<00:03:55.319> stronger<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.859> much

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
Cesaro perhaps is stronger and much

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.879 
Cesaro perhaps is stronger and much
