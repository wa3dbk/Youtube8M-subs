00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
sort of took away the need for a small

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.680 
sort of took away the need for a small
pack<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.730> that's<00:02:22.880> kind<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.299> what<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> was

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
pack and that's kind of what I was

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.440 
pack and that's kind of what I was
looking<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.730> when<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.850> carried<00:02:26.330> a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
looking for because when I carried a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.350 
looking for because when I carried a
small<00:02:26.930> pack<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.680> always<00:02:27.830> seemed<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.360> it

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
small pack it always seemed that it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.120 
small pack it always seemed that it
wasn't<00:02:29.900> full<00:02:30.290> enough<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.310> justify<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
wasn't full enough to really justify the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.430 
wasn't full enough to really justify the
amount<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.519> space<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.540> were<00:02:36.080> carrying

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
amount of space that you were carrying

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.490 
amount of space that you were carrying
with<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.640> fixed<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.750> right<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
with you but this fixed it right up and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.860 
with you but this fixed it right up and
I<00:02:39.920> find<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.580> be<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:41.390> really<00:02:41.420> useful

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
I find it to be a really really useful
