00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:16.129
 At the same time, they wanted to adapt easily and quickly 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.660
 In May, the corporations had people today, I have become an overseas 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.310
 continue with 29 points 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.199
 What makes a sign its own behavior around this topic? 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.590
 Not these of them are quite easy to change was the system 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.260
 used these are for example programs 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.600
 or yes icons like the trash your hard drives 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 Programs folder 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.390
 or certain folders like those look 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 just special and symbols of the systems of Mac OS x already so 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.309
 are predetermined and who for variety on the Meckes or always 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.440
 wants to have cleaned up or the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.720
 Of course, the program wants to adapt its style or to its taste 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.090
 optimal especially everything for free 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 and just as and yes he does not like to say he feels 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.390
 wonderful its purpose 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.680
 I'll show you the program now for a short time an overview it looks like 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.450
 not easy 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.740
 there is only the Kathi only in general then that is so yes 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.479
 Symbols for burn out throw programs music player 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.949
 ZR at Outlaw are of course all folders 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.470
 such as a lot of burning program folder users like me daily could 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.170
 he can see everything himself a device can 4 yes the symbols such as 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.439
 Example of hard disks change where you can 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.090
 yes, change the main fashion here in the dock, such as the trash 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.310
 or the fine one 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.190
 and there are others still different to Eike Lenz he will change 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:43.830
 can 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.430
 of course he could change your own pictures for that, too 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.130
 use 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.329
 but if you ask now where he has such cool icons or oak trees or mac r 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.840
 I have a tip for you 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.080
 Dittmar on the viruses Sartre comes then there is a very large selection 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.630
 even if the animal at first glance does not look like it does for Mac 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 that's because it once appeals to a very large mass and it's there 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.259
 For example, he gives all kinds of delicate enemies 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.670
 he should be starting off quite a lot 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.849
 Michel, for example, to find finer and there you can then 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.029
 choose one 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.949
 Wieninger, for example, this year I've already downloaded it 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.329
 you could just click on the download and the whole thing will be in 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 Downloaded several formats as simple as that 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.389
 you have already deliberately chosen and know what you want to change me 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.129
 have restarted the council in fine again at the game is now 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.310
 I also just reset it to the program 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.590
 and I'm in the category docks now change like the fine Eichin first and 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.429
 I have downloaded little in folders 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:45.939
 the eaters and so began what I want from the ng and own part 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.079
 works both 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.530
 I just put this on top of it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.900
 and here you can already see a preview and that means not yet 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.620
 it was changed you have to take over the same but I also click 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.819
 is still feasible "I get the icon from the trash bin by placing two IP NDR part 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.879
 Sonja Leuermann used both 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.179
 and once upon a time mind then what ever on paper head empty 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.840
 and of course immediately full 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 can she do it all the way out now there are still changes to take 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.889
 it will take over the whole thing so far but I have to find the a and the 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.239
 Restart dock so that the change can really be seen still 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.219
 Locations with 9 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.109
 It can sometimes be that the change is not immediately apparent 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.569
 Reding all over with Norman must reboot before the word shows up but 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.669
 that is not the case now. "We see them specifically in changed orders 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.730
 and then you like it a bit better 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.620
 that was the program that made it easier and clearer like her 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.519
 It also works 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.819
 look at the blog entry from Rieneck go the link is one 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.680
 Description as well as for Twitter 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.510
 decent soon comes back new videos is now jumping cars and so on 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.510
 but do not forget me and this for the next time 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.899
 The schools 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.899
 Bender 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.460
