although<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.930> edited<00:02:27.560> off<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.580> put<00:02:28.760> it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
although I edited off it and put it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.930 
although I edited off it and put it
together<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.720> know<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:31.160> whatever<00:02:31.430> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.789 
together and you know but whatever a
spawner<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.870> didn't<00:02:33.080> see<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> same

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
spawner if you didn't see that same

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.759 
spawner if you didn't see that same
chest<00:02:35.350> hmm<00:02:36.350> what<00:02:36.650> else<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:39.290> can<00:02:39.410> see<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
chest hmm what else you can see the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.770 
chest hmm what else you can see the
diamond<00:02:40.130> blocks<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.730> roblox<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.510> blocks

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.219 
but so yeah um other than that I'm
pretty<00:05:30.000> sure<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.419> sounds<00:05:30.780> are<00:05:30.840> all<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:30.990> same

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
pretty sure the sounds are all the same

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.920 
pretty sure the sounds are all the same
if<00:05:31.560> unless<00:05:32.039> I<00:05:32.220> go<00:05:32.370> into<00:05:32.490> game<00:05:32.910> mode<00:05:33.830> s<00:05:35.630> it's<00:05:36.630> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
if unless I go into game mode s it's the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.050 
if unless I go into game mode s it's the
Alpha<00:05:37.229> sounds<00:05:37.590> like<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.889> bone<00:05:38.539> smashing<00:05:39.539> ones

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
Alpha sounds like the bone smashing ones

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.980 
Alpha sounds like the bone smashing ones
yeah<00:05:42.060> so<00:05:42.889> you<00:05:43.889> get<00:05:44.099> it<00:05:44.479> let<00:05:45.479> me<00:05:45.539> just<00:05:45.720> throw<00:05:45.870> an

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
yeah so you get it let me just throw an

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.620 
yeah so you get it let me just throw an
enchantment<00:05:46.530> on<00:05:46.680> this<00:05:46.919> sword<00:05:47.280> real<00:05:47.460> quick<00:05:47.729> so

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
enchantment on this sword real quick so

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.430 
enchantment on this sword real quick so
I<00:05:48.690> could<00:05:48.870> show<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:49.199> guys<00:05:50.870> particles<00:05:51.870> turn

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
I could show you guys particles turn

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.240 
I could show you guys particles turn
this<00:05:52.650> too<00:05:53.039> easy<00:05:54.710> spawning<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.979> zombie<00:05:57.349> time<00:05:58.349> set

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
this too easy spawning a zombie time set

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.980 
this too easy spawning a zombie time set
I<00:05:59.639> think<00:06:00.449> that's<00:06:00.659> it<00:06:00.930> yeah<00:06:02.570> just<00:06:03.570> go<00:06:03.780> back<00:06:03.960> to

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
I think that's it yeah just go back to

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.270 
I think that's it yeah just go back to
game<00:06:04.289> mode<00:06:04.500> s<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:05.490> spawn<00:06:06.210> one<00:06:06.419> in<00:06:07.010> so<00:06:08.010> this<00:06:08.250> is

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
game mode s and spawn one in so this is

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.180 
game mode s and spawn one in so this is
enchantment<00:06:09.000> particles<00:06:09.599> it's<00:06:09.990> like<00:06:10.289> blue<00:06:10.860> I

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
enchantment particles it's like blue I

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.060 
enchantment particles it's like blue I
took<00:06:11.789> on<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.900> format<00:06:13.409> and<00:06:13.590> just<00:06:13.710> change<00:06:13.949> the

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
took on the format and just change the

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.170 
took on the format and just change the
colors<00:06:14.400> in<00:06:15.000> my<00:06:15.060> editing<00:06:15.900> program<00:06:16.349> and<00:06:17.180> it's

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
colors in my editing program and it's

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.010 
colors in my editing program and it's
like<00:06:18.389> it's<00:06:18.870> all<00:06:19.199> dark<00:06:19.650> blue<00:06:20.010> for<00:06:20.430> these<00:06:20.580> and

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020
