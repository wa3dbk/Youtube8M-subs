00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello friends I am your dear friend 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 Fabricio aka the god of hostility 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:19.080
 and rider of alcohol and huawei 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 that 's all, but I also say there's 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.630
 be something for the community no more than 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.259
 nothing our precious community my 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.259
 pretty people 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.890
 this good this day I bring you a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.690
 tutorial on how to change lanes 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 this good is born of a concern that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.420
 I realized that very many know for 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.649
 What are the little pieces of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.340
 back is not sexist but I have 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.730
 noticed that 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:58.280
 as with frost let's say it was measured 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.510
 the signal is I'm not sexist like that is 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.980
 more recurrent then sorry for me 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.270
 everything if they look for me bag but this is 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.939
 also mother of sick animal fart 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.970
 so I think today we have the 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:17.600
 perfect scenario to demonstrate 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.720
 that if you can then know the past 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.540
 1 of this tutorial 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.430
 first I can talk here is this 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.090
 lever you always see all the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.179
 mornings 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.049
 is the address to the bastard or 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.429
 cabrona or cabroncito then in this 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.560
 case I am to the left no longer 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.409
 I could be left by more than my whore 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.049
 mother I want to do it on the left 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.619
 then I go to the right going on 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.000
 good one is to move the lever towards 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.150
 above this indicates that I'm going to the right 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.370
 very nice then 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.020
 at point number 2 step 2 rather 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.620
 is to check the truth in the mirror 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.950
 yes 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.049
 there is like cancer then 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.530
 people are half hostile right now 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:16.370
 the traffic I'm looking for a soul of 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.370
 love and friends to let me pass 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.660
 how are these beautiful ladies of your pontiac 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.340
 Gray 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.970
 and then 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.080
 we are already on the other side then third 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.790
 and last step is to remove flechita 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.600
 because if you do not confuse our friends 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.600
 drivers 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.700
 ended up fighting whores with any 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.480
 son of a neighbor then it is not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.460
 cool because it exists is to live 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.860
 to live happily in recent years that 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.720
 it remains for mankind to see what is in 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.720

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.280
