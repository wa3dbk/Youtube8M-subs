00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.479
 here for example it comes out in jumps 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.510
 I have no idea what this is about 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.680
 we'll see 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.759
 or oatmeal and after jumping and that's the way 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.420
 progressively now we go for the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.420
 fifth place that is 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.190
 it be good 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.360
 in general those that we think so much the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.860
 indigenous mammal printed from a 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.860
 a little small 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.680
 we wait for them to carry 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.190
 here we are with them today 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.050
 ultramillionaire cooking hac 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.410
 the version could also be updated 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.410
 it does not stop 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:14.400
 well this is about this is about 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.580
 bathe for richard of water there all the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.210
 day 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 swallow 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.540
 You'll commit, you bastard damn fagot, I did not have 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.840
 some giants, even two balls and two balls 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.470
 or if two golazos and I will not work a 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.530
 support for support 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.850
 it's about high taxation is I 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.050
 basically the only thing I do is give it 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.870
 positions 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.349
 and this is all right 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.340
 and apart from this pot it is about being 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.800
 playing little games for your team 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.440
 the old guys are not so much that it's a 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.640
 letter to one thing this game that the 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.790
 Most eyes are copied 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:02.170
 this copy this drive 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.700
 is the echo that there is cycling racing and what 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.840
 only that I do not like that I'm copying 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.599
 the more games that come out more 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:18.480
 Ladybugs and eat gameplay and more 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:18.480
 bored but the application of the good 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.600
 and in fourth place we have here clean 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.010
 tracing 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.720
 is the most famous of all the necessary 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.610
 when it came out two had this game 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.610
 there were no people who did not have it 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.460
 but far 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.740
 there goes your character at full speed 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 and there I go and here besides money 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.530
 now we go for it 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.250

 although people stopped her from playing 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.240

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.860

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.560
