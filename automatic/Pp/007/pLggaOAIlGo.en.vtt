and put it back to the regular review

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.590 
and put it back to the regular review
but<00:02:34.470> that's<00:02:34.650> very<00:02:34.709> interesting<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.700> like

I said before this is the stuff that you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.870 
I said before this is the stuff that you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
see in the Korean pro circuits so I can

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.160 
see in the Korean pro circuits so I can
look<00:02:42.000> up<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.510> see<00:02:42.780> both<00:02:42.959> their

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.680 
look up here I can see both their
resources<00:02:43.590> compare<00:02:44.070> them<00:02:44.250> Marie<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.239> for

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
days looks like that marine was going to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.699 
days looks like that marine was going to
take<00:02:47.610> care<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.120> probe<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.350> no<00:02:49.560> more

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709

for these guys stalkers

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.630 
for these guys stalkers
now<00:04:05.440> what<00:04:06.440> allows<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:06.920> make<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.190> Templars

now what allows you to make the Templars

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.630 
now what allows you to make the Templars
is<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.390> temple<00:04:08.660> archives<00:04:09.020> which<00:04:09.709> before<00:04:10.459> you

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
is the temple archives which before you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.309 
is the temple archives which before you
know<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:11.470> lets<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.620> make<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.550> arm<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:15.080> dark

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
know that lets you make the arm the dark

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.039 
know that lets you make the arm the dark
templars<00:04:15.800> and<00:04:16.269> now<00:04:17.269> it's<00:04:17.600> just<00:04:17.840> regular

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
templars and now it's just regular

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.650 
templars and now it's just regular
templars<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.799> then<00:04:19.340> for<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.090> dark<00:04:20.269> templars

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
templars and then for the dark templars

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.470 
templars and then for the dark templars
you<00:04:20.810> need<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.049> dark<00:04:21.230> shrine<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.760> it's<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:23.330> a

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
you need the dark shrine so it's it's a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.350 
you need the dark shrine so it's it's a
little<00:04:23.720> bit<00:04:23.840> different<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.710> setup<00:04:25.070> but<00:04:25.700> I'm

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
little bit different the setup but I'm

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.750 
little bit different the setup but I'm
digging<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.889> factory<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.520> now<00:04:28.700> for

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
digging it and a factory out now for

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.590 
digging it and a factory out now for
days<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.630> days<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:30.830> days<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:32.060> probably<00:04:32.510> a

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
days and days and days is probably a

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.270 
days and days and days is probably a
typical<00:04:33.050> move<00:04:33.380> we're<00:04:33.560> seeing<00:04:33.740> here<00:04:33.889> is<00:04:33.950> to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
typical move we're seeing here is to

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.010 
typical move we're seeing here is to
move<00:04:34.460> this<00:04:34.639> barracks<00:04:35.060> out<00:04:35.240> set<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.870> up

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
move this barracks out set it up

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.450 
move this barracks out set it up
somewhere<00:04:36.230> else<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:37.190> put<00:04:37.430> another

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
somewhere else and then put another

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.460 
somewhere else and then put another
supply<00:04:38.240> depot<00:04:38.510> here<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> still<00:04:39.320> have

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
supply depot here so that you still have

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.960 
supply depot here so that you still have
a<00:04:39.500> door<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.890> can<00:04:40.010> be<00:04:40.130> open<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.460> closed<00:04:40.730> and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
a door that can be open and closed and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.900 
a door that can be open and closed and
now<00:04:41.960> he's<00:04:42.140> going<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.860> put<00:04:43.040> down<00:04:43.160> some<00:04:43.490> add-ons

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
now he's going to put down some add-ons

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.150 
now he's going to put down some add-ons
which<00:04:44.300> no<00:04:44.780> add-ons<00:04:44.990> are<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.440> most<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.070> these

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
which no add-ons are on most of these

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.740 
which no add-ons are on most of these
production<00:04:46.640> building<00:04:46.910> he's<00:04:47.360> putting<00:04:47.600> down<00:04:47.720> a

production building he's putting down a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.390 
production building he's putting down a
tech<00:04:48.020> lab<00:04:48.230> which<00:04:48.440> kind<00:04:48.740> of<00:04:48.800> takes<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.100> place

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
tech lab which kind of takes the place

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.340 
tech lab which kind of takes the place
at<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.640> Academy<00:04:50.150> with<00:04:50.180> stimpack<00:04:50.690> upgrades

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
and stuff like that and a reactor which

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.330 
and stuff like that and a reactor which
allows<00:04:53.750> him<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.020> have<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.650> production<00:04:54.980> queues

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
allows him to have to production queues

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.520 
allows him to have to production queues
at<00:04:55.520> once<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:55.940> another<00:04:56.810> command<00:04:57.110> center<00:04:57.350> looks

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
at once and another command center looks

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.750 
at once and another command center looks
like<00:04:57.650> he's<00:04:57.770> going<00:04:57.919> to<00:04:58.010> float<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.340> down<00:04:58.370> for<00:04:58.640> his

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760

take a look now at their production so
let's<00:05:18.590> find<00:05:18.770> right<00:05:18.950> here<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:19.940> looks<00:05:20.060> like

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
let's find right here and it looks like

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.700 
let's find right here and it looks like
we've<00:05:20.330> got<00:05:20.360> two<00:05:20.600> dark<00:05:20.840> templars<00:05:21.229> on<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.590> way

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
we've got two dark templars on the way

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.990 
are kind of the replacement for the
vulture<00:05:28.940> but<00:05:29.900> not<00:05:30.080> really<00:05:30.320> they<00:05:31.160> shoot<00:05:31.700> fire

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
vulture but not really they shoot fire

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.140 
vulture but not really they shoot fire
so<00:05:32.270> it's<00:05:32.390> kind<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.660> vulture<00:05:33.140> meets<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:34.150> meets

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
so it's kind of vulture meets I meets

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.900 
so it's kind of vulture meets I meets
fire<00:05:35.390> bat<00:05:35.630> on<00:05:35.900> one<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.520> he's<00:05:37.520> taking<00:05:37.789> down

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
fire bat on one and he's taking down

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.430 
fire bat on one and he's taking down
these<00:05:38.030> destructible<00:05:38.600> rocks<00:05:38.660> now<00:05:39.080> going<00:05:39.289> to<00:05:39.350> go

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
these destructible rocks now going to go

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.969 
these destructible rocks now going to go
for<00:05:39.620> those<00:05:39.740> high<00:05:39.919> yield<00:05:40.190> minerals<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:41.979> his

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
for those high yield minerals and his

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.290 
for those high yield minerals and his
command<00:05:43.340> center<00:05:43.610> is<00:05:43.669> almost<00:05:43.880> done<00:05:44.060> so<00:05:44.210> we<00:05:44.270> can

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
command center is almost done so we can

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.000 
command center is almost done so we can
ship<00:05:44.600> that<00:05:44.720> down<00:05:44.870> but<00:05:45.350> these<00:05:45.440> hellions<00:05:45.919> our

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
ship that down but these hellions our

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.620 
ship that down but these hellions our
jeeps<00:05:46.280> they<00:05:46.520> move<00:05:46.700> like<00:05:46.729> vultures<00:05:47.330> although

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
jeeps they move like vultures although

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.630 
jeeps they move like vultures although
they<00:05:47.810> don't<00:05:47.960> drop<00:05:48.260> mines<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.830> this<00:05:49.280> Marauder

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
they don't drop mines and this Marauder

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.400 
they don't drop mines and this Marauder
is<00:05:49.789> like<00:05:50.060> kind<00:05:50.419> of<00:05:50.479> like<00:05:50.539> a<00:05:50.630> heavy<00:05:50.930> marine

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
is like kind of like a heavy marine

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.750 
is like kind of like a heavy marine
there<00:05:52.070> they're<00:05:52.610> very<00:05:52.789> strong<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:54.760> they're

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
there they're very strong and they're

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.060 
there they're very strong and they're
very<00:05:55.789> good<00:05:56.120> for<00:05:56.570> backing<00:05:57.050> up<00:05:57.140> forces<00:05:57.560> but<00:05:57.950> if

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
very good for backing up forces but if

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.560 
very good for backing up forces but if
you<00:05:58.160> try<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.490> put<00:05:58.729> these<00:05:58.880> on<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.270> front

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
you try and put these on the front

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.870 
you try and put these on the front
directly<00:06:00.110> against<00:06:00.470> like<00:06:00.740> a<00:06:00.770> small<00:06:01.160> force<00:06:01.460> they

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
directly against like a small force they

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.000 
directly against like a small force they
normally<00:06:02.210> get<00:06:02.360> eaten<00:06:02.570> up<00:06:02.720> very<00:06:03.050> quickly<00:06:03.260> but

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
normally get eaten up very quickly but

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.610 
normally get eaten up very quickly but
with<00:06:04.190> Helene<00:06:04.520> support<00:06:04.940> there<00:06:05.419> are<00:06:05.840> very

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
with Helene support there are very

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.469 
with Helene support there are very
useful<00:06:07.070> if<00:06:07.280> you<00:06:07.400> keep<00:06:07.610> them<00:06:07.789> in<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.000> back<00:06:08.180> and

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
useful if you keep them in the back and

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.510 
useful if you keep them in the back and
allow<00:06:08.630> them<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.900> fire<00:06:09.110> over<00:06:09.500> your<00:06:09.650> troops<00:06:09.919> so

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
allow them to fire over your troops so

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.820 
allow them to fire over your troops so
