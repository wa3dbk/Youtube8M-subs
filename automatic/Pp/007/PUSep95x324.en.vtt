okay<00:00:00.480> I'm<00:00:00.599> redoing<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.560> because

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:01.939 
okay I'm redoing this video because

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.370 
okay I'm redoing this video because
people<00:00:02.939> say<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.210> can't<00:00:03.540> see<00:00:03.720> what<00:00:03.840> I'm<00:00:03.959> doing

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
people say you can't see what I'm doing

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.889 
people say you can't see what I'm doing
and<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.620> agree<00:00:04.950> with<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
and I agree with that this is for the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.410 
and I agree with that this is for the
latch<00:00:07.170> that's<00:00:07.589> common<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.460> break<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.179> hold

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
latch that's common to break the hold

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.230 
latch that's common to break the hold
down<00:00:09.599> here<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.050> 7.3<00:00:10.889> air<00:00:11.130> filter<00:00:11.490> there

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
down here on the 7.3 air filter there

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.150 
down here on the 7.3 air filter there
break<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.690> they<00:00:12.750> won't<00:00:12.929> hold<00:00:13.110> any<00:00:13.380> longer<00:00:13.469> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
break and they won't hold any longer and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.849 
break and they won't hold any longer and
your<00:00:14.309> air<00:00:14.460> filters<00:00:14.849> loose<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> won't<00:00:15.480> seal<00:00:15.859> so

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
your air filters loose and won't seal so

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.510 
your air filters loose and won't seal so
I<00:00:16.890> found<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.310> real<00:00:17.490> quick<00:00:17.850> easy<00:00:18.000> fix<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
just remove the battery cover so I get a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.580 
just remove the battery cover so I get a
straight<00:00:22.410> shot<00:00:24.800> take<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> Milwaukee<00:00:26.490> 12<00:00:27.590> m12

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590

quarter<00:00:29.369> inch<00:00:29.460> very<00:00:29.699> ratchet

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 

they<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.990> use<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.470> short<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.070> 1/2<00:01:08.369> inch

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700

screw<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.380> goes<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:11.009> and<00:01:11.729> I'll<00:01:11.880> just

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
screw that goes in there and I'll just

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.390 
screw that goes in there and I'll just
run<00:01:12.329> it<00:01:12.479> in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.520 

now<00:01:22.400> with<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:22.850> on<00:01:23.090> there<00:01:23.330> gives<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.660> lip<00:01:23.990> so

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
now with this on there gives a lip so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.870 
now with this on there gives a lip so
they'd<00:01:24.680> latch<00:01:25.010> it<00:01:25.310> have<00:01:25.400> something<00:01:25.700> that'll

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
they'd latch it have something that'll

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.780 
they'd latch it have something that'll
hold<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.330> it'll<00:01:27.260> keep<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.680> there<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:27.980> I'll<00:01:28.430> show

to<00:01:38.780> catch<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.260> it'll<00:01:40.220> stay<00:01:40.550> fastened

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780 

the<00:01:48.570> only<00:01:48.810> thing<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.370> a<00:01:50.400> stock

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

air<00:01:51.060> filter<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:52.320> pleats<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:52.950> fit<00:01:53.130> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
air filter the pleats will fit in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
air filter the pleats will fit in
between<00:01:53.370> there<00:01:53.760> it's<00:01:53.880> no<00:01:54.000> big<00:01:54.180> deal<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.540> all

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
between there it's no big deal at all

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.920 
between there it's no big deal at all
but<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.470> you're<00:01:55.590> using<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.070> K&amp;N<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:57.270> doesn't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
but if you're using the K&amp;N it doesn't

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.469 
but if you're using the K&amp;N it doesn't
fit<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.400> have<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.729> go<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
fit so you will have to go back in and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.960 
fit so you will have to go back in and
trim<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> excess<00:02:01.110> screw<00:02:01.650> here<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.640> only<00:02:02.790> if

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
you're running a K&amp;N type not this paper

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.999 
you're running a K&amp;N type not this paper
type<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.119> has<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> pleats<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:07.200> no<00:02:07.590> problem

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
type that has the pleats it's no problem
