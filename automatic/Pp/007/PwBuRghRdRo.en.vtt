confusing<00:01:58.969> well<00:01:59.810> having<00:02:00.079> some<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
confusing well having some of the

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.399 
confusing well having some of the
features<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:01.090> ambient<00:02:02.090> noise<00:02:02.409> cancellation

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
features like ambient noise cancellation

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.999 
features like ambient noise cancellation
and<00:02:03.880> also<00:02:04.880> lighting<00:02:05.840> which<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.259> important<00:02:06.770> for

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
and also lighting which is important for

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.969 
and also lighting which is important for
visualization<00:02:07.549> of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
visualization of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.430 
visualization of
lesions<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:10.690> makes<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.019> a<00:02:11.080> much<00:02:11.200> more

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
lesions actually makes it a much more

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.130 
lesions actually makes it a much more
enjoyable<00:02:11.739> day<00:02:12.159> dr.<00:02:12.879> gay<00:02:13.030> there<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> really

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
enjoyable day dr. gay there is a really

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.080 
enjoyable day dr. gay there is a really
large<00:02:14.500> screen<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.190> front<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.489> me<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.879> can<00:02:16.060> you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
large screen in front of me and can you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.030 
large screen in front of me and can you
tell<00:02:16.390> us<00:02:16.420> what<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.349> used<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.860> some

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
tell us what this is used for and some

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.850 
tell us what this is used for and some
of<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.250> features<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.349> well<00:02:20.349> we<00:02:20.530> feel<00:02:20.709> like

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
of the features of it well we feel like

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.280 
of the features of it well we feel like
this<00:02:21.099> enables<00:02:21.730> medical<00:02:22.659> students<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.170> other

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
this enables medical students and other

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.350 
this enables medical students and other
learners<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.519> images<00:02:24.819> better<00:02:25.090> than

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
learners to see the images better than

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.050 
learners to see the images better than
crowding<00:02:25.810> around<00:02:25.900> at<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.379> monitor<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.819> also

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
crowding around at a monitor it's also

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.300 
crowding around at a monitor it's also
better<00:02:28.450> than<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.170> digital<00:02:29.530> projector<00:02:32.310> so

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
better than just a digital projector so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.500 
better than just a digital projector so
you<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.549> now<00:02:33.730> one<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> things<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.450> I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
you know now one of the things that I

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.300 
you know now one of the things that I
think<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.750> unique<00:02:34.900> about<00:02:35.349> this<00:02:35.650> space<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
think is unique about this space is the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.039 
think is unique about this space is the
fact<00:02:36.489> that<00:02:36.610> they<00:02:36.760> put<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.120> lot<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.450> things<00:02:37.840> to

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
fact that they put in a lot of things to

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.059 
fact that they put in a lot of things to
help<00:02:38.170> create<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.560> better<00:02:38.590> work<00:02:38.950> environment

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
help create a better work environment

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.460 
help create a better work environment
for<00:02:40.030> example<00:02:40.360> there<00:02:40.480> are<00:02:40.510> these<00:02:40.690> large<00:02:41.019> white

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
for example there are these large white

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.020 
for example there are these large white
kidney<00:02:41.950> shaped<00:02:42.190> things<00:02:42.459> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> ceilings

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
kidney shaped things on the ceilings

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.759 
kidney shaped things on the ceilings
that<00:02:43.120> helped<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.480> dead<00:02:43.629> in<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> noise<00:02:43.959> gray

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
that helped it dead in the noise gray

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.470 
that helped it dead in the noise gray
material<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.549> walls<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.030> also<00:02:46.299> make<00:02:46.450> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
material on the walls it also make it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.809 
material on the walls it also make it
quiet<00:02:46.810> music<00:02:47.650> go<00:02:47.890> along<00:02:48.069> with<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.340> audio

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
quiet music go along with the audio

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.330 
quiet music go along with the audio
enhancements<00:02:49.480> there's<00:02:49.750> made<00:02:50.200> some<00:02:50.440> some

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
enhancements there's made some some

the<00:03:03.160> future<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.519> radiology<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.780> tell<00:03:04.989> us<00:03:05.109> a

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the future of radiology you tell us a

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.009 
the future of radiology you tell us a
little<00:03:05.170> bit<00:03:05.319> more<00:03:05.560> about<00:03:05.769> what<00:03:07.019> technologies

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
little bit more about what technologies

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.380 
little bit more about what technologies
would<00:03:08.109> actually<00:03:08.410> be<00:03:08.530> utilized<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.040> there<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
would actually be utilized in there the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.170 
would actually be utilized in there the
