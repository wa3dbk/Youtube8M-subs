I<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.159> iPhones<00:01:05.580> around

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.310 
I don't I don't like the iPhones around
the<00:01:06.150> design<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.080> much<00:01:07.680> compared<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
the design and that much compared to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
the design and that much compared to
compared<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.920> design<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.909> a5<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
compared to the design here on the a5 I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
compared to the design here on the a5 I
definitely<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.409> believe<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> e5<00:01:14.220> looks

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
definitely do believe with the e5 looks

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
definitely do believe with the e5 looks
a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.240> more<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> family<00:01:15.930> phone

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a little bit more like a family phone

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.570 
a little bit more like a family phone
and<00:01:17.630> yeah<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.380> look<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and yeah it this look if this would be a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
and yeah it this look if this would be a
couple<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> iPhone

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
couple then I think that the iPhone

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.219 
couple then I think that the iPhone
would<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> girlfriend<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.090> let's<00:01:25.080> use

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
would be the girlfriend here let's use

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
would be the girlfriend here let's use
my<00:01:25.439> my<00:01:25.979> opinion<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.700> looks<00:01:26.970> like

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
my my opinion there this looks like

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.710 
my my opinion there this looks like
grown-up<00:01:27.600> s2<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.119> one<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.360> five<00:01:30.570> minutes

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
grown-up s2 so this one is five minutes

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.740 
grown-up s2 so this one is five minutes
also<00:01:30.990> versus<00:01:31.530> 4.7<00:01:32.100> inch<00:01:32.360> both<00:01:33.360> fog<00:01:33.600> around

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
also versus 4.7 inch both fog around

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.350 
also versus 4.7 inch both fog around
720p<00:01:34.619> display<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.520> pixel<00:01:35.820> density<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
720p display but the pixel density is a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.170 
720p display but the pixel density is a
little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.659> higher<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.490> iPhone

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
little bit higher here on the iPhone

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899 
little bit higher here on the iPhone
display<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.020> mean<00:01:40.140> both<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:41.130> very<00:01:41.579> very

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
display but I mean both have very very

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.690 
display but I mean both have very very
high<00:01:42.240> quality<00:01:42.299> displays<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.549> cost

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
high quality displays and this one cost

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.899 
high quality displays and this one cost
around<00:01:44.790> 400<00:01:45.540> euros<00:01:46.100> versus<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> iPhone<00:01:47.700> at

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
around 400 euros versus the iPhone at

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
around 400 euros versus the iPhone at
cost<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.390> thinking<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.750> 600<00:01:49.380> euro<00:01:49.560> or

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
cost or thinking about 600 euro or

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.499 
cost or thinking about 600 euro or
something<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
something like that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.710 
something like that
Snapdragon<00:01:52.320> did<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> major<00:01:53.759> downside<00:01:54.420> with

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
Snapdragon did the major downside with

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.780 
Snapdragon did the major downside with
the<00:01:55.280> with<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.110> galaxy<00:01:58.110> a5<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.460> games

the with the the galaxy a5 is that games

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.740 
the with the the galaxy a5 is that games
won't<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> best<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.409> light<00:02:02.369> experience<00:02:03.060> at

won't be the best a light experience at

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530 
won't be the best a light experience at
least<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.619> talk<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.329> like<00:02:06.329> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
least not if we talk about like really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.770 
least not if we talk about like really
high<00:02:06.840> names<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.530> GTA

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
high names like GTA

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.680 
high names like GTA
because<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.930> doesn't<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.650> powerful

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
because it doesn't have that powerful

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.670 
because it doesn't have that powerful
engine<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:15.050> because<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.260> has<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
engine for that because it has a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.150 
engine for that because it has a
Snapdragon<00:02:17.100> 410<00:02:17.520> quad-core<00:02:18.210> per<00:02:18.800> 243<00:02:19.800> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
horrible setup or at least for like GT I

bad stuff with this one I mean first off
I<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.480> back<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.840> way<00:03:09.960> better

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I think this one the back is way better

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.060 
I think this one the back is way better
it<00:03:10.770> feels<00:03:11.190> more<00:03:11.640> smooth<00:03:12.110> but<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.290> camera<00:03:13.650> also

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
which of course looks very different I

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.999 
which of course looks very different I
mean<00:04:30.960> iOS<00:04:31.500> versus<00:04:31.949> Android<00:04:32.370> but<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:33.300> basic

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
mean iOS versus Android but the basic

mean iOS versus Android but the basic
features<00:04:35.009> are<00:04:35.280> pretty<00:04:35.460> much<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.850> same<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.180> mean

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
features are pretty much the same I mean

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.719 
features are pretty much the same I mean
you<00:04:36.419> can<00:04:36.600> call<00:04:36.810> with<00:04:36.990> both<00:04:37.229> devices<00:04:37.729> and

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
you can call with both devices and

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:39.770

that's<00:04:39.240> nice

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
that's nice

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.499

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
like always swipe and this is that's a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.810 
like always swipe and this is that's a
little<00:05:00.270> bit<00:05:00.389> annoying<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:01.110> Sierra<00:05:02.039> folders

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.780 
the processor if you're gonna game a lot
but<00:05:52.510> in<00:05:52.570> terms<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:52.900> like<00:05:53.020> normal<00:05:53.740> usage<00:05:54.010> I<00:05:54.580> mean

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
but in terms of like normal usage I mean

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.240 
but in terms of like normal usage I mean
it's<00:05:55.120> good<00:05:55.360> performance<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.110> know<00:05:56.500> it's

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
it's good performance you know it's

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.000 
it's good performance you know it's
really<00:05:57.730> really<00:05:58.090> good<00:05:58.240> performance<00:05:59.010> but

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
really really good performance but

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.160 
really really good performance but
gaming<00:06:00.550> heavy<00:06:00.940> games<00:06:01.510> that<00:06:01.930> could<00:06:02.050> be<00:06:02.140> a

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
gaming heavy games that could be a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.710 
gaming heavy games that could be a
problem<00:06:02.410> but<00:06:03.340> then<00:06:03.460> again<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.850> enjoyed<00:06:04.630> a

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
problem but then again I enjoyed a

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.230 
problem but then again I enjoyed a
bigger<00:06:04.900> display<00:06:05.320> in<00:06:05.620> cheaper<00:06:06.310> price<00:06:06.580> and<00:06:06.880> a

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
bigger display in cheaper price and a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.880 
bigger display in cheaper price and a
better<00:06:07.450> like<00:06:07.750> camera<00:06:08.290> overall<00:06:08.650> their

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
better like camera overall their

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.380 
better like camera overall their
function<00:06:09.280> camera<00:06:09.640> right<00:06:09.790> nice<00:06:09.940> and<00:06:10.180> a<00:06:10.210> bigger

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
function camera right nice and a bigger

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.050 
function camera right nice and a bigger
battery<00:06:10.890> so<00:06:11.890> I<00:06:12.220> would<00:06:12.520> definitely<00:06:12.910> go

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
battery so I would definitely go

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.670 
battery so I would definitely go
probably<00:06:13.450> with<00:06:13.540> that<00:06:13.660> one<00:06:13.840> often<00:06:14.080> the

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
probably with that one often the

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.240 
probably with that one often the
experience<00:06:15.340> of<00:06:15.580> a<00:06:15.880> more<00:06:16.810> open<00:06:17.380> and<00:06:17.620> open<00:06:17.830> UI

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
experience of a more open and open UI

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.640 
experience of a more open and open UI
and<00:06:18.700> I<00:06:19.240> also<00:06:19.390> do<00:06:19.630> believe<00:06:19.780> that<00:06:20.110> it<00:06:20.350> feels

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
and I also do believe that it feels

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.180 
and I also do believe that it feels
better<00:06:20.860> in<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:21.460> hand<00:06:21.670> and<00:06:21.820> stuff<00:06:21.910> like<00:06:22.030> that

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
better in the hand and stuff like that

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.940 
better in the hand and stuff like that
so<00:06:24.190> yeah<00:06:24.880> I<00:06:25.120> think<00:06:25.330> this<00:06:25.630> is<00:06:25.840> a<00:06:25.870> cool<00:06:26.230> quality

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
so yeah I think this is a cool quality

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.540 
so yeah I think this is a cool quality
device<00:06:27.750> so<00:06:28.980> definite<00:06:29.980> let<00:06:30.070> me<00:06:30.160> know<00:06:30.250> what<00:06:30.430> you

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
device so definite let me know what you

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.670 
device so definite let me know what you
want<00:06:30.730> to<00:06:30.820> say<00:06:30.940> and<00:06:31.180> then<00:06:31.840> maybe<00:06:32.380> they<00:06:32.620> were

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
want to say and then maybe they were

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.210 
want to say and then maybe they were
very<00:06:32.800> about<00:06:33.010> that<00:06:33.910> was<00:06:34.030> me
