you're gonna grab your sections the one
good<00:02:38.000> thing<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.989> your

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
good thing with this is that your

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.650 
good thing with this is that your
sections<00:02:39.590> are<00:02:39.709> going<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.890> be<00:02:40.010> smaller<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.030> it's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
sections are going to be smaller so it's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.770 
sections are going to be smaller so it's
going<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> little<00:02:42.410> bit<00:02:42.530> easier<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:43.040> use

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
going to be a little bit easier to use

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.300 
going to be a little bit easier to use
you're<00:02:44.780> not<00:02:44.959> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.530> pull<00:02:45.799> as<00:02:46.069> long

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you're not going to have to pull as long

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.250 
you're not going to have to pull as long
the<00:02:46.730> smoothness<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.599> going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.989> there<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the smoothness is going to be there a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:57.610 
the smoothness is going to be there a
little<00:02:48.709> bit<00:02:48.829> easier<00:02:50.139> grab<00:02:51.139> your<00:02:51.319> other

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.940 

pick<00:02:58.129> up<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.310> little<00:02:58.610> section<00:02:59.470> now<00:03:00.470> also

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
pick up that little section now also

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.030 
pick up that little section now also
because<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> bit<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.090> smaller<00:03:02.540> braid

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
because this is a bit of a smaller braid

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.589 
because this is a bit of a smaller braid
you're<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.250> want<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.489> grab<00:03:04.640> smaller

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
actual braid itself is a lot smaller the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.440 
actual braid itself is a lot smaller the
sections<00:04:08.710> aren't<00:04:08.950> going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> be<00:04:09.370> as<00:04:09.520> big<00:04:09.820> this

is<00:04:10.660> one<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.840> those<00:04:11.110> scenarios<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.010> would

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
is one of those scenarios that it would

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.070 
is one of those scenarios that it would
be<00:04:12.220> payoff<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:13.030> use<00:04:13.210> one<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.450> those<00:04:13.660> smaller

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
be payoff to use one of those smaller

be payoff to use one of those smaller
rubber<00:04:14.410> bands<00:04:14.680> we<00:04:14.920> discussed<00:04:15.340> earlier<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
rubber bands we discussed earlier so

rubber bands we discussed earlier so
that<00:04:17.080> way<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.620> holds<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.130> brain<00:04:18.340> nicely<00:04:18.820> and

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
that way it holds the brain nicely and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.840 
that way it holds the brain nicely and
it<00:04:19.060> doesn't<00:04:19.360> fall<00:04:19.570> out

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.860

connect the pieces you can also use the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.070 
connect the pieces you can also use the
upside-down<00:04:31.350> French<00:04:32.070> braid<00:04:32.660> which<00:04:33.660> we<00:04:33.840> just
