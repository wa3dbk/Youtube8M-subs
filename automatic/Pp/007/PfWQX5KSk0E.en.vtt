00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.380
 Hello, today I want to tell you how 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.879
 You can disable the immobilizer 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.840
 disable of course it is said in quotes 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:23.680
 notes dismantled steering column 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.680
 I removed the chip except from here and 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:32.560
 I placed here the ignition lock 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.560
 Ignition built-in antenna 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.289
 put it like this 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.289
 electrical tape 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:56.679
 through seen here he is here in 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.679
 antenna principle is well read 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.730
 errors do not indicate that the type is not 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:20.860
 read the error looks now 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:29.930
 I will show how the chip from here the lock I clamp the chip 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:33.980
 including light up such a fire 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.970
 machine excluded that the chip was not found 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.970
 occitan 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.430
 the machine won't start 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.610
 that this did not happen when you 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.410
 let's say autostart on 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.250
 the car 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:03.970
 or make and duplicate key duplicate 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:10.260
 key without a chip this did not happen and 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:19.600
 the car was got in what way 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:22.380
 do more tell you what is 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.380
 like this 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.850
 such is its polarization so that it is good 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.850
 was read 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.850
 Thank you all for your attention
