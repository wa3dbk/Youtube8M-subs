overhead perspective I believe that the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.020 
overhead perspective I believe that the
genius<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.920> this<00:00:58.070> game<00:00:58.309> is<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.519> instead<00:00:58.910> of

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
genius of this game is that instead of

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.729 
genius of this game is that instead of
trying<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.329> cram<00:00:59.600> every<00:00:59.960> playable<00:01:00.410> movie

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
trying to cram every playable movie

trying to cram every playable movie
scene<00:01:00.980> into<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.309> particular<00:01:01.820> mode<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.059> gameplay

scene into a particular mode of gameplay

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.689 
scene into a particular mode of gameplay
they<00:01:02.899> diversified<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:03.739> what<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.280> mean<00:01:04.550> is<00:01:04.670> that

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
they diversified it what I mean is that

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.100 
they diversified it what I mean is that
they<00:01:04.909> didn't<00:01:05.180> throw<00:01:05.300> out<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.659> movie<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
they didn't throw out the movie and

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.720 
they didn't throw out the movie and
force<00:01:06.320> every<00:01:06.620> level<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.950> become<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.280> generic

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
force every level to become a generic

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.880 
force every level to become a generic
shooter<00:01:08.090> level<00:01:08.510> or<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> flying<00:01:09.140> level<00:01:09.470> or<00:01:09.860> a

shooter level or a flying level or a

shooter level or a flying level or a
fighting<00:01:10.310> level<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.120> use<00:01:11.300> another<00:01:11.600> example<00:01:11.780> a

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
fighting level to use another example a

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.470 
fighting level to use another example a
scuba<00:01:12.680> diving<00:01:13.040> level<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:13.970> could<00:01:14.150> have<00:01:14.270> so

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
scuba diving level they could have so

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.420 
scuba diving level they could have so
easily<00:01:14.510> have<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> typical<00:01:15.830> side-scrolling

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
easily have the typical side-scrolling

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.610 
easily have the typical side-scrolling
underwater<00:01:17.000> level<00:01:17.480> where<00:01:17.660> you<00:01:17.750> kill<00:01:18.020> frogmen

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
underwater level where you kill frogmen

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.560 
underwater level where you kill frogmen
and<00:01:18.920> avoid<00:01:19.190> obstacles<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.090> swim<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:20.360> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
and avoid obstacles and swim to the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.450 
and avoid obstacles and swim to the
plane<00:01:20.810> at<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.080> end<00:01:21.230> but<00:01:21.800> instead<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.130> doing

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
plane at the end but instead of doing

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.890 
plane at the end but instead of doing
that<00:01:22.490> boring<00:01:22.970> crap<00:01:23.270> they<00:01:23.480> did<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.750> exactly

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
that boring crap they did it exactly

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.020 
that boring crap they did it exactly
like<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.530> movie<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.070> have<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.730> fire<00:01:26.000> a

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
like the movie you have to fire a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.240 
like the movie you have to fire a
harpoon<00:01:26.570> into<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.020> plane<00:01:27.290> right<00:01:27.740> up<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.100> it

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
harpoon into the plane right up to it

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.670 
harpoon into the plane right up to it
and<00:01:28.340> then<00:01:28.430> climb<00:01:28.760> on<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.870> rather<00:01:30.080> than<00:01:30.200> working

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
and then climb on so rather than working

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.410 
and then climb on so rather than working
against<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.220> source<00:01:31.490> material<00:01:32.030> they<00:01:32.210> work

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
against the source material they work

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.940 
against the source material they work
with<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:32.990> therefore<00:01:33.170> make<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> better<00:01:33.830> game

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
with it and therefore make a better game

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.250 
with it and therefore make a better game
now<00:01:34.910> this<00:01:35.090> isn't<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.450> first<00:01:35.540> time<00:01:35.990> such

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260

be rather annoying because you have to
point<00:02:24.830> your<00:02:24.980> cursor<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.640> direction<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.150> an

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
enemy and then fire unfortunately if you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.979 
enemy and then fire unfortunately if you
have<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.000> turn<00:02:29.150> your<00:02:29.330> cursor<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.810> another

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
have to turn your cursor in another

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.259 
have to turn your cursor in another
direction<00:02:30.200> bond<00:02:30.769> will<00:02:30.950> fire<00:02:31.160> anyway<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.209> you

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
direction bond will fire anyway so you

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.119 
direction bond will fire anyway so you
end<00:02:32.480> up<00:02:32.569> wasting<00:02:32.989> around<00:02:33.349> for<00:02:33.590> nothing

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129

end up wasting around for nothing
another<00:02:34.670> problem<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.390> when<00:02:35.510> bonds<00:02:35.870> gun

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
another problem is that when bonds gun

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.839 
another problem is that when bonds gun

runs out of ammo he freezes up for a
second<00:02:38.239> while<00:02:38.360> reloading<00:02:38.799> okay<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:39.860> be<00:02:40.040> fair

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
second while reloading okay to be fair

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.039 
second while reloading okay to be fair
it's<00:02:40.489> realistic<00:02:40.940> but<00:02:41.390> still<00:02:41.629> it's<00:02:41.840> very

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
it's realistic but still it's very

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.449 
it's realistic but still it's very
annoying<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> middle<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.069> gun<00:02:43.280> battle

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
to have bond freeze up and turn himself

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
dick would have been too much to ask to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.960 
dick would have been too much to ask to
just<00:03:06.620> make<00:03:06.769> them<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.980> little<00:03:07.190> bit<00:03:07.459> bigger

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
just make them a little bit bigger

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.360 
just make them a little bit bigger
anyway<00:03:08.720> barn<00:03:09.049> these<00:03:09.260> minor<00:03:09.500> criticisms<00:03:10.190> this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.490 
anyway barn these minor criticisms this
level<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.730> actually<00:03:10.879> pretty<00:03:11.329> fun<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:12.349> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
level is actually pretty fun I like the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.170 
level is actually pretty fun I like the
fact<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.829> you're<00:03:13.040> given<00:03:13.340> limited<00:03:13.640> ammo<00:03:14.030> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
fact that you're given limited ammo and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.550 
fact that you're given limited ammo and
you<00:03:14.239> have<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.510> conserve<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.110> choose<00:03:15.410> your

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
you have to conserve it and choose your

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.860 
you have to conserve it and choose your
shots<00:03:15.799> wisely<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:16.819> not<00:03:17.090> like<00:03:17.239> contro<00:03:17.720> you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
shots wisely it's not like contro you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.330 
shots wisely it's not like contro you
can<00:03:18.019> run<00:03:18.230> in<00:03:18.349> gun<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.709> fire<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> billion

bullets<00:03:19.670> endlessly<00:03:20.030> which<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.480> not<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.750> say<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
bullets endlessly which is not to say I

this<00:03:23.120> case<00:03:23.389> there's<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.720> bit<00:03:23.930> more<00:03:23.959> strategy

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
this case there's a bit more strategy

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.890 
this case there's a bit more strategy
involved<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.670> have<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:26.000> seek<00:03:26.209> cover<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.780> give

you<00:03:28.970> end<00:03:29.000> up<00:03:29.209> wasting<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.720> lot<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.989> ammo

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
you end up wasting a lot of ammo

you end up wasting a lot of ammo
fortunately<00:03:31.280> bad<00:03:31.489> guys<00:03:31.730> do<00:03:31.940> provide<00:03:32.329> more

another way to off the bad guys is to

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.280 
another way to off the bad guys is to
shoot<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.269> barrels<00:03:38.630> they're<00:03:38.870> hiding<00:03:39.170> behind

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
shoot the barrels they're hiding behind

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.680

and blow them up unfortunately you don't

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.599 
and blow them up unfortunately you don't

of<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.530> other<00:03:45.650> small<00:03:45.980> details<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.609> I<00:03:46.639> like

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
of the other small details that I like

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.610 
of the other small details that I like
that<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.239> bad<00:03:47.420> guys<00:03:47.690> actually<00:03:48.200> run<00:03:48.380> away

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
that the bad guys actually run away

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.740 
that the bad guys actually run away
which<00:03:48.889> is<00:03:49.040> true<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.400> movie<00:03:49.819> after<00:03:50.599> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
which is true to the movie after the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.449 
which is true to the movie after the
second<00:03:51.139> level<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.500> get<00:03:51.650> into<00:03:51.889> your<00:03:52.010> chopper

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
second level you get into your chopper

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.610 
second level you get into your chopper
and<00:03:52.519> chase<00:03:52.730> after<00:03:52.940> Sanchez's<00:03:53.630> plane<00:03:53.930> just

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
and chase after Sanchez's plane just

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.140 
and chase after Sanchez's plane just
like<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.889> movie<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.310> have<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.609> hover<00:03:55.790> over

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
like the movie you have to hover over

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.509 
like the movie you have to hover over
the<00:03:56.269> planes<00:03:56.540> tail<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.109> naba<00:03:57.319> however<00:03:58.280> this

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
the planes tail and naba however this

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.550 
the planes tail and naba however this
level<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.209> short<00:03:59.599> and<00:03:59.750> so<00:03:59.930> easy<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.530> I

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
level is so short and so easy that I

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.140 
level is so short and so easy that I
almost<00:04:00.799> don't<00:04:01.130> think<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.400> qualifies<00:04:01.579> as<00:04:02.120> a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
almost don't think it qualifies as a

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.240 
almost don't think it qualifies as a
level<00:04:02.599> it's<00:04:03.109> more<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.560> mini<00:04:03.769> game<00:04:04.069> if

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
level it's more of a mini game if

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.370 
level it's more of a mini game if
anything<00:04:04.700> sure<00:04:05.329> there's<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.630> time<00:04:05.900> limit<00:04:06.079> but

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
anything sure there's a time limit but

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.170 
anything sure there's a time limit but
in<00:04:06.500> many<00:04:06.620> cases<00:04:06.889> I<00:04:07.190> managed<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.519> nab<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.970> plane

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
in many cases I managed to nab the plane

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.629 
in many cases I managed to nab the plane
in<00:04:08.329> 10<00:04:08.510> seconds<00:04:08.959> or<00:04:09.019> less<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:10.010> unfortunately

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
in 10 seconds or less so unfortunately

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.099 
in 10 seconds or less so unfortunately
there's<00:04:10.910> not<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.060> lot<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.359> challenge<00:04:11.780> but<00:04:11.959> it's

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
there's not a lot of challenge but it's

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.440 
there's not a lot of challenge but it's
still<00:04:12.260> fun<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.560> do<00:04:12.799> also<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.790> really<00:04:14.150> like<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
still fun to do also I really like the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.879 
still fun to do also I really like the
detail<00:04:14.599> where<00:04:15.019> James<00:04:15.260> jumps<00:04:15.620> out<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
detail where James jumps out of the

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.560 
detail where James jumps out of the
plane<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.340> his<00:04:16.430> British<00:04:16.729> flag<00:04:17.000> parachute

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
plane and his British flag parachute

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.750 
plane and his British flag parachute
deploys<00:04:17.959> once<00:04:18.709> again<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.340> nice<00:04:19.459> touch

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
deploys once again it's a nice touch

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.089 
deploys once again it's a nice touch
that<00:04:20.060> mirrors<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.510> movie<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.500> fourth<00:04:21.769> level

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
that mirrors the movie the fourth level

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.890 
that mirrors the movie the fourth level
is<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.250> aforementioned<00:04:22.610> scuba<00:04:23.300> diving<00:04:23.660> scene

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
is the aforementioned scuba diving scene

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.810 
is the aforementioned scuba diving scene
like<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.650> other<00:04:24.800> levels<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.370> follows<00:04:25.669> the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
like the other levels it follows the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.089 
like the other levels it follows the
film<00:04:26.030> very<00:04:26.240> closely<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:27.349> have<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.680> dodge<00:04:27.860> the

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
film very closely you have to dodge the

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.060 
film very closely you have to dodge the
fire<00:04:28.310> from<00:04:28.610> gun<00:04:28.820> boats<00:04:29.060> by<00:04:29.210> going<00:04:29.539> under

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
fire from gun boats by going under

fire from gun boats by going under
but<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.520> can<00:04:30.610> only<00:04:30.700> stay<00:04:30.970> underwater<00:04:31.180> for<00:04:31.600> a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
but you can only stay underwater for a

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.150 
but you can only stay underwater for a
limited<00:04:31.960> time<00:04:32.020> before<00:04:32.500> your<00:04:32.620> air<00:04:32.770> runs<00:04:33.010> out

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
limited time before your air runs out

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.040 
limited time before your air runs out
and<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.640> resurface<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.840> best

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
and you have to resurface the best

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.870 
and you have to resurface the best
strategies<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.740> stay<00:04:35.950> underwater<00:04:36.190> as<00:04:36.550> much<00:04:36.730> as

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
strategies to stay underwater as much as

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.460 
strategies to stay underwater as much as
possible<00:04:37.060> though<00:04:37.540> because<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.020> protects<00:04:38.350> you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
possible though because it protects you

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.500 
possible though because it protects you
from<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.740> bullets<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.640> can<00:04:39.790> also<00:04:39.940> get<00:04:40.180> extra

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
from the bullets you can also get extra

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.450 
from the bullets you can also get extra
points<00:04:40.690> by<00:04:40.930> destroying<00:04:41.320> cocaine<00:04:41.800> parcels<00:04:42.340> and

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
points by destroying cocaine parcels and

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.920 
points by destroying cocaine parcels and
killing<00:04:42.730> frogmen<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.360> are<00:04:43.420> coming<00:04:43.750> after

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
killing frogmen that are coming after

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.050 
killing frogmen that are coming after
you<00:04:44.200> in<00:04:44.470> fact<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.220> need<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.520> kill<00:04:45.730> one<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:45.910> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
you in fact you need to kill one of the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.730 
you in fact you need to kill one of the
frogmen<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.660> get<00:04:46.810> their<00:04:46.960> spear<00:04:47.260> guns<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.650> you

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
frogmen to get their spear guns so you

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.650 
frogmen to get their spear guns so you
can<00:04:47.860> shoot<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.190> into<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.490> plane<00:04:48.730> but<00:04:49.390> you<00:04:49.510> only

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
can shoot it into the plane but you only

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.630 
can shoot it into the plane but you only
get<00:04:49.870> one<00:04:49.930> shot<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.980> miss<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.430> have<00:04:51.610> to

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
get one shot so if you miss you have to

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.250 
get one shot so if you miss you have to
kill<00:04:51.940> another<00:04:52.120> frogman<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.900> get<00:04:53.020> another

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
kill another frogman to get another

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.230 
kill another frogman to get another
spear<00:04:53.620> gun<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.040> like<00:04:54.520> this<00:04:54.700> level<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.090> lot

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
spear gun I like this level a lot

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.940 
spear gun I like this level a lot
because<00:04:55.450> it's<00:04:55.750> very<00:04:55.810> faithful<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.680> film

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
because it's very faithful to the film

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.950 
because it's very faithful to the film
it<00:04:57.100> provides<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.550> nice<00:04:57.670> challenge<00:04:58.210> my<00:04:58.780> only

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
it provides a nice challenge my only

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.150 
it provides a nice challenge my only
complaint<00:04:59.260> with<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.620> level<00:04:59.980> is<00:05:00.070> the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
complaint with this level is the

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.190 
complaint with this level is the
appearance<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.760> plane<00:05:01.090> sometimes<00:05:01.840> the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
appearance of the plane sometimes the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.870 
appearance of the plane sometimes the
plane<00:05:02.410> appears<00:05:02.770> very<00:05:02.950> early<00:05:03.400> in<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> level

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
plane appears very early in the level

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.520 
plane appears very early in the level
and<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.060> can<00:05:04.150> spirit<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.840> get<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.080> in<00:05:05.230> 30

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
and you can spirit and get on in 30

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.800 
and you can spirit and get on in 30
seconds<00:05:06.010> or<00:05:06.070> less<00:05:06.130> other<00:05:06.970> times<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.510> seems<00:05:07.690> to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
seconds or less other times it seems to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.450 
seconds or less other times it seems to
take<00:05:07.960> forever<00:05:08.170> to<00:05:08.530> show<00:05:08.740> up<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:09.070> if<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.250> miss

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
take forever to show up and if you miss

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.130 
take forever to show up and if you miss
it<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.760> can<00:05:09.910> go<00:05:10.030> off<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.510> have<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.780> keep<00:05:10.930> on

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
it it can go off and you have to keep on

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.380 
it it can go off and you have to keep on
swimming<00:05:11.440> till<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:11.860> reappears<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.730> think<00:05:13.270> it

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
swimming till it reappears I think it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.670 
swimming till it reappears I think it
might<00:05:13.540> have<00:05:13.660> worked<00:05:13.810> better<00:05:14.080> if<00:05:14.320> you<00:05:14.410> had<00:05:14.560> to

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
might have worked better if you had to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.800 
might have worked better if you had to
kill<00:05:14.890> a<00:05:14.920> number<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.280> frogmen<00:05:15.820> like<00:05:16.000> say<00:05:16.180> 10<00:05:16.510> and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
kill a number of frogmen like say 10 and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.630 
kill a number of frogmen like say 10 and
then<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.020> plane<00:05:17.260> shows<00:05:17.530> up<00:05:17.800> other<00:05:18.370> than<00:05:18.580> that

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
then the plane shows up other than that

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.970 
then the plane shows up other than that
minor<00:05:19.030> gripe<00:05:19.360> I<00:05:19.570> think<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.960> fun<00:05:20.170> level<00:05:20.410> the

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
minor gripe I think it's a fun level the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.740 
minor gripe I think it's a fun level the
last<00:05:21.160> level<00:05:21.580> in<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.760> game<00:05:21.970> and<00:05:22.210> my<00:05:22.270> personal

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
last level in the game and my personal

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.870 
last level in the game and my personal
favorite<00:05:23.170> is<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.320> tanker<00:05:23.770> chase<00:05:24.040> not<00:05:24.700> to

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
favorite is the tanker chase not to

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.370 
favorite is the tanker chase not to
sound<00:05:25.090> like<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.270> broken<00:05:25.480> record<00:05:25.840> but<00:05:26.170> once

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
sound like a broken record but once

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.110 
sound like a broken record but once
again<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.830> follows<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.250> movie<00:05:27.520> very<00:05:27.760> closely

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
again it follows the movie very closely

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.420 
again it follows the movie very closely
you<00:05:28.870> jump<00:05:29.170> on<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.440> plane<00:05:29.650> onto<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.160> truck
