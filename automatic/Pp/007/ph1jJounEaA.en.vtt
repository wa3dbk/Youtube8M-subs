blocks on the free version on the not on

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.670 
blocks on the free version on the not on
the<00:00:42.190> freezing<00:00:42.489> on<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.180> paid<00:00:43.390> version<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
the freezing on the paid version the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.969 
the freezing on the paid version the
paid<00:00:44.920> version<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.460> lot<00:00:45.670> better<00:00:46.170> cuz<00:00:47.170> just

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
paid version is a lot better cuz just

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.539 
paid version is a lot better cuz just
this<00:00:48.129> so<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:48.760> suggested<00:00:49.360> gate<00:00:50.040> right<00:00:51.040> at<00:00:51.369> the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
this so I suggested gate right at the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:57.030 
this so I suggested gate right at the
first<00:00:51.760> glitch<00:00:53.549> is<00:00:54.549> if<00:00:54.790> you<00:00:54.909> make<00:00:55.089> two<00:00:55.420> holes<00:00:56.379> to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
first glitch is if you make two holes to

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.520 
first glitch is if you make two holes to
go<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.699> ground<00:00:57.909> deep<00:00:58.210> number<00:00:58.510> but<00:00:58.989> trampled<00:00:59.409> in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
go to ground deep number but trampled in

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.340 
go to ground deep number but trampled in
the<00:00:59.559> bomb<00:00:59.769> and<00:01:00.040> then<00:01:00.900> triangular<00:01:01.900> ice<00:01:02.049> cream

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
the bomb and then triangular ice cream

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.829 
the bomb and then triangular ice cream
on<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.589> top<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.879> when<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.239> start<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.689> slip

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
on the top and when you start to slip

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.399 
on the top and when you start to slip
down<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.670> hold<00:01:06.670> on<00:01:06.850> fit<00:01:07.090> for<00:01:07.360> about<00:01:07.540> 10<00:01:07.840> seconds

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
down it hold on fit for about 10 seconds

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.300 
down it hold on fit for about 10 seconds
then<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.689> let<00:01:10.840> go<00:01:11.020> on<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:11.290> will<00:01:11.470> fly<00:01:11.830> up<00:01:12.009> into

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
then you let go on you will fly up into

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.710 
then you let go on you will fly up into
your<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.220> your<00:01:15.369> buns<00:01:15.610> back<00:01:15.850> down<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
your and your buns back down on it the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.010 
your and your buns back down on it the
sounds<00:01:20.110> are<00:01:20.200> bare<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.760> then<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:21.880> can<00:01:22.060> one

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
sounds are bare and then you can one

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.380 
sounds are bare and then you can one
done<00:01:23.320> plaything<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.500> move<00:01:26.650> on<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
done plaything so you can move on to the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.990 
done plaything so you can move on to the
second<00:01:28.930> one<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:30.400> one<00:01:31.390> where<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.320> make<00:01:33.000> two

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
second one is one where you make two

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.910 
second one is one where you make two
separate<00:01:34.390> holes<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.780> ground<00:01:34.870> for<00:01:35.230> a<00:01:35.740> nice

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
separate holes in the ground for a nice

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.430 
separate holes in the ground for a nice
triangle<00:01:36.460> in<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.450> opposite<00:01:37.780> direction<00:01:37.930> of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
triangle in the opposite direction of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.920 
triangle in the opposite direction of
why<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.620> want<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.860> face<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:40.210> if<00:01:40.480> I'm<00:01:40.690> going

why you want to face so if I'm going
over<00:01:41.200> here<00:01:41.530> but<00:01:41.979> ice<00:01:42.100> cube<00:01:42.400> all<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.700> first

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
over here but ice cube all the first

fire you a reasonable distance make in
the<00:02:02.950> glitch<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:04.350> over<00:02:05.350> here

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.220 

hold<00:02:18.350> on

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.080 

I<00:02:24.709> will<00:02:25.709> go<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:25.980> here<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.760> will<00:02:29.790> spin

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
I will go in here and it will spin

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.500 
I will go in here and it will spin
around<00:02:31.489> little<00:02:32.489> fling<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.090> up<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.090> it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
around little fling you up and it's

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.619 
around little fling you up and it's
difficult<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.170> lay<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> Sun<00:02:38.629> basically

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
difficult to lay in the Sun basically

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.240 
difficult to lay in the Sun basically
make<00:02:40.620> holes<00:02:41.129> in<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.489> ground<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
make holes in the ground and then you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.780 
make holes in the ground and then you
put<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.519> triangle<00:02:45.239> on<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.379> on<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> side<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
put a triangle on this on a side on the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.910 
put a triangle on this on a side on the
ice<00:02:48.090> slide<00:02:48.629> you<00:02:48.900> put<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.110> nice<00:02:49.290> triangle<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.829> I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
ice slide you put a nice triangle and I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.280 
ice slide you put a nice triangle and I
side<00:02:50.160> it'll<00:02:50.430> spin<00:02:50.700> around<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.200> have

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
side it'll spin around and then you have

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.030 
side it'll spin around and then you have
to<00:02:52.409> make<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> move<00:02:52.890> around<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.670> fly<00:02:54.030> off<00:02:54.239> oof<00:02:54.510> I

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
to make a move around to fly off oof I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.309 
to make a move around to fly off oof I
can<00:02:56.040> never<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.849> get<00:02:57.030> down<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:58.049> show<00:02:58.260> you

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
can never to get down and just show you
