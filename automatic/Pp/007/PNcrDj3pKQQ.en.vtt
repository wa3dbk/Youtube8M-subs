00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.849
 you will ask why he teaches 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.340
 credits of the game because I wanted that 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.500
 you saw these people I do not know who from 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.720
 they are the culprit but we are from 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.689
 February with problems that two by three 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.820
 with the wow is that it is tired seriously is 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.820
 the third video in a few months that I upload 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.829
 of this does not give error 23 or whatever it is 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.620
 error all now but it's thrown up 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.660
 the forum and I was like this all day until 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.850
 6 o'clock in the afternoon that is from the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.700
 night to night from 3 o'clock at night 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.630
 4 last night until 6 pm 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.820
 about 4 or 6 hours worked fine and come back 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.320
 to throw ourselves less badly than I could not 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.000
 connect before in this video you will see 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.620
 much earlier on my channel but it's that 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 Now when I can finally connect to a 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.080
 Wednesday I have a free time to be able 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.360
 make fat people to do 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.160
 heavenly with all my ninetys and 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.040
 get some equipment before I go to 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.080
 sleep instead of that I get out of the game 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.280
 nothing else I take a flight and nobody of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.810
 we can re-enter now 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.460
 we were in command and complaining about 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.500
 the same thing happened to me all day working 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.759
 in the book that by the way about that already 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.540
 talk in the next chapter of route 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.540
 90 maybe 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.180
 and I wanted a break time I wanted a 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.130
 time to improve my progress a bit 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.690
 the characters now that we have a 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.760
 brotherhood a little more ryder although still 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.580
 you can not see it because cf versus raid 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.430
 he still did not get there 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.430
 this happens to us over yesterday we were in 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.200
 wright in flex 2 and a misunderstanding we are 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.490
 fighting we are in advance in 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.500
 flex 2 to 1 of the entire chew 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.500
 we were against nobody and the cheese did not 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.390
 existed because we have few ranges and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.430
 finally we do everything ideal mechanics 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.840
 perfect we were doing it right 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.900
 as it should be done at 20% it falls half 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.820
 raid fall the two tanks 3 hitleres 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.440
 and several of ps there was only me and another of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.970
 ps I have not fallen but of course if I'm 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.340
 I only the tanks have fallen all 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.530
 they have fallen we have hit because of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.149
 warn 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.039
 I do not know what's happening to them lately 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.720
 I do not know if it's because other people have connected 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.160
 kingdoms and why is it that it has started 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 since they have connected the kingdoms from 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.450
 February they connected they pull hills 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.490
 brown and then they throw me the wanderers are 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.220
 a few months began to pass this shit 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.709
 seriously it is that there is no other or does not try 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.550
 to write it is shit we pay enough 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.300
 pasta every month 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.540
 today I deposit to the bank 70 euros for 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.239
 to spend in six months of bou and it's 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.680
 that is, they take away the desire to spend 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.390
 because fuck 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.070
 pay so much pasta so then maybe 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.620
 the game does not work for you one day and a 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.209
 day not a day if a day not in the middle the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.440
 strip root or when you have a while 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.450
 free to do it whatever it is you 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.040
 pull and we can not do anything good if I 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.830
 I can complain I can record videos what 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.720
 only that I have a small voice in 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.610
 internet I have some subscribers that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.960
 can you hear me can you share or not 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.180
 my opinion but esque 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.180
 I'm sorry for recording so many videos of 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.100
 complaint often but I think that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.230
 if these things happen since we can not 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.480
 do something else the least is to do it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.130
 know the minimum is to make a video if 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.080
 you have a YouTube plan poster or in 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.210
 facebook or where you can so that the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.310
 people see that this can not be is that 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.870
 it can not be all the whole 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.510
 brotherhood is frustrated we have entered 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.060
 books two today because it did not work well 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.770
 the egg we have entered into limbo the two 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.220
 is that it can not be that the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.720
 competition will take away people punctually 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.400
 It looks like it will take away people 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.110
 because apart from that you'll take us out 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.450
 content even within God and you know 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.260
 how many months are you shooting the game 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.720
 every two for three 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.250
 that maybe it's not your fault like that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.920
 our fault some guilt will have 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.720
 fuck can not happen like that because 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.099
 I know no cataclysm occurs or in 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.879
 france or whatever where are the 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.159
 servers that I know are tests that 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.829
 they put them or that someone has touched something 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.420
 wrong and it has fallen I do not know but but it is 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.069
 that does not work that's the only thing that 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.019
 it should work for you and it does not work 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.900
 we pay for a service that we do not know 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.070
 loan 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.810
 there's nothing I can say that no longer 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.340
 I said in my previous two videos 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.110
 of complaint that I would not let you in 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.460
 fuck what piece building because there's no 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.940
 no building on the bus 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.130
 I have already said all my arguments in my 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.790
 two previous videos but it's that in 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.040
 serious that this does not end yesterday that we 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.350
 pull the raid today that will not let 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.140
 play almost nobody and when he lets pass 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.620
 a few hours and throw us again is that it is 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.690
 frustrating is already a game that has 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.130
 quite a budget has many years 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.260
 of experience these things no longer 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.300
 they should pass these heights not even 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.090
 put patches is the same part all the 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.710
 while and these things happen seriously 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.280
 in the end I hope they solve it 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.220
 because we've been two or three months 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.270
 very bad with constant drops with 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.389
 instability is in battle net much 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.600
 people with the complaining of several thousands 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.310
 several seconds of latency not 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.870
 milliseconds in seconds thousands of 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.230
 milliseconds 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.000
 what a holy auto, and it seems to me 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.380
 an embarrassment of this with how much 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.630
 I love the game and how much 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.670
 respect to its creators this seems to me 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.890
 a shame and I think we should 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.040
 do something about it but it's already that if 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.730
 they do not make another gilbert will yes 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.940
 will do 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.560
 cool to be will do it or whoever it is achieves and 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.780
 this rock have to put the batteries 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.880
 is that it is that or do you put the batteries in 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.930
 this world or in the end you're nobody 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.930
 at the end they forget you 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.030
 I do not have much more to say simply 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.220
 I wanted to inform you that again 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.820
 egg as the ass and as I say I 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.170
 I have the option the possibility rather 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.700
 bother but they go out to the art book 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.910
 of the collector's edition I have the 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.380
 option the possibility again of 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.370
 transmit this to a more amount or 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.620
 less high players and my voice is made 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.510
 hear not much not as much as the voices 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.050
 media of big magazines or something 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.660
 well but some media power but if 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.880
 say I have it and I can complain and what 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.160
 I do and that is what they should do 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.740
 Anyone who pays for something and does not 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.110
 he receives it 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.180
 natural complaints are part of the 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.229
 review 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.580
 criticism you will say is not a criticism 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.500
 constructive you are simply 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.940
 complaining is always critical 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.620
 constructive do it better are you 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.639
 doing it wrong doing the best we do not have 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.009
 data why you do it wrong 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.990
 just fix what you have to 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.639
 Fixing the game before was fine because 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.199
 Now it's wrong 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.030
 but well what is said is not much more than 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.159
 say I hope you liked this 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.050
 video a bit strange tomorrow you will have 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.389
 as a contrast a much more video 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.029
 fun and much more enjoyable and then I think 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.969
 that a series that equal some of you 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.439
 waiting a few weeks so nothing 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.789
 I hope you liked it as always 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:52.110
 the likes forito and subscribe to the 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.110
 channel or as it explains
