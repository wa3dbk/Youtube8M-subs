00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
immersion if you're just cruising around

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.100 
immersion if you're just cruising around
in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> car<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.150> wouldn't<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.600> able<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.990> be

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
in the car you wouldn't be able to be

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
in the car you wouldn't be able to be
threatened<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.590> enemies<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.460> just

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
threatened by enemies really you just

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
threatened by enemies really you just
run<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:29.970> over<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> agree<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.560> horses<00:01:32.430> are

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
run them over so I agree that horses are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.109 
run them over so I agree that horses are
a<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.630> happy<00:01:34.200> medium<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:35.030> especially<00:01:36.030> if

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
a good happy medium here especially if

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
a good happy medium here especially if
you<00:01:36.210> take<00:01:36.390> Skyrim<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.869> example<00:01:37.229> where<00:01:37.409> they

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you take Skyrim for example where they

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
you take Skyrim for example where they
do<00:01:37.590> help<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.130> from<00:01:38.310> point<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> point<00:01:38.759> be

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
do help you get from point a to point be

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.630 
do help you get from point a to point be
a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.360> bit<00:01:39.509> faster<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.530> they're<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.159> too

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
a little bit faster but they're not too

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.999 
a little bit faster but they're not too
quick<00:01:41.939> where<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:43.170> almost<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
quick where it's actually almost all the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
quick where it's actually almost all the
time<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.670> solution<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.390> foot<00:01:45.630> but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
time a better solution to go on foot but

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.770 
time a better solution to go on foot but
it's<00:01:46.439> still<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.979> reliable<00:01:47.460> option<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.570> all

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's still a reliable option so on all

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's still a reliable option so on all
horses<00:01:49.110> fall<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.770> yes<00:01:50.159> yes<00:01:50.549> ok<00:01:51.149> moving<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
horses fall for yes yes ok moving on to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
everybody I feel like stealth should be

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.420 
everybody I feel like stealth should be
more<00:03:24.419> of<00:03:24.540> an<00:03:24.629> option<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.250> Bethesda<00:03:26.250> should

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
more of an option and Bethesda should

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.979 
more of an option and Bethesda should
work<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:26.849> role<00:03:27.060> design<00:03:27.359> for<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.720> type<00:03:27.959> of

work on the role design for that type of

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.720 
work on the role design for that type of
scenario<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.220> prior<00:03:29.459> to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
scenario because it's not like prior to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.039 
scenario because it's not like prior to
this<00:03:29.819> their<00:03:30.030> world<00:03:30.209> design<00:03:30.480> was<00:03:30.660> bad<00:03:30.840> or

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
this their world design was bad or

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
naturally I've always felt that this the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.520 
naturally I've always felt that this the

I<00:04:12.419> feel<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:12.810> there<00:04:12.989> should<00:04:13.019> be<00:04:13.229> some<00:04:13.440> type<00:04:13.590> of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
I feel like there should be some type of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.520 
I feel like there should be some type of
risk<00:04:13.919> reward<00:04:14.220> factor<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.479> way<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.049> always

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
risk reward factor and the way I always

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.890 
risk reward factor and the way I always
introduce<00:04:17.159> that<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.699> kind<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.510> similar<00:04:18.659> to

introduce that is a kind of similar to

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.719 
introduce that is a kind of similar to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200 
different there in a different area I
feel<00:04:23.789> like<00:04:23.969> if<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.270> fall<00:04:24.510> asleep

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
feel like if you fall asleep

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.850 
feel like if you fall asleep
you're<00:04:25.569> gonna<00:04:25.690> wake<00:04:25.990> up<00:04:26.020> somewhere<00:04:26.680> else

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
you're gonna wake up somewhere else

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.409 
you're gonna wake up somewhere else
you're<00:04:27.039> gonna<00:04:27.160> wake<00:04:27.400> up<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.729> bandit<00:04:28.150> camp

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
you're gonna wake up in a bandit camp

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.779 
you're gonna wake up in a bandit camp
you're<00:04:29.199> gonna<00:04:29.319> wake<00:04:29.590> up<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.250> trash<00:04:30.550> you

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
you're gonna wake up in the trash you

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.580 
you're gonna wake up in the trash you
know<00:04:30.880> you're<00:04:31.120> gonna<00:04:31.240> wake<00:04:31.509> up<00:04:31.539> some<00:04:32.350> what<00:04:32.500> are

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
know you're gonna wake up some what are

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.870 
know you're gonna wake up some what are
different<00:04:32.919> I<00:04:33.039> think<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.580> would<00:04:33.699> be<00:04:33.759> really

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
different I think that would be really

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.629 
different I think that would be really
cool<00:04:34.539> but<00:04:35.530> that's<00:04:35.650> if<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:36.009> just<00:04:36.220> sleep<00:04:36.400> out<00:04:36.610> in

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
cool but that's if you just sleep out in

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.980 
cool but that's if you just sleep out in
the<00:04:36.819> middle<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.150> waistline<00:04:37.449> if<00:04:37.569> you<00:04:37.690> sleep

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
the middle of the waistline if you sleep

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.650 
the middle of the waistline if you sleep
in<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.349> allied<00:04:38.800> camp<00:04:39.160> if<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:39.490> sleep<00:04:39.789> somewhere

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
in a allied camp if you sleep somewhere

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.749 
in a allied camp if you sleep somewhere
safe<00:04:41.080> or<00:04:41.380> somewhat<00:04:41.800> are<00:04:41.889> very<00:04:42.220> well<00:04:42.490> hidden

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
safe or somewhat are very well hidden

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.700 
safe or somewhat are very well hidden
then<00:04:43.389> you'll<00:04:43.569> be<00:04:43.630> fine<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.289> feel<00:04:44.500> like<00:04:44.530> if

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
then you'll be fine but I feel like if

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.960 
then you'll be fine but I feel like if
you're<00:04:44.860> just<00:04:44.979> gonna<00:04:45.099> go<00:04:45.310> ahead<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.490> just<00:04:45.669> plop

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
you're just gonna go ahead and just plop

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.249 
you're just gonna go ahead and just plop
the<00:04:46.120> sleeping<00:04:46.449> bag<00:04:46.599> now<00:04:46.780> in<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.960> middle<00:04:47.139> the

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
the sleeping bag now in the middle the

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.200 
the sleeping bag now in the middle the
waistline<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:48.099> should<00:04:48.280> be<00:04:48.400> punished<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:49.000> some

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
waistline you should be punished to some

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.150 
waistline you should be punished to some
degree<00:04:49.389> I'm<00:04:49.780> not<00:04:50.319> in<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.560> way<00:04:50.710> where<00:04:50.979> it's

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
degree I'm not in the way where it's

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.860 
degree I'm not in the way where it's
like<00:04:51.370> oh<00:04:51.520> damn<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.120> know<00:04:52.210> they<00:04:52.330> took<00:04:52.539> all<00:04:52.690> my

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
like oh damn you know they took all my

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.960 
like oh damn you know they took all my
stuff<00:04:53.229> but<00:04:54.009> actually<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:54.400> would<00:04:54.669> kind<00:04:54.910> of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
stuff but actually that would kind of

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.040 
stuff but actually that would kind of
work<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.389> know<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.539> gotta<00:04:55.810> have<00:04:55.960> to

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
work you know you gotta have to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.350 
work you know you gotta have to
stealthily<00:04:56.860> work<00:04:57.280> your<00:04:57.430> way<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.639> like<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.940> chest

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
stealthily work your way to like a chest

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.089 
stealthily work your way to like a chest
and<00:04:58.660> throughout<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.080> camp<00:04:59.410> get<00:04:59.650> your<00:04:59.800> stuff

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
and throughout the camp get your stuff

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.129 
and throughout the camp get your stuff
back<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.370> kind<00:05:00.669> of<00:05:00.789> just<00:05:00.970> rain<00:05:01.539> hell<00:05:01.810> on<00:05:01.840> the

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
back and kind of just rain hell on the

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.480 
back and kind of just rain hell on the
camp<00:05:02.349> I<00:05:02.530> think<00:05:02.889> that<00:05:03.009> would<00:05:03.070> be<00:05:03.160> really<00:05:03.190> cool

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
camp I think that would be really cool

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.089 
camp I think that would be really cool
but<00:05:04.449> like<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.690> said<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.259> sleeping<00:05:05.830> bag<00:05:05.949> is

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
but like I said the the sleeping bag is

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.089 
but like I said the the sleeping bag is
a<00:05:06.130> great<00:05:06.340> idea<00:05:06.639> as<00:05:07.389> is<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.990> campfire<00:05:08.500> idea<00:05:08.919> I

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
really like that he included that but

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.450 
really like that he included that but
