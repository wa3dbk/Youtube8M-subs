00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 Hello everyone, today we talk about this 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.119
 notebook produced by the Italian iter Ã¨ 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.789
 a desktop replacement with screen from 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.930
 15.6 inches which has the peculiarity of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.630
 to be able to replace memory hard disk but 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.450
 especially the processor the manufacturer 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 he sent it with components that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 trade can also be found 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.140
 they are a traditional hard drive an ssd 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 two memory modules and between the processors 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 now we show you how to do it to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.379
 replace them 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.320
 then the first thing to do is remove 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:55.550
 the battery after which we must 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.550
 remove the door 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.110
 at this point we remove the system of 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.180
 dissipation paying attention not to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.590
 explain on the motherboard and to our pa 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.020
 revenues where the processor and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.820
 the gpu there are the thermal pet that al 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.010
 moment they are covered by films that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.210
 will be removed 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.350
 this is the socket where we will go to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.720
 install the processor 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.580
 these are the two sockets for the same number 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.850
 memory modules while this is the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.940
 compartment for the 2.5-inch hard disk 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.080
 let's install the processor now 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.030
 to pay attention to does 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.040
 match the angle marked on 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.729
 processor with the beveled corner up 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 socket 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.050
 the processor must enter alone in the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.110
 socket should not be forced 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.750
 otherwise it will twist into the feet after that 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.729
 just use a torx screwdriver a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.229
 slotted screwdriver of size 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.759
 correct to go to close socket 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.560
 in this way the processor installed 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.540
 after removing the film from the pid 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.330
 thermal we install the system of 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.590
 dissipation just reposition it 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.590
 exactly as it was before 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.659
 we now install the memory modules 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.970
 the installation is very simple enough 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:46.000
 match the cut on the form 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:48.670
 with the groove on the socket yes 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:59.349
 pushes inwards and lowers to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:03:01.780
 module after installing the support 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.220
 to cushion the vibrations we proceed 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.220
 with the installation of the hard disk 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.299
 in this case we have installed 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.310
 but an ssd installation is 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.689
 also identical for a hard drive 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.359
 traditional 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.079
 the important thing is to match the connector 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.030
 sata 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.109
 then push slightly up to 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.150
 end of run 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.609
 installation completed now you can 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.260
 proceed to close the door e 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.260
 put the battery back in place 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.150
 installation completed now you can 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.760
 proceed with the installation of 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.010
 operating system and software in the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.620
 next days we will do all the tests 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.780
 with different hard disk processors e 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.850
 memories that producer sent us 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.930
 reliance on tom's hardware for the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.709
 full review 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.709
 Hi everyone
