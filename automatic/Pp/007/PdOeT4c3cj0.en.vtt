three movies anyway that was my prime

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.940 
three movies anyway that was my prime
motive<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.990> everything<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.500> did<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
motive so everything I did was to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
motive so everything I did was to
protect<00:02:08.220> myself<00:02:08.460> in<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> could

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
protect myself in a way that I could

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.500 
protect myself in a way that I could
actually<00:02:09.630> get<00:02:09.840> those<00:02:10.050> three<00:02:10.259> movies<00:02:10.530> made<00:02:17.510> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
actually get those three movies made of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.260 
actually get those three movies made of
Santa<00:02:18.870> menace<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.460> subsequent<00:02:20.880> two

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
Santa menace and the subsequent two

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.820 
Santa menace and the subsequent two
movies<00:02:21.570> were<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.970> backstory<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.530> episodes<00:02:25.530> 4

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
movies were the backstory for episodes 4

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.130 
movies were the backstory for episodes 4
5<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> 6<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.480> wasn't<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:28.050> to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
5 and 6 and because I wasn't going to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.020 
5 and 6 and because I wasn't going to
make<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.290> into<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> movie<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:29.010> didn't<00:02:29.700> write<00:02:30.000> it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
make it into a movie I didn't write it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.780 
make it into a movie I didn't write it
in<00:02:30.330> order<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.840> fit<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.260> technology<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.520> if<00:02:32.670> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
in order to fit the technology so if it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.610 
in order to fit the technology so if it
couldn't<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.180> made<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.500> had

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
couldn't be made and now that we had

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.500 
couldn't be made and now that we had
developed<00:02:34.740> digital<00:02:35.130> technology<00:02:35.880> by<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
developed digital technology by that

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.350 
developed digital technology by that
time<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.620> free<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.190> basically<00:02:39.120> do

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
time and I was free to basically do

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.110 
time and I was free to basically do
anything<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.930> wanted<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.500> was<00:02:40.890> able<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.520> go<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
anything I wanted I was able to go to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.060 
anything I wanted I was able to go to
places<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.840> already<00:02:42.990> talked<00:02:43.500> about<00:02:43.680> in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
places that we already talked about in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.190 
places that we already talked about in
the<00:02:44.130> last<00:02:44.790> three<00:02:45.120> movies<00:02:45.270> khurasan<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the last three movies khurasan the

the last three movies khurasan the
capital<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.370> fact<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.700> they're<00:02:47.880> aliens

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
capital and the fact that they're aliens

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000 
capital and the fact that they're aliens
everywhere<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.170> all<00:02:49.410> those<00:02:49.590> kind<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.860> things

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
everywhere and all those kind of things

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.560 
everywhere and all those kind of things
that<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.280> had<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.520> put<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.880> little<00:02:51.030> tiny<00:02:51.270> bar

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that I had to put in a little tiny bar

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
that I had to put in a little tiny bar
that<00:02:51.870> was<00:02:51.930> very<00:02:52.110> controlled<00:02:52.830> now<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> could

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that was very controlled now I could

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.100 
that was very controlled now I could
open<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.239> world<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.780> aliens

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
open up the world and have aliens

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.820 
open up the world and have aliens
everywhere<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:56.510> love<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.660> story<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.530> love

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
everywhere I love the story and I love

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.410 
everywhere I love the story and I love
the<00:02:59.010> fact<00:02:59.040> i<00:02:59.340> was<00:02:59.489> able<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.820> tell<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> entire

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the fact i was able to tell the entire

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.420 
the fact i was able to tell the entire
story<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.959> darth<00:03:01.140> vader<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.310> it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
story of darth vader and I think it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.370 
story of darth vader and I think it
really<00:03:02.459> rounds<00:03:03.209> out<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.660> whole<00:03:03.840> series<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
really rounds out the whole series and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.320 
really rounds out the whole series and
tells<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.070> full<00:03:05.250> story<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:05.850> happened

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
I think mm-hmm what does that got to do

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.630 
I think mm-hmm what does that got to do
with<00:03:23.370> anything<00:03:24.530> everything

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640

things that were half finished in the

first three films the second three
there's<00:03:56.160> very<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.880> because<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.840> the

there's very little that because of the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.420 
there's very little that because of the
fact<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.350> had<00:03:58.530> more<00:03:58.709> time<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.130> more<00:03:59.220> money

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
fact that I had more time and more money

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.250 
fact that I had more time and more money
and<00:03:59.610> more<00:03:59.670> technology<00:03:59.970> there<00:04:00.930> are<00:04:01.020> very<00:04:01.200> few

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
and more technology there are very few

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.680 
and more technology there are very few
things<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.830> actually<00:04:02.070> were<00:04:02.370> left<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.970> work

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
things that actually were left to work

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.710 
things that actually were left to work
on<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.170> improve<00:04:04.650> one<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.610> them<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.420> we<00:04:06.540> did

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
on and improve one of them that we did

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.090 
on and improve one of them that we did
improve<00:04:07.080> was<00:04:07.350> what<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.709> were<00:04:07.830> trying

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
improve was what we were trying

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.790 
improve was what we were trying
desperately<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.790> get<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.180> digital<00:04:09.420> Yoda<00:04:09.900> into

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
desperately to get a digital Yoda into

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.699 
desperately to get a digital Yoda into
the<00:04:10.890> first<00:04:11.130> film<00:04:11.760> pana<00:04:12.150> menace<00:04:12.540> we<00:04:13.140> just

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
the first film pana menace we just

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.310 
the first film pana menace we just
couldn't<00:04:14.130> make<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.430> work<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.450> we<00:04:15.900> came<00:04:16.049> close

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
couldn't make it work so we came close

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.069 
couldn't make it work so we came close
we<00:04:16.680> got<00:04:16.799> jar<00:04:17.100> jar<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.579> Sebulba<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.299> waddle

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
we got jar jar and Sebulba and waddle

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.479 
we got jar jar and Sebulba and waddle
and<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.380> lot<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.560> other<00:04:19.739> characters<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:20.370> we

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and a lot of other characters but we

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.490 
and a lot of other characters but we
couldn't<00:04:20.760> get<00:04:20.850> Yoda<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.989> was<00:04:22.320> much

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
couldn't get Yoda because it was much

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.040 
couldn't get Yoda because it was much
harder<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.919> do<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.180> when<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.450> finally<00:04:24.690> did

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
harder to do and so when we finally did

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.540 
harder to do and so when we finally did
get<00:04:25.200> it<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.530> accomplished<00:04:26.100> which<00:04:26.400> was

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
get it that accomplished which was

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.580 
get it that accomplished which was
before<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.060> second<00:04:27.419> film<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:28.140> went<00:04:28.320> back<00:04:28.560> and

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
before the second film we went back and

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.470 
before the second film we went back and
put<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.220> digital<00:04:29.580> Yoda<00:04:29.820> back<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.270> first

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
put the digital Yoda back in the first

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.719 
put the digital Yoda back in the first
film<00:04:30.720> as<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.320> was<00:04:31.440> intended<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:32.100> may<00:04:32.669> the

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
film as it was intended to be may the

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.740 
film as it was intended to be may the
force<00:04:33.090> be<00:04:33.180> with<00:04:33.570> you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.930 

the<00:04:38.260> second<00:04:38.590> trilogy<00:04:38.710> was<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.130> lot<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.430> fun<00:04:39.610> it

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
the second trilogy was a lot of fun it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.400 
the second trilogy was a lot of fun it
was<00:04:40.120> challenging<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.840> that<00:04:40.930> we<00:04:41.020> were<00:04:41.140> pushing

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
was challenging and that we were pushing

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.530 
was challenging and that we were pushing
the<00:04:41.620> boundaries<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:42.040> technology<00:04:42.700> but<00:04:42.880> that

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
the boundaries of technology but that

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.210 
the boundaries of technology but that
was<00:04:43.660> exciting<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.290> mean<00:04:44.530> we<00:04:44.680> were<00:04:44.770> doing<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.040> lot

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
was exciting I mean we were doing a lot

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.650 
was exciting I mean we were doing a lot
of<00:04:45.280> things<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.760> could<00:04:46.060> never<00:04:46.240> be<00:04:46.360> done

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
of things that could never be done

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.100 
of things that could never be done
before<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.550> moving<00:04:48.550> into<00:04:48.790> areas<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.180> we

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
before and moving into areas that we

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.870 
before and moving into areas that we
didn't<00:04:50.380> know<00:04:50.440> where<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:50.710> were<00:04:50.890> what<00:04:51.460> was<00:04:51.610> going

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
didn't know where we were what was going

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.090 
didn't know where we were what was going
on<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.840> was<00:04:53.020> fun<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.380> was<00:04:53.440> exciting<00:04:53.980> it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
on and that was fun it was exciting it

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:08.860 
on and that was fun it was exciting it
was<00:04:54.280> like<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.750> exploration<00:04:55.750> of<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.380> unknown

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.150 

I<00:05:10.180> was<00:05:11.180> trying<00:05:11.630> to<00:05:11.750> get<00:05:12.080> digital<00:05:12.530> projectors

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
I was trying to get digital projectors

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.580 
I was trying to get digital projectors
into<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.580> theaters<00:05:13.970> Bob<00:05:14.330> Zemeckis<00:05:14.660> and<00:05:14.990> Jim

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
into the theaters Bob Zemeckis and Jim

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.190 
into the theaters Bob Zemeckis and Jim

Cameron came and said look we want to

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.670 
Cameron came and said look we want to
get<00:05:18.380> 3d<00:05:19.130> into<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:19.970> theaters<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:20.630> now<00:05:21.440> that

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
get 3d into the theaters and now that

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.890 
get 3d into the theaters and now that
you've<00:05:21.830> got<00:05:22.130> digital<00:05:22.940> theaters<00:05:23.600> we<00:05:23.780> can

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
you've got digital theaters we can

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.100 
you've got digital theaters we can
actually<00:05:24.140> do<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.350> would<00:05:25.070> you<00:05:25.220> join<00:05:25.430> us<00:05:25.490> in

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
actually do that would you join us in

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.060 
actually do that would you join us in
showing<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.290> theater<00:05:27.560> owners<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:27.920> can

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
showing the theater owners that you can

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.580 
showing the theater owners that you can
do<00:05:28.190> 3d<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.910> I<00:05:29.750> said<00:05:29.990> well<00:05:30.170> that'd<00:05:30.320> be<00:05:30.440> good

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
do 3d and I said well that'd be good

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.770 
do 3d and I said well that'd be good
because<00:05:30.800> in<00:05:31.160> order<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.700> do<00:05:31.880> 3d<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:32.450> have<00:05:32.630> to

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
because in order to do 3d you have to

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.390 
because in order to do 3d you have to
have<00:05:32.870> digital<00:05:33.200> theaters<00:05:33.590> so<00:05:34.130> it<00:05:34.250> would

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
have digital theaters so it would

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.520 
have digital theaters so it would
promote<00:05:34.910> my<00:05:35.150> idea<00:05:35.540> of<00:05:35.600> digital<00:05:36.020> theaters<00:05:36.350> but

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
promote my idea of digital theaters but

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.220 
promote my idea of digital theaters but
then<00:05:37.490> when<00:05:37.640> I<00:05:37.670> saw<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.420> test<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:38.900> we<00:05:39.020> did

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
then when I saw the test that we did

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.290 
then when I saw the test that we did
which<00:05:39.410> is<00:05:39.440> about<00:05:39.740> five<00:05:40.010> minutes<00:05:40.250> long<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.790> star

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
which is about five minutes long a star

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.080 
which is about five minutes long a star
wars<00:05:41.540> in<00:05:41.720> 3d<00:05:41.750> I<00:05:42.440> realize<00:05:43.310> how<00:05:43.520> great<00:05:43.700> it<00:05:43.940> was

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
wars in 3d I realize how great it was

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.280 
wars in 3d I realize how great it was
and<00:05:44.150> how<00:05:44.450> great<00:05:44.630> it<00:05:44.750> looked<00:05:46.330> by<00:05:47.330> watching<00:05:48.050> a

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
and how great it looked by watching a

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.500 
and how great it looked by watching a
film<00:05:48.410> in<00:05:48.590> 3d<00:05:48.740> it's<00:05:49.010> hard<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:49.340> explain<00:05:49.550> it's<00:05:50.330> the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
film in 3d it's hard to explain it's the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.060 
film in 3d it's hard to explain it's the
difference<00:05:50.810> between<00:05:50.870> watching<00:05:51.590> a<00:05:51.650> film<00:05:51.770> black

just feel that they're more realistic

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.850 
just feel that they're more realistic
you<00:06:02.600> actually<00:06:02.900> take<00:06:03.080> up<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.380> real<00:06:03.560> space

fish I believe very strongly with 3d
that<00:06:25.100> I<00:06:25.280> don't<00:06:25.790> like<00:06:26.030> the<00:06:26.210> gimmick<00:06:26.540> part<00:06:26.810> of<00:06:26.930> it

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
that I don't like the gimmick part of it

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.230 
that I don't like the gimmick part of it
I<00:06:27.200> don't<00:06:27.830> like<00:06:27.890> things<00:06:28.220> coming<00:06:28.790> out<00:06:28.880> into<00:06:29.090> the

I don't like things coming out into the

the<00:06:31.100> proscenium<00:06:31.430> I<00:06:31.670> think<00:06:31.880> that's<00:06:32.060> where<00:06:32.180> the

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
the proscenium I think that's where the

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.630 
the proscenium I think that's where the
real<00:06:32.330> advantage<00:06:33.170> of<00:06:33.350> 3d<00:06:33.710> is<00:06:33.920> it<00:06:34.250> just<00:06:34.400> makes<00:06:34.550> a

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
real advantage of 3d is it just makes a

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.280 
real advantage of 3d is it just makes a
much<00:06:34.880> better<00:06:35.300> experience<00:06:35.600> out<00:06:36.500> of<00:06:36.620> it<00:06:37.930> 3d<00:06:38.930> and

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
much better experience out of it 3d and

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.370 
much better experience out of it 3d and
conversion<00:06:39.920> of<00:06:40.010> 3d<00:06:40.430> is<00:06:40.730> not<00:06:41.060> a<00:06:41.380> technical

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
conversion of 3d is not a technical

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.380 
conversion of 3d is not a technical
thing<00:06:42.590> it's<00:06:43.220> an<00:06:43.310> art<00:06:43.520> that<00:06:43.700> you<00:06:43.790> need<00:06:43.940> artists

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
thing it's an art that you need artists

for<00:06:44.540> we<00:06:45.080> had<00:06:45.320> an<00:06:45.500> advantage<00:06:45.830> which<00:06:46.280> most

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
for we had an advantage which most

people who try to do conversions don't
