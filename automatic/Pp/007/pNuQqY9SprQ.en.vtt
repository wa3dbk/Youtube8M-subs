out<00:00:35.710> for<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:36.800> glitch<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.220> would<00:00:37.460> strongly

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
out for this glitch I would strongly

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.910 
out for this glitch I would strongly
recommend<00:00:37.970> doing<00:00:38.600> this<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:38.989> carrier<00:00:39.440> or<00:00:39.710> in

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
recommend doing this on carrier or in

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.920 
recommend doing this on carrier or in
Yemen<00:00:40.400> as<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.030> glitch<00:00:41.210> is<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.720> most

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
Yemen as the glitch is the most

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.340 
Yemen as the glitch is the most
effective<00:00:42.710> on<00:00:42.830> those<00:00:43.010> maps<00:00:43.540> for<00:00:44.540> this<00:00:44.690> you're

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
effective on those maps for this you're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.930 
effective on those maps for this you're
going<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.860> need<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.040> have<00:00:46.220> a<00:00:46.489> tactical

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
going to need to have a tactical

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.390 
going to need to have a tactical
insertion<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:47.900> then<00:00:48.710> go<00:00:48.890> anywhere<00:00:49.280> on

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
insertion and then go anywhere on

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.799 
insertion and then go anywhere on
carrier<00:00:49.820> where<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.239> would<00:00:50.390> fall<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.629> your

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
carrier where you would fall to your

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.439 
carrier where you would fall to your
death<00:00:50.900> in<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.350> water<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.830> then<00:00:52.550> place<00:00:53.420> your

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
death in the water and then place your

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.079 
death in the water and then place your
tech<00:00:53.780> as<00:00:53.989> far<00:00:54.290> as<00:00:54.530> possible<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:55.790> when<00:00:56.000> you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
tech as far as possible so when you

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.770 
tech as far as possible so when you
spawn<00:00:56.420> you'll<00:00:57.350> be<00:00:57.589> on<00:00:57.799> air<00:00:58.330> now<00:00:59.330> if<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.629> did

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
spawn you'll be on air now if you did

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.750 
spawn you'll be on air now if you did
this<00:00:59.839> correctly<00:01:00.049> you<00:01:00.500> will<00:01:00.650> keep<00:01:01.250> falling

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
this correctly you will keep falling

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.329 
this correctly you will keep falling
slowly<00:01:02.239> for<00:01:03.140> about<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.320> couple<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:03.830> minutes<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
slowly for about a couple of minutes and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.219 
slowly for about a couple of minutes and
you<00:01:04.699> can<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.420> know<00:01:05.510> some<00:01:05.900> parts<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.170> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
you can see you know some parts of the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.340 
you can see you know some parts of the
boats<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:08.450> know<00:01:08.540> some<00:01:08.869> other<00:01:08.930> things

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
boats and you know some other things

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.560 
boats and you know some other things
while<00:01:09.799> slowly<00:01:10.159> going<00:01:10.490> down<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:11.060> pretty<00:01:11.299> cool

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
while slowly going down it's pretty cool

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.710 
while slowly going down it's pretty cool
and<00:01:12.070> like<00:01:13.070> i<00:01:13.250> said<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:13.549> also<00:01:13.880> works<00:01:14.150> on<00:01:14.330> Yemen

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
and like i said this also works on Yemen

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.550 
and like i said this also works on Yemen
it<00:01:14.869> works<00:01:15.020> on<00:01:15.170> all<00:01:15.350> maps<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.700> works<00:01:16.939> most

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
it works on all maps but it works most

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.039 
it works on all maps but it works most
best<00:01:18.560> on<00:01:18.799> those<00:01:18.979> two<00:01:19.159> maps<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.210> what<00:01:20.659> this

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
best on those two maps so what this

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.410 
best on those two maps so what this
glitch<00:01:21.740> may<00:01:22.220> be<00:01:22.280> tricky<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.939> took<00:01:23.090> me<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.270> while

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
glitch may be tricky it took me a while

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.529 
glitch may be tricky it took me a while
to<00:01:23.479> get<00:01:23.810> because<00:01:24.170> if<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.490> tech<00:01:25.729> isn't<00:01:26.030> as<00:01:26.330> far

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
to get because if the tech isn't as far

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.300 
to get because if the tech isn't as far
as<00:01:26.689> possible<00:01:27.200> it'll<00:01:27.799> just<00:01:27.979> keep<00:01:28.100> some

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
as possible it'll just keep some

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.999 
as possible it'll just keep some
spawning<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.969> then<00:01:29.719> if<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.409> know<00:01:30.710> it's<00:01:30.859> kind

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
spawning and then if you know it's kind

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.649 
spawning and then if you know it's kind
of<00:01:31.100> frustrating<00:01:31.280> you'll<00:01:31.670> either<00:01:31.880> die<00:01:32.149> but

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
of frustrating you'll either die but

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.959 
of frustrating you'll either die but
once<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.380> get<00:01:33.590> your<00:01:33.710> tech<00:01:33.950> as<00:01:34.219> far<00:01:34.820> as

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
once you get your tech as far as

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.719 
once you get your tech as far as
possible<00:01:35.829> towards<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.070> know<00:01:37.189> how<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.549> map

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
possible towards you know how to the map

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.499 
possible towards you know how to the map
and<00:01:37.999> you<00:01:38.030> spawn<00:01:38.929> its<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.310> easy<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.479> I

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
and you spawn its it's that easy so I
