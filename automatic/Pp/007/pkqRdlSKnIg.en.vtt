00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.800
 talk about how to use 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.410
 submarine and where to find her where her 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.560
 get like then swim on it and so 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.310
 further first to use it 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.769
 need to buy a house but before that you need 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 complete mission mission called 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.000
 robbery world lake 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.010
 difficult name is 30 mission account 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.079
 after that we can use 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 submarine but just so you don't 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.100
 take advantage because it does not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.520
 attributed to water is very difficult to Well 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.829
 impossible to understand and we need a house where 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.289
 going directly to the water 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.050
 directly to the ocean is home 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.360

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.289
 it costs 150 thousand or 250 now we 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.860
 we will run up and find out exactly 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.960
 nice view here is nice even to run and 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.150
 besides submarines there are boats 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 for diving more precisely it will stand 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.700
 there a little further if you open it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.619
 well gradual anyway open and then 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 and another he pit what nigga sits 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.960
 pumped up just an athlete and up to 250 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.600
 thousand worth a house we buy it all 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 our property will tell you the same about 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.909
 the fact that from this building we are now kapu 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.570
 money in your pocket for what we bought it 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.799
 and here is the bathyscaphe we were so eager for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 see the submarine 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.740
 welcome you can try to climb 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.090
 not and and plow the depths of the ocean at the very 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.329
 In fact, it is fun to have an assignment such as 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.280
 collect waste garbage in the ocean there 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:05.310
 Easter eggs in the ocean is a UFO broken lao 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.680
 lies at the bottom of the ocean i have on 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.050
 channel video where I will be more accurate is all 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.670
 tell more precisely 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.070
 I'll show you, let's try 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.890
 if someone doesn't believe that all this 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.750
 you can use the most important thing 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.710
 remember two things you need to buy 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.350
 house muted 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.810
 and pass the mission which I have already called 30 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.350
 on account here will be a little further 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.480
 stand 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.690
 diving boat for now she is not me 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.360
 openly but she will stand right there then 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.580
 there is no look elsewhere again 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.500
 near your house that's all set off 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.010
 see you have a radar 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.800
 This is just the mission of waste collection. 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.590
 I say goodbye to this 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.540
 I hope you were happy to see this 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.030
 tuturial tutorial 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.460
 because I noticed many people ask 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.980
 on the forums and where is the underwater 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 the boat I went through the mission and I know where it is 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.690
 why didnâ€™t I have a submarine 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.820
 boat all float I do not know how 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.530
 on and swim if she stands on the sand she 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.990
 worth it on the sand if not to buy 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.750
 this house she stands at the house 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.630
 there is a hangar in there about his landing 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.260
 strip and it will not budge no 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.350
 push up 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.840
 and here it is automatically transferred to 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.370
 water and you can use it in your 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.370
 pleasure yet
