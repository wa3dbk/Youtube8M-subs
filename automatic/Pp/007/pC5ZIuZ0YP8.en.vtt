00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:05.649
 Hello and welcome to Sunday weather also at Arcachon ManU 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:08.769
 WordPress come there or do UKE 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.179
 Sunday, especially in North Rhine-Westphalia, is really on the horizon 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.939
 open-topped processor scale 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.480
 for this season become very leading in the showcase 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.989
 that's not so great July day, the wild 13 "maybe 14 degrees themselves 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.649
 in the lowlands in north rhine-westphalia 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.759
 together with rain and wind 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.289
 There is also a relatively rare event on the NÃ¼rburgring 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.280
 where you are of course still a bit coarser as the temperatures then 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.620
 barely over 10 degrees in the afternoon and also early in the morning were Sunday 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.190
 the testers at 8 9 degrees going so rather autumnal club is and again with 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.650
 the winter too 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.070
 feels very special after October but it really is 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.570
 to be like this everywhere in Germany 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 that the situation 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.410
 with the sunshine duration and you can see here large parts of the West really 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.420
 almost nothing is nothing 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.909
 a bit Helgoland Sylt over it and then also south 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 on the Upper Rhine at Lake Constance little bit and especially east you are 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.730
 still preferred 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.520
 then it takes part until the evening until it to SID and just immediately 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.470
 or you are then not far from ten hours of sunshine in the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 final settlement 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.710
 according to there on Sunday morning at 8 o'clock the friendliest 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.350
 Conditions with every kilometer to the west and also south 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.960
 more clouds and yet rain with it 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.030
 Generally so, and that will be the whole day in the Lee of the day 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.010
 Low mountain ranges so where it is general bit dryer at strong 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.220
 southwest to west wind there is also the Nordler on Sunday not so 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 far with the remake is always longer dry sections 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.690
 but otherwise especially in the Louvre of the low mountain ranges 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.470
 And even where she can just damn them everywhere Werths frequent rain like 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.660
 also in the Black Forest and this friendly area in the east 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.890
 is then slowly but surely during the day ever smaller and how 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.219
 said when in the northwestern German also in the lowlands in North Rhine-Westphalia 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.169
 at these temperatures 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.879
 this really does not feel like judy-ann over 20 degrees really exists 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.829
 only in eastern Germany 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.040
 where the snowfall limit in the Alps at around 2000 meters so the very high 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.230
 Passes maybe on Sunday just not with summer tires 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.619
 what will feel then 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.440
 that is clearly the wind 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.110
 those are the means binds the gusts are sometimes one to two winds 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.090
 higher so that it is quite noticeable over the free from them further direction 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.830
 North and west otherwise it is mostly the southwestern wind 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.260
 The hope remains, however, that is but from Tuesday slowly but 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.359
 certainly a bit warmer breakthrough direction stable 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.579
 Summer weather, however, still not in sight
