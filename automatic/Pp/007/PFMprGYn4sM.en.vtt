00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay the Belkin transmitter now I have a

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay the Belkin transmitter now I have a
question<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.360> course<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.600> have<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.750> question<00:00:04.080> so

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
question of course I have a question so

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.769 
question of course I have a question so
point<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.339> I'm<00:00:05.910> very<00:00:06.240> sure<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.600> works

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
point of it is I'm very sure it works

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.540 
point of it is I'm very sure it works
because<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.080> did<00:00:07.350> get<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.680> preview<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.309> but<00:00:08.429> we

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
because I did get a preview of it but we

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.549 
because I did get a preview of it but we
will<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> blind<00:00:09.120> test<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.570> work<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.840> out<00:00:09.960> but

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
will do a blind test and work it out but

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.990 
will do a blind test and work it out but
the<00:00:10.710> more<00:00:10.889> important<00:00:11.370> thing<00:00:11.519> right<00:00:11.670> now<00:00:11.730> is

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the more important thing right now is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
the more important thing right now is
that<00:00:12.090> if<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.540> works<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.769> much<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.429> huge

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that if it works how much of a huge

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.220 
that if it works how much of a huge
difference<00:00:15.210> will<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.330> make<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.690> your<00:00:15.809> life

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
difference will it make in your life

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.689 
difference will it make in your life
I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.920> difference<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.340> everyone's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I think it's difference in everyone's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.189 
I think it's difference in everyone's
life<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> simple<00:00:18.390> reason<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.109> know

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
life to the simple reason that you know

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.990 
life to the simple reason that you know
your<00:00:19.380> biggest<00:00:19.800> problem<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> constantly

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
dragging hdmi cables all around your

house trying to connect stuff into
various<00:00:25.050> television<00:00:25.199> if<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> were<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
various television if you were a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
various television if you were a
transmitter<00:00:26.369> which<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.029> able<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.420> do<00:00:27.599> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
transmitter which is able to do that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.179 
transmitter which is able to do that
while<00:00:27.960> hidden<00:00:28.349> away<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> discreet<00:00:29.039> location

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
while hidden away in a discreet location

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.759 
while hidden away in a discreet location
that's<00:00:30.060> fantastic<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.650> think

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
that's fantastic not just that I think

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
that's fantastic not just that I think
also<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.700> put<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.450> television<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
also you put just a television all you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
also you put just a television all you
always<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> stand<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.910> other

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
always have to have a stand with other

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
always have to have a stand with other
things<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.050> physically<00:00:37.469> are

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
things because you physically are

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
things because you physically are
putting<00:00:38.100> HDMI<00:00:38.550> cables<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
putting HDMI cables you have to have a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
putting HDMI cables you have to have a
blu-ray<00:00:40.079> player<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.590> gaming<00:00:40.800> console<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> can

crack the but it's fantastic yes they're
really<00:00:50.399> sure<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.850> comes<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
really sure all this comes down to is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
really sure all this comes down to is
there<00:00:51.780> gonna<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.989> signal<00:00:52.440> loss<00:00:52.620> because

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
there gonna be signal loss because

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
there gonna be signal loss because
especially<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:53.760> doing<00:00:53.940> video<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.420> well

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
especially if you're doing video as well

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.590 
especially if you're doing video as well
and<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.289> say<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.680> 900<00:00:56.280> Mbps<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:57.420> it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and they say it's 900 Mbps now it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.709 
and they say it's 900 Mbps now it's
Wireless<00:00:58.050> N<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> nth<00:00:59.520> degree<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.359> we're

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
Wireless N to the nth degree so we're

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439 
Wireless N to the nth degree so we're
going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> find<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.410> 900<00:01:02.309> Mbps<00:01:03.270> if

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
going to find out about 900 Mbps if

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
going to find out about 900 Mbps if
they're<00:01:03.600> doing<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.619> single<00:01:05.189> pixel

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
they're doing it with not a single pixel

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
they're doing it with not a single pixel
loss<00:01:05.939> which<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.510> claim<00:01:07.200> that's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
loss which is what they claim that's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.630 
loss which is what they claim that's
time<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.830> seen<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.220> there's<00:01:08.369> even

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
time you have seen that if there's even

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880 
time you have seen that if there's even
a<00:01:08.700> pixel<00:01:09.150> loss<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> back<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
a pixel loss then I think you back that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.020 
a pixel loss then I think you back that
housing<00:01:11.280> $500

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
housing $500

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
housing $500
yes<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> prove<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
yes there actually if you can prove that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.240 
yes there actually if you can prove that
there<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> degradation<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> know

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
there is a degradation of this you know

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
there is a degradation of this you know
where's<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> fine<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.229> point

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
where's the fine is there at some point

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
where's the fine is there at some point
it's<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.070> oh<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> walls<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's gonna be oh you know the walls the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
it's gonna be oh you know the walls the
walls<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.619> too<00:01:22.770> thick<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> supposed<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
walls are too thick this is supposed to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
walls are too thick this is supposed to
be<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.060> wooden<00:01:24.420> walls<00:01:27.200> they're<00:01:28.200> say<00:01:28.409> 100<00:01:28.950> feet

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
be for wooden walls they're say 100 feet

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.940 
be for wooden walls they're say 100 feet
but<00:01:29.520> obviously<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.689> distance<00:01:31.320> may<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
but obviously your distance may have a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
but obviously your distance may have a
problem<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.909> gives<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> signal<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
problem but if it gives the signal it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
problem but if it gives the signal it
should<00:01:33.869> give<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.259> perfect<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> won't

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
should give it perfect what it won't

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.499 
should give it perfect what it won't
give<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> signal<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> end<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
give you a signal at all at the end of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
give you a signal at all at the end of
the<00:01:36.570> day<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.020> digital<00:01:37.500> good<00:01:37.860> no<00:01:38.009> no<00:01:38.070> that's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the day it's digital good no no that's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
the day it's digital good no no that's
that's<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.700> exactly<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> case<00:01:39.600> sometimes

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that's not exactly the case sometimes

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
that's not exactly the case sometimes
you<00:01:40.200> could<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> signal<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> signal

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you could get a signal in the signal

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
you could get a signal in the signal
works<00:01:41.820> fine<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> middle<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
works fine but in the middle is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.060 
works fine but in the middle is
deterioration<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:45.509> happens<00:01:46.070> escape

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
deterioration that's what happens escape

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
deterioration that's what happens escape
you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.820> escaped<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you can actually have escaped like I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
you can actually have escaped like I
saying<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.710> line<00:01:49.979> test<00:01:50.430> we're<00:01:50.790> gonna

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
saying the line test we're gonna

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.429 
saying the line test we're gonna
actually<00:01:51.240> run<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> through<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.170> gonna<00:01:52.320> have

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
actually run it through you gonna have

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.749 
actually run it through you gonna have
people<00:01:52.770> come<00:01:52.979> there<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> be

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
people come there it's not going to be

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
people come there it's not going to be
just<00:01:53.970> my<00:01:54.149> eyes<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.600> yours<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.229> have

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
just my eyes or yours I'm gonna have

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
just my eyes or yours I'm gonna have
people<00:01:55.590> who<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:55.950> actually<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.790> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
people who are actually going to do this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
people who are actually going to do this
we<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.479> show<00:01:57.689> them<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> signal<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
we will show them the signal with the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.219 
we will show them the signal with the
blu-ray<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.399> HDMI<00:02:00.149> cable<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.140> will

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
blu-ray and HDMI cable and then we will

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.450 
blu-ray and HDMI cable and then we will
take<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> off<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> put<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.920> through<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
take it off and put it through this and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039 
take it off and put it through this and
they<00:02:02.850> don't<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.180> which<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> which<00:02:03.630> let's<00:02:03.899> see

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
they don't know which is which let's see

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.230 
they don't know which is which let's see
what<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.350> core<00:02:04.590> does<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.969> signal

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
what this core does there is a signal

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.999 
what this core does there is a signal
loss<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.719> 2000<00:02:07.640> Welkin<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:09.739> alright<00:02:10.739> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
loss we get 2000 Welkin right alright so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.730 
loss we get 2000 Welkin right alright so
let's<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.520> try<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.390> whether<00:02:12.660> they<00:02:13.050> is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
let's just try and see whether they is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.650 
let's just try and see whether they is
or<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.580> because<00:02:14.880> there's<00:02:15.060> no<00:02:15.210> denying<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
or not because there's no denying the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.230 
or not because there's no denying the
fact<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.620> works<00:02:16.860> fine<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.670> massive

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
fact if it works fine it's a massive

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:30.410 
fact if it works fine it's a massive
convenience<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.290> question<00:02:19.940> will<00:02:29.360> now<00:02:30.360> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
convenience the question will now you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.330 
convenience the question will now you
know<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> story<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.350> about<00:02:31.710> we've<00:02:32.100> given

know what the story is about we've given
you<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> hint<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.530> down

you a hint but really when you get down

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.070 
you a hint but really when you get down
here<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.460> do<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.850> real<00:02:36.120> life<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
here and do it in real life this is

almost magical but I'm going to start
from<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.480> start<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:41.130> deeply

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
from the start and that is think deeply

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.180 
from the start and that is think deeply
about<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.630> most<00:02:42.900> irritating<00:02:43.590> thing

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
about this the most irritating thing
