00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.060 
just a really quick look at the

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.750 
just a really quick look at the
histogram<00:00:07.650> if<00:00:08.650> you'll<00:00:08.799> go<00:00:09.010> to<00:00:09.190> the<00:00:09.340> right<00:00:09.549> in

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
histogram if you'll go to the right in

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.959 
histogram if you'll go to the right in
Lightroom<00:00:10.299> you'll<00:00:11.230> see<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.559> histogram<00:00:12.129> it's

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
Lightroom you'll see the histogram it's

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.270 
Lightroom you'll see the histogram it's
just<00:00:13.120> a<00:00:13.210> graph<00:00:13.570> that<00:00:13.599> represents<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:15.219> the

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
just a graph that represents all the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.850 
just a graph that represents all the
tones<00:00:15.759> in<00:00:16.119> your<00:00:16.299> image<00:00:16.450> I<00:00:16.840> thought<00:00:17.650> this<00:00:17.770> was

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
tones in your image I thought this was

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.589 
tones in your image I thought this was
quite<00:00:18.130> a<00:00:18.250> good<00:00:18.460> image<00:00:18.670> to<00:00:18.849> start<00:00:19.180> with<00:00:19.420> because

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
quite a good image to start with because

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.200 
quite a good image to start with because
we've<00:00:19.930> got<00:00:20.050> some<00:00:20.200> greys<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.759> can<00:00:21.880> see<00:00:22.119> in

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
we've got some greys as you can see in

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.650 
we've got some greys as you can see in
the<00:00:22.300> background<00:00:23.070> some<00:00:24.070> green<00:00:24.399> there<00:00:24.790> it's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
the background some green there it's

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.170 
the background some green there it's
very<00:00:25.779> average<00:00:26.259> tome<00:00:26.680> and<00:00:27.040> then<00:00:27.939> you've<00:00:28.059> got

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
very average tome and then you've got

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.710 
very average tome and then you've got
highlights<00:00:28.570> in<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.559> watch<00:00:30.239> we<00:00:31.239> zoom<00:00:31.480> in<00:00:31.599> on

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
highlights in the watch we zoom in on

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.720 
highlights in the watch we zoom in on
the<00:00:31.809> watch<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.230> can<00:00:32.380> see<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.649> all<00:00:33.489> these

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
the watch you can see that all these

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.810 
the watch you can see that all these
white<00:00:34.059> highlights<00:00:34.630> are<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.380> right<00:00:36.309> hand<00:00:36.670> side

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
white highlights are the right hand side

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.490 
white highlights are the right hand side
of<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:37.900> histogram<00:00:38.530> in<00:00:38.770> this<00:00:39.010> area<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:40.500> zoom

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
of the histogram in this area and zoom

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.740 
of the histogram in this area and zoom
out<00:00:41.650> again<00:00:42.100> if<00:00:42.940> you're<00:00:43.060> looking<00:00:43.270> for<00:00:43.300> blacks

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
out again if you're looking for blacks

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.570 
out again if you're looking for blacks
we've<00:00:44.050> got<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.200> small<00:00:44.530> peek<00:00:44.860> at<00:00:45.130> the<00:00:45.250> end<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.520> the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
we've got a small peek at the end of the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.580 
we've got a small peek at the end of the
histogram<00:00:46.180> which<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.450> can<00:00:46.600> see<00:00:46.810> is<00:00:46.960> black<00:00:47.290> so

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
histogram which you can see is black so

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.980 
histogram which you can see is black so
you<00:00:47.620> can<00:00:47.860> pick<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.220> buttons<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.880> this<00:00:49.510> area

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
you can pick the buttons is this area

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.160 
you can pick the buttons is this area
that<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:52.480> what<00:00:52.600> you're<00:00:52.720> seen<00:00:52.960> as<00:00:52.990> a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
that is really what you're seen as a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.490 
that is really what you're seen as a
black<00:00:54.660> assuming<00:00:55.660> again<00:00:55.870> he<00:00:56.050> got<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.260> little

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
black assuming again he got a little

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.010 
black assuming again he got a little
bits<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.010> pieces<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.430> black<00:00:57.790> it's<00:00:58.600> mainly<00:00:58.900> the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
bits and pieces of black it's mainly the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.860 
bits and pieces of black it's mainly the
mid-tones<00:00:59.680> on<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.610> look<00:01:00.970> out<00:01:01.090> here<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.540> can<00:01:01.690> see

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
mid-tones on a look out here you can see

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.700 
mid-tones on a look out here you can see
there's<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.140> lot<00:01:02.290> of<00:01:02.320> average<00:01:02.739> mid-tones<00:01:04.710> let

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
there's a lot of average mid-tones let

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.920 
there's a lot of average mid-tones let
me<00:01:05.829> just<00:01:06.299> filter<00:01:07.299> this<00:01:07.420> down<00:01:07.720> I've<00:01:07.899> got

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
me just filter this down I've got

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.010 
me just filter this down I've got
another<00:01:08.320> new<00:01:08.500> image<00:01:08.740> for<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.130> look<00:01:09.340> at<00:01:10.020> in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
another new image for you to look at in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.520 
another new image for you to look at in
here<00:01:11.409> we've<00:01:11.740> got<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:13.420> ninety<00:01:14.050> percent<00:01:14.229> of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
here we've got really ninety percent of

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.240 
here we've got really ninety percent of
the<00:01:14.680> images<00:01:15.190> mid<00:01:16.180> grey<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.830> look<00:01:17.979> over<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
the images mid grey if you look over to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.789 
the images mid grey if you look over to
your<00:01:18.370> histogram<00:01:18.760> you<00:01:19.270> can<00:01:19.450> see<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.770> that

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
your histogram you can see that that

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.120 
your histogram you can see that that
area<00:01:21.670> is<00:01:22.000> all<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.930> information<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.620> is<00:01:23.860> mid

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
area is all the information that is mid

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.789 
area is all the information that is mid
grey<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.750> can<00:01:25.930> then<00:01:26.049> go<00:01:26.229> looking<00:01:26.560> for<00:01:26.590> your

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
grey you can then go looking for your

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.960 
grey you can then go looking for your
highlights<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.260> can<00:01:29.380> see<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:30.010> highlight

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
highlights as you can see a highlight

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.770 
highlights as you can see a highlight
isn't<00:01:31.450> quite<00:01:31.690> there<00:01:31.930> with<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.380> one<00:01:33.780> I've

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
isn't quite there with that one I've

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.480 
isn't quite there with that one I've
just<00:01:34.960> come<00:01:35.110> over<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.890> develop<00:01:36.340> module

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
just come over to the develop module

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.200 
just come over to the develop module
just<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.060> show<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.299> quickly<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:39.729> area

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
just to show you quickly that this area

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.870 
just to show you quickly that this area
we<00:01:40.479> think<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.140> main<00:01:41.320> highlight<00:01:41.860> but<00:01:42.250> if<00:01:42.610> we

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
we think is the main highlight but if we

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.530 
we think is the main highlight but if we
just<00:01:43.030> toggle<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:44.200> arrow<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.880> triangle

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
just toggle this arrow a triangle

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.480 
just toggle this arrow a triangle
in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.750> top<00:01:46.990> right-hand<00:01:47.229> side<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.710> histogram

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
in the top right-hand side of histogram

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.910 
in the top right-hand side of histogram
you'll<00:01:49.390> notice<00:01:49.720> let<00:01:50.260> me<00:01:50.409> just<00:01:50.619> take<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
you'll notice let me just take the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
you'll notice let me just take the
recovery<00:01:51.159> off<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.950> showing<00:01:54.340> that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
recovery off that that is showing that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.450 
recovery off that that is showing that
detail<00:01:55.990> has<00:01:56.170> been<00:01:56.200> lost<00:01:56.710> it's<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.040> bit<00:01:57.189> like<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
detail has been lost it's a bit like the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.899 
detail has been lost it's a bit like the
flashing<00:01:57.970> area<00:01:58.330> on<00:01:59.320> your<00:01:59.380> camera<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.130> when

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
flashing area on your camera and when

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.340 
flashing area on your camera and when
you<00:02:01.000> look<00:02:01.030> at<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.270> histogram<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.200> look

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
you look at the histogram and you look

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.100 
you look at the histogram and you look
at<00:02:02.439> your<00:02:02.500> image<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.700> flashing<00:02:04.119> she's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
at your image and it's flashing she's

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.800 
at your image and it's flashing she's
just<00:02:05.170> telling<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.820> you've<00:02:07.030> lost<00:02:07.240> detail

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
just telling you so you've lost detail

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.690 
just telling you so you've lost detail
but<00:02:08.379> you<00:02:08.500> haven't<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.159> is<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> raw

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
but you haven't because this is a raw
