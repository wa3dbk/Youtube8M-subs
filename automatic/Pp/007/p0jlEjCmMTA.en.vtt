00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.300 
don't immediately intervene in Iraq
there<00:05:39.000> will<00:05:39.210> be<00:05:39.419> a<00:05:39.599> global<00:05:40.349> catastrophe<00:05:40.680> and

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
there will be a global catastrophe and

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.070 
there will be a global catastrophe and
maybe<00:05:41.880> there's<00:05:42.180> chemical<00:05:42.720> weapons

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
maybe there's chemical weapons

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.900 
maybe there's chemical weapons
stockpiles<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.919> this<00:05:44.070> group<00:05:44.310> is<00:05:44.520> compiling

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.060 
stockpiles that this group is compiling
right<00:05:45.270> now<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:45.750> then<00:05:46.289> what<00:05:46.470> could<00:05:46.620> happen<00:05:46.770> is

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
right now and then what could happen is

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.850 
right now and then what could happen is
the<00:05:47.400> New<00:05:47.580> York<00:05:47.760> Times<00:05:47.820> can<00:05:48.330> rehire<00:05:48.810> me<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:49.349> I

and then he could just go on TV again
then<00:05:55.919> we<00:05:55.979> could<00:05:56.099> change<00:05:56.340> the<00:05:56.580> constitution

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910
