00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
while you're trying to take it up to the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.020 
while you're trying to take it up to the
breeder<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.659> map<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.490> definitely<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.700> easy

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
breeder this map is definitely not easy

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
breeder this map is definitely not easy
and<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> adds

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and that's a good thing I think it adds

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.359 
and that's a good thing I think it adds
to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.790> replay<00:01:30.150> value<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.829> man<00:01:32.100> because

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to the replay value of this man because

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.550 
to the replay value of this man because
you<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.150> what's<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.420> happen<00:01:33.560> again

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
setting of this map in this Alaskan
laboratory<00:01:52.470> isolated<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> rest<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.820> the

world<00:01:54.380> housing<00:01:55.380> these<00:01:55.649> aliens<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:56.729> it's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
world housing these aliens I think it's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.170 
world housing these aliens I think it's
a<00:01:56.909> pretty<00:01:57.210> cool<00:01:57.570> setting<00:01:58.159> adds<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> story

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
a pretty cool setting adds to the story

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
a pretty cool setting adds to the story
of<00:02:00.420> course<00:02:00.689> also<00:02:00.990> those<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.380> worry<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.890> like

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
of course also those two worry I like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
of course also those two worry I like
probably<00:02:02.340> added<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.700> some<00:02:02.729> story<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
probably added in some story to this it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.520 
probably added in some story to this it
adds<00:02:04.590> some<00:02:05.090> more<00:02:06.090> interest<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:06.990> definitely

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
adds some more interest it's definitely

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.770 
adds some more interest it's definitely
no<00:02:07.649> zombies<00:02:08.220> storyline<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.420> adds<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
no zombies storyline but it adds a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420 
no zombies storyline but it adds a
little<00:02:09.899> bit<00:02:10.080> more<00:02:10.289> interest<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> audio

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
little bit more interest with the audio

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.540 
little bit more interest with the audio
logs<00:02:11.760> with

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
logs with

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.940 
logs with
Intel<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.390> can<00:02:13.510> watch<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.050> these<00:02:14.680> little

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
Intel and you can watch the these little

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.760 
Intel and you can watch the these little
videos<00:02:15.130> after<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.060> finish<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.770> extinction

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
videos after you finish the extinction

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.830 
videos after you finish the extinction
game<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.010> think<00:02:18.190> that's<00:02:18.460> kind<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.700> cool<00:02:18.910> adds<00:02:19.240> a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
game I think that's kind of cool adds a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.960 
game I think that's kind of cool adds a
little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:20.110> more<00:02:20.530> interest<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
little bit more interest to the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.780 
little bit more interest to the
extinction<00:02:22.740> experience<00:02:23.740> I'm<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.640> glad

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
extinction experience I'm really glad

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.840 
extinction experience I'm really glad
that<00:02:24.910> they<00:02:25.150> did<00:02:25.480> add<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:26.260> Wonder<00:02:26.980> weapon<00:02:27.160> into

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
that they did add a Wonder weapon into

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.180 
that they did add a Wonder weapon into
extinction<00:02:28.330> now<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.870> probably<00:02:29.800> going<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> be

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
extinction now is probably going to be

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.520 
extinction now is probably going to be
on<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.150> map<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.660> I'm<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:32.110> really

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
on just this map but I'm really really

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.070 
on just this map but I'm really really
glad<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.070> add<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.430> some<00:02:33.670> unique<00:02:34.570> weapon

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
glad that I add in some unique weapon

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.660 
glad that I add in some unique weapon
into<00:02:35.440> extinction<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.130> makes<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.520> lot<00:02:36.610> more

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
into extinction it makes it a lot more

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.940 
into extinction it makes it a lot more
fun<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.540> Wonder<00:02:37.870> weapon<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.680> map<00:02:38.920> is

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
fun the Wonder weapon in this map is

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.090 
fun the Wonder weapon in this map is
called<00:02:39.460> iveta<00:02:39.850> max<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.480> really<00:02:41.440> really<00:02:41.800> fun

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
called iveta max it's really really fun

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.760 
called iveta max it's really really fun
to<00:02:42.250> use<00:02:42.490> yeah<00:02:43.090> BMO<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> bit<00:02:44.050> low<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.290> still

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to use yeah BMO is a bit low but still

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.210 
to use yeah BMO is a bit low but still
it<00:02:44.980> adds<00:02:45.280> something<00:02:46.590> unique<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
it adds something unique to the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790 
it adds something unique to the
extinction<00:02:48.580> experience<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:50.320> think<00:02:50.590> that

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
extinction experience and I think that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.160 
extinction experience and I think that
was<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.160> really<00:02:51.460> good<00:02:51.700> move<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:53.020> the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
was a really good move now for the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.200 
was a really good move now for the
things<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> don't<00:02:53.830> like<00:02:54.490> about<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.970> map

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
things that I don't like about this map

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.090 
things that I don't like about this map
and<00:02:55.480> I'm<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.840> straight<00:02:56.380> back<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
and I'm going straight back to the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.300 
and I'm going straight back to the
replay<00:02:57.880> value<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:59.080> replay<00:02:59.470> value<00:02:59.710> not<00:03:00.250> just

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
replay value the replay value not just

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.940 
replay value the replay value not just
for<00:03:00.760> nightfall<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:01.570> its<00:03:01.930> extinction<00:03:02.740> in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
for nightfall but its extinction in

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.880 
for nightfall but its extinction in
general<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.550> just<00:03:03.760> it's<00:03:04.390> just<00:03:04.510> not<00:03:04.960> there<00:03:05.380> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
general is just it's just not there it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.770 
general is just it's just not there it
literally<00:03:06.280> after<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.910> while<00:03:07.150> feel<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.720> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
literally after a while feel like a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.590 
literally after a while feel like a
campaign<00:03:08.410> extension<00:03:09.100> really<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.240> feels<00:03:10.420> like

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
campaign extension really it feels like

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.410 
campaign extension really it feels like
I'm<00:03:10.750> playing<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.340> extension<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.940> cod

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
I'm playing a extension of the cod

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.240 
I'm playing a extension of the cod
ghosts<00:03:13.990> campaign<00:03:14.320> doesn't<00:03:14.830> feel<00:03:15.130> like

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
ghosts campaign doesn't feel like

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.360 
ghosts campaign doesn't feel like
extinction<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.660> same<00:03:16.930> thing<00:03:17.350> over<00:03:17.590> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
extinction it's the same thing over and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.910 
extinction it's the same thing over and
over<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.209> over<00:03:19.420> again<00:03:19.720> yeah<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> difficulty

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
over and over again yeah the difficulty

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.890 
over and over again yeah the difficulty
adds<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.459> little<00:03:21.610> bit<00:03:21.730> more<00:03:22.000> replay<00:03:22.390> value<00:03:22.570> but

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
adds a little bit more replay value but

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.990 
adds a little bit more replay value but
it's<00:03:23.020> definitely<00:03:23.770> nowhere<00:03:24.459> near<00:03:24.640> like

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
it's definitely nowhere near like

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
it's definitely nowhere near like
zombies<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.790> kind<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.450> sucks<00:03:28.720> it

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
zombies is and it kind of sucks it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.960 
zombies is and it kind of sucks it
really<00:03:29.200> does<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.860> fun<00:03:30.160> for<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.489> week<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.910> then

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
really does it's fun for a week and then

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.790 
really does it's fun for a week and then
after<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.690> week<00:03:31.930> you're<00:03:32.110> like<00:03:32.200> ok<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.500> don't<00:03:32.650> want

isn't something crazy cool it has six
shots<00:04:19.750> at<00:04:20.109> once<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.530> can<00:04:20.680> carry<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:22.450> they

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
shots at once you can carry but they

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.300 
shots at once you can carry but they
didn't<00:04:22.810> really<00:04:22.900> add<00:04:23.140> much<00:04:23.169> stuff<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.220> was

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
didn't really add much stuff and I was

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.950 
didn't really add much stuff and I was
hoping

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
hoping

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.540 
hoping
imagine<00:04:25.410> if<00:04:25.500> they<00:04:25.620> added<00:04:25.919> in<00:04:26.009> some<00:04:26.039> new<00:04:26.340> ammo

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
imagine if they added in some new ammo

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.540 
imagine if they added in some new ammo
types<00:04:26.970> some<00:04:27.870> new<00:04:28.080> shields<00:04:28.830> some<00:04:29.100> new<00:04:29.280> things

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
types some new shields some new things

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.999 
types some new shields some new things
like<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.419> would<00:04:30.690> be<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.840> lot<00:04:31.710> better

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
like that that would be a lot better

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.680 
like that that would be a lot better
because<00:04:32.340> again<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.180> would<00:04:33.330> even<00:04:33.449> add

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
because again and that would even add

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.719 
because again and that would even add
more<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.380> replay<00:04:34.770> value<00:04:34.979> if<00:04:35.250> they<00:04:35.310> added<00:04:35.610> some

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
more to replay value if they added some

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.360 
more to replay value if they added some
new<00:04:35.759> shields<00:04:36.630> ammo<00:04:36.870> types<00:04:37.259> that<00:04:38.039> would<00:04:38.250> be

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
new shields ammo types that would be

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.820 
new shields ammo types that would be
something<00:04:38.610> really<00:04:39.210> really<00:04:39.479> great<00:04:39.900> but<00:04:40.560> it's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
something really really great but it's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.890

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
literally the same exact thing as point

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900 
literally the same exact thing as point
of<00:04:42.990> contact<00:04:43.500> using<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.160> same<00:04:44.400> abilities

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
of contact using the same abilities

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.360 
of contact using the same abilities
everything<00:04:45.389> else<00:04:45.569> they<00:04:46.319> added<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.680> new<00:04:46.979> class

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370
