00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
you see that your BA is in there this is

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.279 
you see that your BA is in there this is
a<00:05:01.030> dual<00:05:01.360> band<00:05:02.020> sandwich<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:02.590> out

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
a dual band sandwich this out

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.300 
a dual band sandwich this out
so<00:05:05.289> yeah<00:05:05.379> that's<00:05:05.560> because<00:05:05.680> them<00:05:06.039> they<00:05:06.159> look
