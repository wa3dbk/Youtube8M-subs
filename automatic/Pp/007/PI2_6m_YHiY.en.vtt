better the written with Bobby Roode

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.270 
better the written with Bobby Roode
before<00:01:13.020> talked<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.260> him<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:14.010> been<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
before talked about him I've been in the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.560 
before talked about him I've been in the
ring<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.460> Bobby<00:01:14.760> Roode<00:01:14.909> many<00:01:15.090> times<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
ring with Bobby Roode many times you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
ring with Bobby Roode many times you
know<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.020> tag<00:01:16.259> team<00:01:16.290> matches<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> singles

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
know in tag team matches and in singles

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.660 
know in tag team matches and in singles
matches<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.119> I've<00:01:18.500> think<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.549> as

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
matches and I've think that you know as

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
matches and I've think that you know as
far<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> listicle<00:01:22.380> II<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:23.280> mesh<00:01:23.460> up

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
far as you know I listicle II we mesh up

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.780 
far as you know I listicle II we mesh up
very<00:01:23.820> well<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> fans<00:01:24.600> benefit<00:01:25.080> but

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
very well I think the fans benefit but

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.039 
very well I think the fans benefit but

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
which I believe I will and then I get

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
which I believe I will and then I get
the<00:01:36.689> winner<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.930> AJ<00:01:37.290> Nerys<00:01:37.680> prediction<00:01:38.430> on

the winner of AJ Nerys prediction on

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.310 
the winner of AJ Nerys prediction on
that<00:01:39.950> that's<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.509> it's<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.720> close<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.140> call

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that that's that's it's so close to call

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520 
that that's that's it's so close to call
i<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.210> Ares<00:01:45.210> has<00:01:45.299> had<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> change<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
i think that Ares has had a change of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
i think that Ares has had a change of
attitude<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> late<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:47.670> seemingly

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
attitude as of late which seemingly

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
attitude as of late which seemingly
means<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.930> me<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> perhaps<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.920> some

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
means to me that perhaps you know some

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
means to me that perhaps you know some
of<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> craftiness<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.840> might<00:01:52.229> not

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
of that craftiness you know might not

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.679 
of that craftiness you know might not
make<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> surface<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> used<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> before

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
make the surface like it used to before

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.889 
make the surface like it used to before
and<00:01:55.020> i<00:01:55.079> think<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> overall<00:01:56.329> AJ's<00:01:57.329> experience

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and i think that overall AJ's experience

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.319 
and i think that overall AJ's experience
in<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.619> AJ's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> big-time<00:01:59.820> player<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
in you know AJ's a big-time player and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
in you know AJ's a big-time player and
you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.719> agent<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.140> Ares<00:02:01.560> has<00:02:01.649> been<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you know agent you know Ares has been to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670 
you know agent you know Ares has been to
the<00:02:02.040> top<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> mountain<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:02.969> AJ's<00:02:03.899> for

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the top of the mountain to but AJ's for

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.910 
the top of the mountain to but AJ's for
me<00:02:05.600> AJ<00:02:06.600> has<00:02:06.689> got<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> newfound<00:02:07.229> purpose<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
me AJ has got a newfound purpose and you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.210 
me AJ has got a newfound purpose and you
