through as opposed to give him a penalty
I<00:00:23.529> think<00:00:24.039> we<00:00:24.130> would<00:00:24.939> have<00:00:24.970> gone<00:00:25.119> away<00:00:25.210> with<00:00:25.480> it

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
I think we would have gone away with it

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
well against and beat Australia

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.320 
well against and beat Australia
fifteen<00:02:22.989> percent<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:27.060> well<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.239> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
fifteen percent I think well in the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.420 
fifteen percent I think well in the
first<00:02:28.480> half<00:02:28.630> when<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.739> got<00:02:29.890> into<00:02:30.040> Australia

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
first half when we we got into Australia

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.320 
first half when we we got into Australia
I<00:02:30.489> thought<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:30.790> were<00:02:30.849> playing<00:02:30.940> some<00:02:31.120> really

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
I thought we were playing some really

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
I thought we were playing some really
good<00:02:31.420> rugby<00:02:31.630> team<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:31.930> were<00:02:32.020> playing<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.440> really

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
good rugby team we were playing a really

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.120 
good rugby team we were playing a really
good<00:02:33.520> piece<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.940> temper<00:02:34.270> with<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.130> which

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
good piece and temper with it and which

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.120 
good piece and temper with it and which
was<00:02:36.280> creating<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.670> lot<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.849> gaps<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.209> us<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.130> we

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
was creating a lot of gaps for us and we

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.729 
was creating a lot of gaps for us and we
scored<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.700> try<00:02:39.959> royal<00:02:40.959> knocking<00:02:41.380> very<00:02:41.560> close

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
scored a try royal knocking very close

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.380 
scored a try royal knocking very close
to<00:02:41.860> scoring<00:02:42.010> off<00:02:42.220> set<00:02:42.430> piece<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.030> just

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
to scoring off set piece and just

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.229 
to scoring off set piece and just
rewiring<00:02:43.930> controller<00:02:44.319> game<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.239> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
rewiring controller game and the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.839 
rewiring controller game and the
frustration<00:02:46.480> would<00:02:47.080> come<00:02:47.489> probably<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.640> you

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
frustration would come probably the you

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
and play and it will just a little bit

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.520 
and play and it will just a little bit
hesitant<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:31.959> rock<00:03:32.200> as<00:03:32.350> opposed

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
hesitant going to that rock as opposed

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.009 
hesitant going to that rock as opposed
to<00:03:32.620> blasting<00:03:33.100> them<00:03:33.280> or<00:03:33.790> getting<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.660> offloads

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
to blasting them or getting the offloads

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.199 
to blasting them or getting the offloads
from<00:03:35.230> there<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.190> saw<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.579> with<00:03:36.819> Chris's

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
from there but you saw it with Chris's

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.009 
from there but you saw it with Chris's
break<00:03:37.450> great<00:03:38.200> support<00:03:38.620> simple<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:40.359> thought

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
break great support simple and I thought

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.780 
break great support simple and I thought
the<00:03:41.260> same<00:03:41.500> with<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.980> raw<00:03:42.190> really<00:03:42.549> made<00:03:42.700> that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
the same with the raw really made that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.819 
the same with the raw really made that
break<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.870> having<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.079> mentality<00:03:44.350> of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
break just having that mentality of

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.520 
break just having that mentality of
blast<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.549> we<00:03:45.579> school<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:47.319> just

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
blast and we school and it's just

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.949 
blast and we school and it's just
getting<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.769> urgency<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.549> bull<00:03:48.730> cow

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
getting that urgency to the bull cow

getting that urgency to the bull cow
we're<00:03:49.959> working<00:03:50.079> on<00:03:50.319> it<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.590> never<00:03:51.370> guys<00:03:51.639> will

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
thought they worked throughout the whole

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.680 
thought they worked throughout the whole
game<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.780> they're<00:04:17.350> fit<00:04:17.889> side<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.539> because<00:04:19.539> it

game and they're fit side and because it

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.020 
game and they're fit side and because it

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
was a stop-start at times because of the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.430 
was a stop-start at times because of the
areas<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.300> we<00:04:22.570> made<00:04:22.810> all<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.020> penalty<00:04:23.350> we

think<00:05:14.210> you<00:05:14.720> know<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.900> breakdow<00:05:15.260> can<00:05:15.470> look<00:05:15.590> at

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
think you know the breakdow can look at

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.910 
think you know the breakdow can look at
a<00:05:15.710> video<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:16.010> don't<00:05:16.280> recall<00:05:16.930> you<00:05:17.930> know<00:05:17.990> there's

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
a video I don't recall you know there's

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.380 
a video I don't recall you know there's
a<00:05:18.980> little<00:05:19.190> bit<00:05:19.310> stop-start<00:05:19.550> as<00:05:19.970> if<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.150> count

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
a little bit stop-start as if you count

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.910 
a little bit stop-start as if you count
anything<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> star<00:05:21.230> from<00:05:21.500> from<00:05:21.740> both

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
anything to the star from from both

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.240 
anything to the star from from both
teams<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.460> perhaps<00:05:23.150> we<00:05:23.510> you<00:05:24.020> sort<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.070> course

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
teams and perhaps we you sort of course

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.620 
teams and perhaps we you sort of course
I'd<00:05:25.400> rather<00:05:25.520> a<00:05:25.640> multiple<00:05:26.090> rhythm<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.390> little

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
I'd rather a multiple rhythm a little

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.380 
I'd rather a multiple rhythm a little
bit<00:05:26.750> but<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.380> know<00:05:27.500> it's<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:28.120> terms<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.240> the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
bit but you know it's a terms of the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.240 
bit but you know it's a terms of the
physicality<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.050> therefore<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.010> players

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
physicality and therefore the players

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.250 
physicality and therefore the players
there's<00:05:31.700> no<00:05:31.820> question<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.210> i<00:05:32.390> was<00:05:32.570> at

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
there's no question that i was at

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.230 
there's no question that i was at

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
present and you know I could feel it

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240 
present and you know I could feel it
behind<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.930> intensity<00:05:36.590> was<00:05:36.680> there<00:05:36.860> it's<00:05:37.040> just

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
behind the intensity was there it's just

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.070 
behind the intensity was there it's just
that<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:38.030> sec<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:38.300> having<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.840> drop<00:05:39.020> a

little<00:05:39.350> bit<00:05:39.560> and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
little bit and

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.210 
little bit and
