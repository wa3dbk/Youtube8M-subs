00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.139
 so try today so I 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.119
 present by gateway 8 me of which i will 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.279
 presents a hair makeup look and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 benefits so they will start with 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 apply my favorite chair which is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
 that of coca cola so I mix two 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.470
 hues to get to the color and who 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 I must have one that is a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 little bit too dark plus rock and a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 not too scared but that's really the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 perfect color then I apply and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.480
 of the concile hours so that's the one of 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.309
 maybelline that you really should 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 try if you have not tried yet 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.059
 I really do not really recommend it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.489
 to force it is my favorite of the moment 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.800
 so then I'm going to change the whole thing 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.789
 with a maybelline powder because 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.289
 the foundation was still 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.280
 really like glee and so then I 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.649
 will apply a little bit of happiness 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.890
 on the half side really plays just 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 to say I do not apply a lot 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 so then I think about the part 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 fun and so I think of makeup 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.170
 of gentlemen so I will use 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 the device nikon 1 2 hour of nyc and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.680
 so I do not have the steam color for 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.890
 all the eyelid mobile and then I 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.450
 I was boeck in the outer corner so 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 I will really mix everything up 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 with my brush for really that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.299
 make an ipod line the distinction 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 between the two colors of angers 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.040
 really a whole mix together the era 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.460
 just jordan the word in English in my 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.409
 head 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.430
 fade a little I do not know how to say 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 French having after to read a little 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.520
 pop in my eyes I have lunch at l 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.869
 honor and that's maybelline's 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.939
 so it 's really going to be because 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.189
 it's like a fire but I really 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.710
 not the incredible technique to put 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.049
 high liner so you will not see me 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000
 technique then I apply and from 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.920
 mascara this one is really my 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.990
 favorite is that of yves rock the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 sexy pulp and I bought some 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.219

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 love it and then I finished the look 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.259
 with my maybelline blush that's scared 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 like bloch eliminator so there 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.340
