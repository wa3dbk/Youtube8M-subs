00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.240
 A sea that brings us many blessings 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.750
 But in the sea 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 Neither sunlight nor radio waves reach 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.850
 The harsh world where the water pressure increases as you dive 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.920
 Second floor 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.870
 There is despite the fact that accounted for most of the sea 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.870
 Long was uncharted territory for humanity 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.260
 Good 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.140
 But in the deep sea 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.960
 There is a night life and resources 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.960
 The key to solve the mystery of the earth is M 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.810
 The challenge to the deep sea is also an adventure around the mystery of the earth 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.330
 Since its inception in 1971 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:18.910
 Jams Tech is wider and deeper 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.910
 Underneath we have developed a technology that approaches the deep sea 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.680
 A person dives into the sea and conducts a seafloor survey 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.670
 Sheet-peer furniture 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.970
 Work while exposed to high water pressure 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.909
 Established saturated diving technology 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.939
 And in order to conduct exploration in a wider range 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.780
 Pull the observation device by ship d 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.620
 Development of underwater acoustic system to investigate the seabed with sound waves 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.200
 Hmm 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:02:01.810
 Constructed a manned diving research vessel in the 1980s 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.810
 Researchers have made numerous discoveries by direct access to the deep sea 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.429
 Operation started in 1990 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.000
 Shinkai 6500 is 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.769
 Can dive up to 6500 meters deep 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.769
 It is a manned diving survey boat 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:31.450
 Development of unmanned spacecraft in full swing in the 1990s 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:34.230
 People can now access to dangerous places and 10,000 meters of large depth dont 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.230
 It is thought to be 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.610
 Furthermore in the 2000s 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.360
 Deep space exploration ship Chikyu large construction 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.920
 Beyond the deep sea 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.920
 The Earth is a ship that can drill the ocean floor and reach the mantle 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.360
 Currently equipped with a computer and inertial navigation system 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:06.680
 We are also working on the development of a self-contained unmanned spacecraft 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.680
 We aim to conduct further extensive and detailed exploration 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:21.420
 Ramstep puts world- class technology c 4 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:26.000
 We are conducting a wide range of research to solve the mystery of the entire Earth system from sea ​​urchins 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.000
 We introduce the main themes of them 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.819
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.819
 Global environmental changes such as global warming 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.010
 About 70% of the front of the earth 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:47.390
 Ocean that has a major impact on government agencies 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.810
 Cam step is not observed and automatic observation equipment and a ship changes in sea temperatures, such as observation buoy 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.870
 I will 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.750
 Super computer based on the data 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.750
 Use the Earth Simulator to predict fluctuations 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.980
 Climate change and exposure cycle 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.980
 We understand the interaction between the sea ​​and the atmosphere 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.160
 Many times have caused huge earthquakes 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:22.780
 Plate boundary near Japan 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:24.670
 Off the Pacific coast of Tohoku region in 2011 to elucidate the mechanism of earthquakes that occur beneath the seafloor 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.180
 The epicenter parents of the earthquake 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:32.340
 Immediately after that 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:38.300
 Sample by scientific drilling at the site of a huge earthquake 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.300
 It gave a measurement of frictional heat when the fault has moved 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:50.350
 As a result, we elucidated a new earthquake and tsunami generation mechanism called seismic live slip near Kakkoji ward 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.350
 Was 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:04.710
 Also whether the sensor network that was installed on the seabed 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.710
 We are developing an earthquake and tsunami observation and monitoring system that will be used for emergency earthquake bulletins . 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.210
 Earthquake and volcanic eruption 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:25.169
 Dynamic change reduction inside the earth causing spots of geomagnetic field etc. 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:32.099
 Jam stickers begin chemical analysis of rocks 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:41.810
 Solve this phenomenon with various approaches such as internal analysis and simulation 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:41.810
 We closing in on the mystery of the Earth evolution and the impact of the activities inside the earth has been given to the global environment 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:55.680
 The sea that has nurtured many lives 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:59.990
 It is estimated that there are about 33,000 yen species in the waters around Japan , and the rich diversity of the world 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.990
 It is clear to have 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:09.020
 And Japan is in the deep sea of ​​the world 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:15.220
 There is a hot water spouting area where the heat inside the earth spouts out 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.220
 It is believed to be the first place on earth where life was born 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:26.980
 In the jam stick Ya evolution of life by exploration study these unknown biosphere 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:34.120
 It is closing in on the mystery of species diversity 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:41.640
 It is also believed to play a key role in the carbon circulation system beneath the seafloor 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.640
 We are conducting research aimed at elucidating life activities in the deep underground 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.810
 in Japan 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:55.000
 There is a vast comprehensible exclusive economic zone 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:59.580
 Resources such as energy and rare metals 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.580
 It is believed to be abundant 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.440
 Jam spec has accumulated so far 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:14.020
 Utilizing deep-sea exploration know-how 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.020
 We are researching seabed resources 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.990
 Fronte and deep sea left for humanity 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:35.200
 Jamstep continues to challenge the deep sea for over 40 years 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:41.840
 To target the entire sea wait and Earth is now 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:48.320
 World-class period 8 has grown together with technical research 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:52.930
 And also jam step recommend the study of the entire Earth from the sun now 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.930
 We will contribute widely to society
