00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.060
 I do not belong to the Karimov axis 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.890
 political party a woman came on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.030
 beliefs that with the current Putin 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.300
 Russia and Kazakhstan can not run and 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.320
