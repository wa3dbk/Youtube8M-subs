the brief was a healthy seven symbolic
is<00:00:33.090> an<00:00:33.210> iconic<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.720> it<00:00:33.840> had<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.080> resonate<00:00:34.440> with

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is an iconic but it had to resonate with

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.450 
is an iconic but it had to resonate with
African<00:00:35.190> culture<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.330> you<00:00:37.010> know<00:00:38.010> making<00:00:38.250> a

African culture so you know making a
part<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.300> thought<00:00:39.480> well<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
part and I thought well this is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.060 
part and I thought well this is
something

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
something

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.940 
something
and<00:00:41.400> it's<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.300> object<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.900> all<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.410> from

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and it's an object that we all use from

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
and it's an object that we all use from
everyday<00:00:44.370> functional<00:00:45.060> stuff<00:00:45.330> too<00:00:45.750> it's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
everyday functional stuff too it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.550 
everyday functional stuff too it's
becoming<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.250> iconic<00:00:47.700> symbol<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.560> there's

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560

becoming in an iconic symbol and there's
a<00:00:49.650> lot<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> stories<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.700> lot<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.060> things<00:00:51.270> it's

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
a lot of stories a lot of things it's

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.330 
a lot of stories a lot of things it's
all<00:00:51.630> about<00:00:51.900> that<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.410> prices<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.040> parts

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
all about that some prices on the parts

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
all about that some prices on the parts
why<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.150> do<00:00:54.240> them<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
why we do them because it all and the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.110 
why we do them because it all and the
shape<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> parts<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> pattern<00:00:56.970> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
shape of the parts and the pattern it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
shape of the parts and the pattern it
all<00:00:57.390> makes<00:00:58.050> versions<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> part<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> Africa

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
all makes versions to a part of Africa

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
all makes versions to a part of Africa
because<00:00:59.970> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:01.200> use<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.380> lot<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.650> clay

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
because you know we use a lot of clay

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.950 
because you know we use a lot of clay
when<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.250> wake<00:01:02.370> up

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
when we wake up

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.539 
when we wake up
has<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.290> be<00:01:03.320> something<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:04.100> looks<00:01:04.309> like

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
has to be something that it looks like

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.359 
has to be something that it looks like
soil<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.720> our<00:01:05.840> colors<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> chromecast

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
soil in our colors to the chromecast

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.570 
soil in our colors to the chromecast
superset<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.380> we<00:01:09.470> use<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:10.130> chose

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
superset and so we use that and we chose

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.100 
superset and so we use that and we chose
colors<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:12.130> during<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.220> day<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:14.270> see<00:01:14.570> a

colors that during the day you see a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.290 
colors that during the day you see a
spectrum<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.159> colors<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.580> represent<00:01:16.790> the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
spectrum of colors that represent the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.240 
spectrum of colors that represent the

omen<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.170> we<00:01:36.320> added<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.950> made<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.130> claim<00:01:37.429> we

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
omen so we added we made a claim we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.169 
omen so we added we made a claim we
added<00:01:37.820> Berlin<00:01:38.179> where<00:01:38.950> people<00:01:39.950> from<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.060> world

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
added Berlin where people from the world

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.029

choose<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.660> final<00:01:41.840> ponytail<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:42.830> that's

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
choose the final ponytail so that's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.060 
choose the final ponytail so that's
essentially<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.520> idea<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.030> those<00:01:44.720> lies

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
essentially the idea and those lies

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.469 
essentially the idea and those lies
inside<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.280> state<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.759> represented<00:01:47.300> with

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
inside the state of the represented with

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.230 
inside the state of the represented with
green<00:01:47.690> eyes

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.300 

just<00:01:51.240> break<00:01:51.480> it<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.260> on<00:01:53.190> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
just break it up a little and on the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.300 
just break it up a little and on the
outside<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:54.120> taken<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:54.990> onto<00:01:55.470> paper<00:01:55.650> then

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
outside it's taken down onto paper then

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.510 
outside it's taken down onto paper then
we'll<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.030> actual<00:01:57.390> state<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> names<00:01:58.520> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
we'll have the actual state of names and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.400 
we'll have the actual state of names and
the<00:01:59.730> bowl<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.330> parts<00:02:00.660> it's<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.230> rain<00:02:01.380> of

the bowl the parts it's in a rain of
fire<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.190> that's<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.550> are<00:02:02.580> touched<00:02:02.910> although

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
fire and that's we are touched although

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.680 
fire and that's we are touched although
we<00:02:04.170> try<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.410> make<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.920> orange<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.570> the
