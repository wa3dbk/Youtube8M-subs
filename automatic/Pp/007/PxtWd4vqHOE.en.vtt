00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.900
 yes such an expensive enough device 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.560
 as am advising or night 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.880
 useful led 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.279
 literally it will cost 10 times 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.230
 cheaper what you can buy at the pet store 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:39.860
 or boiled shop for that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:44.150
 You need to have a light colored item 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.850
 lamps quartz tube it costs only 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.660
 only 300 rubles 350 that's the size 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.480
 and two lamps 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.879
 in clinics for disinfection 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.190
 premises in the operating room the so -called 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.250
 germicidal lamps 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.160
 they cost from 120 to 300 rubles the most 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.200
 the best 300 but you can buy for 120 they 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.100
 which places will be fine 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.740
 that's what needs to be done need to assemble this 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.740
 lambs set 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.810
 it is no more difficult than usual aquarium 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.070
 high gram put all collected 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.079
 I need all the rules 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.719
 look at affairs and unarmed 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.340
 the eye can not even look at them 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.289
 In no case can you check it completely 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.770
 perhaps literally called an hour 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:52.020
 let's see if it works or not 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.750
 disconnecting just hit they caught fire 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.299
 need some time to flare up 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.959
 we will not let them burn for us important 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:07.979
 so they work after this i lamp 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:11.819
 after checking I remove them again 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.620
 small covers because we are definitely you 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.209
 now make a device which 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.980
 is the following fixtures 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.040
 hardens inside 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.900
 peculiar is the construction that 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.450
 any person able to do and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.829
 the main tool will be the body and here are two 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.489
 screwdrivers which i will now all 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.780
 fights 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.780
 so I scheduled the place 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:43.220
 attaching a pencil have these 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:46.160
 most of our lamps but when possible features 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.800
 exactly known accuracy 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.800
 required and fix their screws 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.710
 Sep 2 is our element that will provide 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.990
 blow hamit bend 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.730
 ready i used all body here so 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.610
 called qbm 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 lamp used for medical 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.510
 purposes and it costs only 300 rubles is not 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.310
 zlatoslava independence about pilate he 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.209
 costs more 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.239
 here is our task device itself 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.650
 a look that's quartz lamp to make 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.370
 such special is not painted 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.500
 now show bent to in this 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.510
 case of 2 lamps I will erase fixtures for 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.709
 lamps from the tops enlighten all the water 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.860
 which will go through this 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:03.880
 quartz tube from the pump and filter and here 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:06.220
 and all well and then the details we will have 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.620
 cover I made another bracket of this 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.820
 three doses of points drilled here 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.560
 hole to be inserted 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17.890
 quartz tube finally quartz 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.040
 tube i'm a department so silicone 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.530
 tip so you can seal and 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:30.180
 you deserve here I insert these procedures 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.180
 primitively simple and easier already sky 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.000
 light will have to and must jump before 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.870
 drill with a drill bit and here is our 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.870
 checked the question 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:52.760
 and leave it awful 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.760
 prepared demo cut groups 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.970
 here it is the whole construction here 2 you 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.860
 top two lamps bottom 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.910
 crosshairs put the corpses through which 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.450
 water will actually pass 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.930
 which you sterilized left 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:19.140
 tighten the screws connect chili 3 what else 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:22.919
 ready principle i think everyone understands 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.830
 after ti4 lamp 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.419
 pipe that clings water 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.419
 any direction you can move 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.419
 left to attach the top cover 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.120
 and be sure that it is the most important thing 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.889
 make over shields live to in 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.820
 eyes in no way light missed 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.410
 under no circumstances put this 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.410
 from any material can be plastic 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.000
 can from 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.490
 example of galvanized iron for example 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.979
 make corners of the plate which 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.520
 fasten with screws and everything is natural 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:08.639
 collect all this in principle, I think everyone 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:12.850
 this service is so clear and simple 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:15.460
 now the lamps are 30 you on the 120 question he 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.900
 can provide water sterilization for now 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.389
 they up to 10 tons even in the sea well to him 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.860
 you can use his phrase water 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.750
 all sorts of large reservoirs in 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.789
 swimming pools for example base and not swimming pools 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.860
 tote asked me just good 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.960
 friend do you have your swimming pool 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.229
 He is green before each every three 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.539
 of the day 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:38.530
 which put the implementer that's all 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:42.220
 just compare this with the scenes in 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:45.310
 On the Internet, this sterilizer cost 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.960
 3000 rubles how much will it cost 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.960
 on 122 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.970
 I wish you success
