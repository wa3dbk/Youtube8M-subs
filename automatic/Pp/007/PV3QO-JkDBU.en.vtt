su parte question regarding education
one<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:04.140> I've<00:00:05.130> read<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:06.020> you<00:00:07.020> support<00:00:07.589> merit

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
one is I've read that you support merit

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.940 
one is I've read that you support merit
pay<00:00:08.099> for<00:00:08.130> teachers<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:09.030> I'm<00:00:09.269> wondering<00:00:09.950> how

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
pay for teachers and I'm wondering how

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.620 
pay for teachers and I'm wondering how
that<00:00:11.010> might<00:00:11.309> look<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.300> were<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> do<00:00:12.599> that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
that might look if you were to do that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.580 
that might look if you were to do that
and<00:00:13.130> also<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:14.610> would<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.910> fund<00:00:15.179> education

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
and also how would you fund education

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
and also how would you fund education
since<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.800> never<00:00:17.039> been<00:00:17.220> fully<00:00:17.580> funded<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
since it's never been fully funded I

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.540 
since it's never been fully funded I
actually<00:00:19.109> don't<00:00:19.529> support<00:00:19.949> merit<00:00:20.310> pay<00:00:20.520> for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
actually don't support merit pay for

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.570 
actually don't support merit pay for
teachers<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.810> commonly<00:00:21.990> understood

teachers as it's commonly understood
which<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.090> idea<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.500> you<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:26.420> uq

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
which is the idea that you know uq

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.230 
which is the idea that you know uq

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.759 
and I want to change the assessments of
how<00:02:05.200> teachers<00:02:05.950> are<00:02:06.310> evaluated<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.619> it's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
how teachers are evaluated so that it's

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.350 
how teachers are evaluated so that it's
not<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:08.979> based<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.700> standardized<00:02:10.269> test

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
not just based on a standardized test

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.330 
not just based on a standardized test
but<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:10.840> based<00:02:11.019> on<00:02:11.200> peer<00:02:11.500> review<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.069> it's

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
but it's based on peer review and it's

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.289 
but it's based on peer review and it's
based<00:02:12.549> on<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.819> whole<00:02:13.180> range<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.690> other<00:02:15.299> criteria

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
based on a whole range of other criteria

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.460 
based on a whole range of other criteria
now<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.310> have<00:02:18.610> said<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.940> if<00:02:19.390> having<00:02:20.260> done

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
now what I have said is if having done

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.740 
now what I have said is if having done
all<00:02:20.500> these<00:02:20.769> things<00:02:20.829> if<00:02:21.190> teachers<00:02:21.610> agree<00:02:22.360> and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
all these things if teachers agree and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.960 
all these things if teachers agree and
have<00:02:23.110> some<00:02:23.440> ownership<00:02:23.739> in<00:02:24.310> terms<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.819> how

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
have some ownership in terms of how

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.880 
have some ownership in terms of how
they're<00:02:25.209> being<00:02:25.390> assessed<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.049> they<00:02:26.560> want<00:02:26.769> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
they're being assessed and they want to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.309 
they're being assessed and they want to
reward<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:28.120> negotiations<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:28.989> school

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
reward in negotiations with the school

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.520 
reward in negotiations with the school
board<00:02:29.349> teachers<00:02:30.250> who<00:02:30.400> are<00:02:30.430> doing<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.760> great<00:02:30.940> job

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
board teachers who are doing a great job

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.869 
board teachers who are doing a great job
that's<00:02:32.530> fine<00:02:32.799> but<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.069> won't<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.670> without

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
that's fine but I won't do it without

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.330 
that's fine but I won't do it without
the<00:02:34.239> approval<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.470> teachers<00:02:35.799> because

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the approval of the teachers because

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.550 
the approval of the teachers because
teachers<00:02:36.629> if<00:02:37.629> they<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:38.019> they're<00:02:38.140> not<00:02:38.319> bought

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
teachers if they if they're not bought

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.950 
teachers if they if they're not bought
in<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:41.379> not<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.799> work
