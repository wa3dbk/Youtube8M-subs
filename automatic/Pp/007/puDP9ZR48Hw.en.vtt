I<00:01:02.159> saw<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> glow<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> bottom

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I saw a glow and there was the bottom

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
I saw a glow and there was the bottom
and<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.450> trimmed<00:01:06.899> out<00:01:07.050> neutral

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and I just I just trimmed out neutral

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.840 
and I just I just trimmed out neutral
just<00:01:08.190> hovered<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.479> floated<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
just hovered and just floated down and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
just hovered and just floated down and
made<00:01:11.850> slow<00:01:12.240> contact<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> bottom<00:01:13.259> didn't

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
made slow contact at the bottom didn't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.820 
made slow contact at the bottom didn't
even<00:01:13.680> make<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> cloud<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> silt<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.649> sat

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
even make like a cloud of silt just sat

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
even make like a cloud of silt just sat
there<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.100> thought<00:01:17.810> Here<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> am

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.260

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
paint on a on a sheet of Mason a kind of

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.520 
paint on a on a sheet of Mason a kind of
snow<00:01:30.189> snow<00:01:30.789> fields<00:01:31.329> almost<00:01:32.079> is<00:01:32.259> what<00:01:32.439> it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
snow snow fields almost is what it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.569 
snow snow fields almost is what it
looked<00:01:32.710> like<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.100> was<00:01:33.189> really<00:01:33.250> quite

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
looked like it was really quite

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.370 
looked like it was really quite
beautiful<00:01:33.759> but<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> meantime<00:01:34.990> I'm

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
beautiful but in the meantime I'm

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.139 
beautiful but in the meantime I'm
looking<00:01:35.740> for<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.220> know<00:01:36.310> any<00:01:36.520> animals<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.090> I

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
looking for you know any animals that I

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.039 
looking for you know any animals that I
see<00:01:37.450> which<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:37.960> didn't<00:01:38.200> see<00:01:38.380> any<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.840> what

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
see which I didn't see any then what

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.870 
see which I didn't see any then what
happened<00:01:41.350> was<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.770> hydraulics<00:01:42.429> failed<00:01:42.640> and

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
happened was the hydraulics failed and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.120 
happened was the hydraulics failed and
the<00:01:43.630> hydraulic<00:01:44.110> fuel<00:01:44.200> just<00:01:44.530> kind<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.799> bubbled

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
the hydraulic fuel just kind of bubbled

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.889 
the hydraulic fuel just kind of bubbled
up<00:01:45.220> in<00:01:45.399> front<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.789> window<00:01:46.270> from<00:01:46.509> up<00:01:46.659> from

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
up in front of the window from up from

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.870 
up in front of the window from up from
it<00:01:47.200> was<00:01:47.350> actually<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.679> burst<00:01:48.009> hose<00:01:48.250> fitting<00:01:48.700> on

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
it was actually a burst hose fitting on

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.789 
it was actually a burst hose fitting on
the<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.289> arm<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:52.420> another<00:01:53.200> critical

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
the on the arm then another critical

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.720 
the on the arm then another critical
system<00:01:54.190> failure

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.420 

I<00:01:56.790> started<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> lose<00:01:57.750> thrusters<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:59.190> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
I started to lose thrusters at that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.820 
I started to lose thrusters at that
moment<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.060> could<00:02:00.300> only<00:02:00.600> turn<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.080> couldn't<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
moment I could only turn I couldn't I

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.140 
moment I could only turn I couldn't I
couldn't<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.250> forward<00:02:02.550> anymore

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
couldn't go forward anymore

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.500 
couldn't go forward anymore
and<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> was<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.760> I'd<00:02:06.000> lost<00:02:06.360> my

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
and so that was it you know I'd lost my

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.109 
and so that was it you know I'd lost my
hydraulics<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.410> now<00:02:07.770> had<00:02:08.130> no<00:02:08.490> ability<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.000> move

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
hydraulics I now had no ability to move

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.210 
hydraulics I now had no ability to move
forward<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.960> thought<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.650> everything<00:02:10.860> I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
forward I thought about everything I

wait

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.949 

some<00:02:36.349> took<00:02:36.499> off<00:02:36.709> from<00:02:37.310> seven<00:02:37.700> miles<00:02:37.879> down<00:02:37.999> back

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
some took off from seven miles down back

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.979 
some took off from seven miles down back
to<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.139> surface<00:02:39.409> was<00:02:40.310> 70<00:02:40.969> minutes<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.749> sub

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
to the surface was 70 minutes the sub

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.619 
to the surface was 70 minutes the sub
was<00:02:42.139> a<00:02:42.349> rocket<00:02:42.920> at<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.280> point<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.299> felt

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
was a rocket at that point and it felt

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.709 
was a rocket at that point and it felt
like<00:02:44.749> a<00:02:44.870> train<00:02:45.200> car<00:02:45.469> going<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.480> that's<00:02:47.659> the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:47.719 
like a train car going so that's the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
fastest I'd have removed
