months<00:00:07.710> ago<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.189> created<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.639> video<00:00:08.760> showing<00:00:09.179> you

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
months ago I created a video showing you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.330 
months ago I created a video showing you
how<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.690> organized<00:00:10.110> by<00:00:10.320> round<00:00:10.559> 2<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:11.309> I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
how to get organized by round 2 but I

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.339 
how to get organized by round 2 but I
was<00:00:11.670> able<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> refine<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.450> strategy<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
was able to refine that strategy and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.990 
was able to refine that strategy and
knock<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.740> down<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.889> round<00:00:14.190> 1<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.759> thought<00:00:14.969> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
knock it down to round 1 so I thought I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.640 
knock it down to round 1 so I thought I
would<00:00:15.210> show<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.360> guys<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.440> you're<00:00:16.560> gonna

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
want to do is when you spawn and open

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
want to do is when you spawn and open
the<00:00:18.690> door<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> double<00:00:19.619> points<00:00:19.890> once<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the door to the double points once that

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.010 
the door to the double points once that
door<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> double<00:00:21.150> points<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.480> open<00:00:21.840> what

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
door to the double points is open what

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
door to the double points is open what
you're<00:00:22.140> gonna<00:00:22.230> want<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.100> wait<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you're gonna want to do is wait for the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
you're gonna want to do is wait for the
zombies<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.449> spawn<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.260> you'll<00:00:25.439> notice<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
zombies to spawn in now you'll notice I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
zombies to spawn in now you'll notice I
didn't<00:00:26.490> wait<00:00:26.670> till<00:00:26.849> they're<00:00:26.970> into<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> map

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
didn't wait till they're into the map

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.939 
didn't wait till they're into the map
normally<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.230> let<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.500> into<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> map

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
normally I would let them into the map

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
normally I would let them into the map
but<00:00:29.070> unfortunately<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.670> accidentally<00:00:30.330> grabbed

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
but unfortunately I accidentally grabbed

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
but unfortunately I accidentally grabbed
the<00:00:30.630> double<00:00:30.869> points<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:32.130> doesn't

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the double points but what doesn't

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.590 
the double points but what doesn't
matter<00:00:32.550> once<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> double<00:00:33.329> points

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
matter once you get the double points

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.850 
matter once you get the double points
just<00:00:33.750> make<00:00:33.870> sure<00:00:34.050> you're<00:00:34.170> maximizing<00:00:34.320> your

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
just make sure you're maximizing your

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.290 
just make sure you're maximizing your
points<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.430> gonna<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.730> aiming<00:00:35.940> for

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
points and you're gonna be aiming for

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
points and you're gonna be aiming for
about<00:00:36.450> 2,000<00:00:37.170> points<00:00:37.440> once<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.280> about

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
about 2,000 points once you get about

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
about 2,000 points once you get about
2,000<00:00:39.000> points<00:00:39.270> you're<00:00:39.510> good<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.170> you're

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.440 
one zombie alive and that one zombie you
leave<00:00:43.230> alive<00:00:43.500> cannot<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.430> any<00:00:44.730> damage<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.390> he

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
far away so as you'll see I spent about

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
far away so as you'll see I spent about
a<00:00:53.820> thousand<00:00:54.270> points<00:00:54.420> opening<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.020> way<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.350> into

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
a thousand points opening my way up into

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
a thousand points opening my way up into
this<00:00:55.710> part<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> cell<00:00:56.340> block<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this part of the cell block and then I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
this part of the cell block and then I
use<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> other<00:00:57.870> bit<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.230> points<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> open

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
use the other bit of my points to open

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.260 
use the other bit of my points to open
up<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> other<00:00:59.219> side<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> cell<00:00:59.789> block<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
up the other side of the cell block and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
up the other side of the cell block and
once<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.690> those<00:01:00.840> doors<00:01:01.079> open<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.829> gonna

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
once I have those doors open I'm gonna

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
once I have those doors open I'm gonna
kill<00:01:02.280> myself<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.969> power<00:01:03.210> switch<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.629> I'm

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
kill myself on that power switch and I'm

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
kill myself on that power switch and I'm
gonna<00:01:03.870> run<00:01:04.140> all<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.559> over<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.220> now

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
gonna run all the way over here now

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.580 
gonna run all the way over here now
there<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> shortcut<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.990> power<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.530> power

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
there is a shortcut to power this power

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.170 
there is a shortcut to power this power
some<00:01:07.979> generators<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.090> not

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
some generators right here but I'm not

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.490 
some generators right here but I'm not
very<00:01:09.240> good<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.170> went<00:01:10.470> through

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
very good at it so I just went through

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
very good at it so I just went through
all<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> parkour<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.700> once<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.000> power<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
all the parkour but once I power that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390

is on the other side of the map what you
can<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.630> power<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.200> generator<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
can do is power the generator on the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.140 
can do is power the generator on the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.030 
other side of the map like you normally
would<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> did

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
would but because it was there I did

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130 
would but because it was there I did
have<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.369> run<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.360> once<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> key

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have to run over now once I have the key

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
have to run over now once I have the key
down<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.280> part<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> part<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> the

showers<00:01:30.780> open<00:01:31.140> I'm<00:01:31.229> gonna<00:01:31.380> run<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> way

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
showers open I'm gonna run all the way

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
showers open I'm gonna run all the way
over<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> key<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> record

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
over to the key and just for the record

over to the key and just for the record
this<00:01:33.689> gameplay<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.320> sped<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
this gameplay is sped up so that you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.499 
this gameplay is sped up so that you
don't<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> sit<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.299> ten

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
don't have to sit there about ten

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
don't have to sit there about ten
minutes<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> gameplay<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.130> does

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
minutes of gameplay because this does

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.620 
minutes of gameplay because this does
take<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.850> bit<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.360> there

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
take a little bit of time because there

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
take a little bit of time because there
is<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.930> setting<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:41.009> once<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.310> had<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
is some setting up now once I had the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
is some setting up now once I had the
key<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.090> gonna<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.570> run<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> way

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
key what I'm gonna do is run all the way

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
key what I'm gonna do is run all the way
over<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> showers<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.460> gonna<00:01:44.579> open

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
up the door to the showers what we're

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.139 
up the door to the showers what we're
doing<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.130> taking<00:01:47.280> advantage<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> fact

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
doing is taking advantage of the fact

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.300 
doing is taking advantage of the fact
that<00:01:48.299> about<00:01:48.450> 24<00:01:48.960> zombies<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.649> spawn<00:01:50.009> when

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that about 24 zombies will spawn when

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.490 
that about 24 zombies will spawn when
you<00:01:50.460> activate<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> washing<00:01:51.450> machine<00:01:51.780> keep<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you activate the washing machine keep in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.020 
you activate the washing machine keep in
mind<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.340> real<00:01:53.460> T<00:01:53.610> player<00:01:53.790> there's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
mind if you are in real T player there's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700 
mind if you are in real T player there's
a<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.299> chance<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> Brutus<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.200> spawn<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
a good chance that Brutus will spawn and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
a good chance that Brutus will spawn and
you<00:01:55.770> won't<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.040> any<00:01:56.100> zombies<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.880> spawn<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you won't get any zombies to spawn so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
gonna kill myself on that generator

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
gonna kill myself on that generator
right<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:01.799> gonna<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.159> into<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
gonna power this double points you can

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.020 
gonna power this double points you can
power<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.100> double<00:02:26.340> points<00:02:26.550> whenever<00:02:26.790> just

difficult as I worked my way to the
double<00:02:53.940> points<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.020> trying<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
double points because what I'm trying to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.540 
double points because what I'm trying to
do<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.950> double<00:02:56.190> points<00:02:56.400> before

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
do is get to that double points before

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.730 
do is get to that double points before
kill<00:02:56.970> any<00:02:57.210> zombies<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.990> maximize<00:02:58.140> my

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
points so you'll notice that you hung

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.390 
points so you'll notice that you hung
out<00:03:00.660> over<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:01.620> bit<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.100> then

earlier we're really just trying to
maximize<00:03:19.560> our<00:03:19.590> points<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.130> we're<00:03:20.310> aiming<00:03:20.520> for

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
maximize our points and we're aiming for

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.490 
maximize our points and we're aiming for
about<00:03:20.970> six<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.480> five<00:03:21.750> thousand<00:03:22.200> points

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
about six to five thousand points

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
about six to five thousand points
because<00:03:23.040> what<00:03:23.190> we're<00:03:23.310> gonna<00:03:23.400> need<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.670> do<00:03:23.790> is

because what we're gonna need to do is
open<00:03:24.120> up<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.390> door<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.050> reach<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.440> top

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
open up a door so we can reach the top

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.320 
open up a door so we can reach the top
level<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.100> cellblock<00:03:26.550> we're<00:03:27.030> gonna<00:03:27.120> need<00:03:27.240> to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
level the cellblock we're gonna need to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.730 
level the cellblock we're gonna need to
power<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> gondola<00:03:28.110> then<00:03:28.260> we're<00:03:28.380> gonna<00:03:28.470> mean

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
power the gondola then we're gonna mean

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.260 
power the gondola then we're gonna mean
you<00:03:28.890> need<00:03:29.130> about<00:03:29.250> two<00:03:29.520> thousand<00:03:29.940> five<00:03:30.120> hundred

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
you need about two thousand five hundred

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.210 
you need about two thousand five hundred
dollars<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.720> get<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.290> actually<00:03:32.040> purchase

Juggernog so as you're seeing going to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280 
Juggernog so as you're seeing going to
town<00:03:34.709> with<00:03:34.770> my<00:03:35.250> pistol<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.180> might<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.230> a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
Maxima to do this I'm not quite sure I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.970 
Maxima to do this I'm not quite sure I
haven't<00:03:39.330> actually<00:03:39.570> fully<00:03:40.020> taken<00:03:40.530> advantage

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
haven't actually fully taken advantage

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.770 
haven't actually fully taken advantage
of<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.430> double<00:03:41.700> points<00:03:41.940> by<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.510> think

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
of the double points by just and I think

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.570 
of the double points by just and I think
I<00:03:42.930> seem<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.500> normally<00:03:43.920> get<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.070> maximum<00:03:44.370> or

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
I seem to normally get a maximum or

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.770 
I seem to normally get a maximum or
whatever<00:03:44.850> I'm<00:03:45.030> doing<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:45.420> although<00:03:45.630> you

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
whatever I'm doing this although you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.170 
whatever I'm doing this although you
won't<00:03:46.080> always<00:03:46.350> get<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> max<00:03:46.830> ammo<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:48.000> you'll

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
won't always get a max ammo so as you'll

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.030 
won't always get a max ammo so as you'll
see<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.360> did<00:03:48.780> run<00:03:48.930> out<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.320> double<00:03:49.620> points<00:03:49.860> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
see I did run out of a double points and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.560 
see I did run out of a double points and
there<00:03:50.190> are<00:03:50.340> multiple<00:03:50.640> double<00:03:50.970> points<00:03:51.300> on<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
there are multiple double points on the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.180 
there are multiple double points on the
map<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:51.989> can<00:03:52.290> use<00:03:52.530> your<00:03:52.680> time<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
map and you can use your time in the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.040 
map and you can use your time in the
afterlife<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.730> power<00:03:53.910> them<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.360> just<00:03:54.690> did<00:03:54.900> in

to<00:04:07.500> power<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.830> gondola<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.730> because<00:04:09.090> we<00:04:09.270> did
