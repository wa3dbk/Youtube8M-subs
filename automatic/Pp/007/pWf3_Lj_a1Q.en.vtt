00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 and his bras well kind what at 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:24.689
 part of the juice maybe part I you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 immediately shows agreement for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.700
 start we're going to make a natural candle 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.610
 with a super orange okay so I 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.230
 Can not you seem so little good 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 I trust the meetings you take 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 a knife 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.390
 yes you do not hurt you do you make a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 knife and you're going to cut and on orange in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.719
 two but only the skin so tulle 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.329
 in size like what's all around 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.300
 and there I already cut 3 fingers to a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.340
 okay then everything takes a big 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.829
 spoon and year is to succeed in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 angers the skin without breaking it 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.649
 it's not very complicated with the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.869
 spoon good after you eat it in one 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:11.670
 tidying up you do not play it but you do it 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.260
 finally it happens that it will be worth to me 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 already a candle and suddenly we are 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.420
 even Jewish then we have not yet 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.939
 completed 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.100
 ideally we made a little dried 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.570
 his orange peel okay that's it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 wet is that it is with the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.939
 meditate know a little more trouble with that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 is but it's so it should 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.409
 walk anyway like those whose 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.049
 suspense you take in 2002 book that goes 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.920
 serve as fuel you fill your 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.280
 small orange 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 ok su puts oil on the job but 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.729
 still so that they ignite well 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.670
 okay and then you go to the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.020
 bookstore 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.520

 green face or Sylvain but it smells IP 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 do not go up so it's a bit low 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.640
 Obviously suddenly the orange oil 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.110
 exactly olive and it makes a little 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.180
 candle a little green and if it's 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.200
