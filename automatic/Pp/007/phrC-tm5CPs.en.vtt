 hello everybody and welcome to the follow up 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 Basic concepts in after 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.670
 effects that gustavo teacher speaks 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.770
 for the blog to escape or to the point with 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.390
 before starting this class I would like 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.210
 to report that it is on sale in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.430
 our blog a dvd with 70 video lessons in 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 premiere pro after effects shrink 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.550
 photoshop 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.529
 who has interested just access the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 link from the store below. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.890
 in the comments 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 returning to the theme of today in class 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 previous we talked about these 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 transformation parameters and today 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.000
 we'll cover what animation frames and keys 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 shortcut 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 let's start by creating animation 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.289
 quite simple which is additional 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 This video has been made by althea 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.590
 I'm going to work initially with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 parameter the patient then with the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.879
 indicator at the beginning I'm going to click 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.660
 button for that frame in general. 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.070
 point and I will zero the opacity value 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.769
 now I'll take the time indicator until 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.850
 a second and I will bring the opacity to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.070
 100 percent 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.950
 you have automatically generated a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.740
 new that frame and this way we have the fade 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.100
 in created now i 'll carry the indicator 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.200
 up to 4 seconds and will generate one that fights 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 at this point this time by clicking on this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.409
 button 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 this causes the frame to assume the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.810
 already exist for the capacity 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.909
 in this case 100% and now with the indicator 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.729
 time in five seconds I will reset the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.490
 value of opacity and so we have the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.770
 fade out 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 see that using only that frei miss was 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.110
 create this effect 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.610
 if you want it is lethal that low frame 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 you select the same 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.780
 see that selecting and staying in color 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.070
 and then you press 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 delete key 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.170
 you can select one or more frames 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.020
 at the same time I'm going to delete that other one 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.799
 also an interesting feature that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.610
 we can use here is the copy and paste that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.009
 frames 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 see the example I will select these two 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.729
 what frames 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.979
 I will use the control c to copy will 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.890
 take the time indicator up to 4 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.350
 seconds and I'll use the v control to 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.840
 Hello, we have a copy here. 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.420
 of the initial frames 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.290
 note that these two from the beginning are 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.410
 generating a fade and those two of the end 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.050
 as are a copy of the initials they 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.820
 also generate was of us we can 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.560
 turning it here was Dalton and 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.450
 a rather simple way in the after 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.370
 effects with two frames 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.010
 selected will click the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.650
 right on one of them I go in the option that 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.230
 I attended and I will select the team 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.480
 universe that frames and now we have a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.480
 fade out he reversed his values 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.440
 ok then we used here to generate that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.019
 frames for grazing we can make the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.450
 same way with the other parameters 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.310
 let's play with the scale a bit 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.430
 take the time indicator to a 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.230
 second flight was that frame at that point 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 for the scale 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.010
 now I'll take the indicator up to two 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.870
 seconds and I will bring scale to 50% 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.220
 we will then take the indicator up to 3 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.500
 seconds and return the value 100 percent 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.049
 note that we now have animation for the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.780
 opacity and scale 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.709
 in the beginning we have the fade from a 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.329
 as it begins to decrease the scale 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.940
 arrive here in at least two seconds 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.900
 begins to return up to 100% in three 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.890
 seconds 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.610
 and there we have this animation we can also 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.170
 here play around with the rotation 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.420
 let's generate a frame at this point 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.120
 here in the second goal taking the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.060
 time indicator up to two seconds and 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 I'm going to put a 180 degree turn here 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.980
 This will reverse our view of the video. 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.260
 leave it upside down and now 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.090
 we have three animations one for the scale 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.079
 rotation and opacity 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.079
 see example 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.730
 an interesting resource that we count on 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.549
 here for the rotation is the following you 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.979
 can determine how many complete laps 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.840
 it will give in a certain space of 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.359
 I 'm going to delete that second 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.490
 Spin the frame okay and I will do 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.630
 following here for a second we already generated the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.840
 what frame 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.449
 I'll take up to three seconds. 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.169
 and I will say the following that is that in three 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.090
 seconds 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.580
 He's going to take a full turn then. 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.110
 you put the value here then we have a 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.050
 turn 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.870
 so we have it here 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.949
 he begins to act to and at that point he 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.949
 arrives at a complete turn 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.410
 we can then put another value 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.169
 Let's put here two full laps 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.010
 now in the same space from 1 to 3 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.960
 seconds 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.949
 He's going to give you two fingers, so see a 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.180
 twirl 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:05.030
 two turns ok then and if anyway 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.139
 you can use it for others 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.450
 position parameters and a talking bodice 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.940
 a little bit about shortcut keys 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.340
 we have some interesting keys that 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.270
 useful for us to use in 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.110
 our elections are following the 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.760
 pressing the key opens you 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.250
 transformation parameter am body 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.180
 yesterday the p key 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:36.770
 I opened the position parameter the s key 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:40.220
 only open the skill parameter the r key 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.520
 April the ro Teichmann parameter and the key 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.740
 the patient opens the parameter 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.780
 these keys are useful sometimes you 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.190
 want to work only with the 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.729
 processing of these 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.580
 so you use these shortcuts we have another 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.590
 useful and useful shortcut that 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.289
 It's the key. See what happens, I'm going. 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.690
 press the key then it will open 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.750
 all parameters that have to 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.120
 frames 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.840
 which frames to scale rotation and 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.660
 pasture 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.539
 by pressing the key or it opened e x3 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.510
 is parameter if they are quite useful 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.700
 also an interesting technique of 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.520
 shortcut we have here is the following you 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:26.210
 you can navigate between those frames 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.780
 using the following shortcut keys here 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.030
 makes you advance between those frames 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.060
 and the j key 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:40.240
 makes you go back among the fronts 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:43.150
 here are advancing and returns j 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.330
 Okay, so we have a shortcut. 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.150
 very useful here too that is the option 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.380
 of you cropping a video a photo or 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.330
 any other media 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.090
 I'll bring a photo here for our 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.970
 makeup I'll put her above let 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.500
 she decides this position and I see that we 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.140
 I do I'll leave here one 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.490
 indicator of time in the second and I go 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:10.160
 use is the following shortcut out opens 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.790
 brackets see that we made a cut 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.660
 tatto out ab brackets it makes a cut 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.900
 initial 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.810
 so we have now in this space here in the 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.230
 start tells only the video from a 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.090
 The second one comes in the photo, okay? I'll put it. 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.760
 here in three seconds to make a 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.860
 final cut you use the high and close 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.700
 purses perhaps he cut this 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.090
 Score 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.860
 and here we only came back 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.890
 So are these techniques enough? 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.320
 useful and are the ones we use most 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.480
 as a shortcut in after effects 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.740
 Good staff with this we finished the 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.350
 Today's lesson 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.780
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.520
 liked please click liked 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.230
 if possible add this video to the
