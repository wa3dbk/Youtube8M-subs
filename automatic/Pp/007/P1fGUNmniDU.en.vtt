artificial hair or hair to add in that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689 
artificial hair or hair to add in that
blends<00:00:54.960> easily<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.949> their<00:00:56.129> natural<00:00:56.309> hair

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.000 
blends easily with their natural hair
texture<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.050> finger<00:00:58.320> comb<00:00:58.530> gives<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
texture and the finger comb gives you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.060 
texture and the finger comb gives you
that<00:00:59.250> option<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.180> um<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.629> kinky<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that option it's um very kinky but it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
that option it's um very kinky but it
still<00:01:02.280> has<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.460> curl<00:01:02.789> definition<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.510> there

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
still has some curl definition in there

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.679 
still has some curl definition in there
if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.820> also<00:01:06.000> allows<00:01:06.540> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
if you can see that it also allows you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.000 
if you can see that it also allows you
to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> styles<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to do some of the styles that we do in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
to do some of the styles that we do in
natural<00:01:08.340> hair<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.670> two<00:01:08.880> strand<00:01:09.150> twists<00:01:09.600> do

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
natural hair like two strand twists do

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
natural hair like two strand twists do
some<00:01:10.439> sets<00:01:10.740> coils<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.729> things<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.360> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
some sets coils and things like that so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.499 
some sets coils and things like that so
it's<00:01:13.470> easier<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.490> blend<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.030> natural

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
what we think but so far I mean it comes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.560 
what we think but so far I mean it comes
nice<00:01:25.590> packaging<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.490> lift<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> weston

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
nice packaging and lift it with a weston

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.800 
nice packaging and lift it with a weston
one<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.170> an<00:01:28.290> amber<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.610> matched<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.360> pear

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
one it's an amber it matched my pear

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.200 
one it's an amber it matched my pear
color<00:01:31.170> pretty<00:01:31.439> much<00:01:31.680> my<00:01:31.890> roots<00:01:32.159> were<00:01:32.310> dark<00:01:32.970> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
color pretty much my roots were dark so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
color pretty much my roots were dark so
we<00:01:33.329> needed<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> lighten<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.680> otherwise

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we needed to lighten that but otherwise

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
we needed to lighten that but otherwise
it<00:01:35.640> worked<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.329> well<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it worked out really well for me so I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.359 
it worked out really well for me so I
wanted<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.439> show<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.040> tried<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
