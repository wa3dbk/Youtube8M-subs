both<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.989> these<00:03:30.109> came<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:31.510> dust<00:03:32.510> bags<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.579> they

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
both of these came in dust bags so they

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.539 
both of these came in dust bags so they
were<00:03:34.819> in<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.269> dust<00:03:35.510> bag<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.560> i<00:03:37.040> guess<00:03:37.340> when

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
were in the dust bag so i guess when

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.979 
were in the dust bag so i guess when
they<00:03:37.639> came<00:03:37.790> off<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.150> line<00:03:38.180> there's<00:03:38.630> two<00:03:38.780> dust

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
bags they're both the same i guess when

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.509 
bags they're both the same i guess when
they<00:03:41.750> came<00:03:41.900> off<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.200> line<00:03:42.230> they<00:03:42.829> got<00:03:43.010> stained

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
they came off the line they got stained

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.039 
they came off the line they got stained
before<00:03:44.030> they<00:03:44.150> got<00:03:44.269> put<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.630> dust<00:03:44.870> bag

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
before they got put in the dust bag

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.699 
before they got put in the dust bag
because<00:03:45.349> I<00:03:46.900> mean<00:03:47.900> they<00:03:48.019> wish<00:03:48.169> that's<00:03:48.440> how<00:03:48.590> they

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
because I mean they wish that's how they

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.740 
because I mean they wish that's how they
were<00:03:48.769> shipped<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:50.000> that's<00:03:50.239> how<00:03:50.389> it<00:03:50.480> came<00:03:50.510> out

on<00:04:12.349> this<00:04:12.730> shoe<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:14.000> do<00:04:14.599> like<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.930> carbon<00:04:15.230> fiber

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
on this shoe I do like the carbon fiber

on this shoe I do like the carbon fiber
with<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.889> jumpman<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.699> think<00:04:16.850> that's

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
with the jumpman on it I think that's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.080 
with the jumpman on it I think that's
really<00:04:17.209> dope

really dope

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.539
