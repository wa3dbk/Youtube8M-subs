00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.840 
step1 washed and dried greens a very key
step<00:00:32.110> is<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.680> make<00:00:32.860> sure<00:00:32.890> that<00:00:33.070> they're<00:00:33.340> dry<00:00:33.579> I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
step is to make sure that they're dry I

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.760 
step is to make sure that they're dry I
use<00:00:33.910> spinach<00:00:34.480> greens<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.230> only<00:00:35.440> greens<00:00:35.649> I

use spinach greens the only greens I

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.170 
use spinach greens the only greens I
don't<00:00:35.949> really<00:00:36.250> recommend<00:00:36.520> using<00:00:36.790> it<00:00:37.059> as

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
don't really recommend using it as

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.670 
don't really recommend using it as
anything<00:00:37.449> that<00:00:37.629> has<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:37.960> little<00:00:38.170> bit<00:00:38.320> more<00:00:38.559> of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
anything that has a little bit more of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.950 
anything that has a little bit more of
water<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.309> like<00:00:39.790> iceberg<00:00:40.420> or<00:00:40.660> romaine

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960

step2 finely mince fresh garlic canned

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
step2 finely mince fresh garlic canned
does<00:00:50.280> not<00:00:50.460> work<00:00:50.699> as<00:00:50.910> well<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> oils

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
does not work as well because the oils

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.010 
does not work as well because the oils
aren't<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.410> fresh

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.710 

step<00:00:58.020> 3<00:00:58.440> take<00:00:59.130> your<00:00:59.310> minced<00:00:59.640> fresh<00:01:00.120> garlic

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.050 
step 3 take your minced fresh garlic
stick<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.290> in<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:02.010> dry<00:01:02.370> lettuce<00:01:02.700> and

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
stick it right in your dry lettuce and

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.430 
stick it right in your dry lettuce and
then<00:01:03.390> you're<00:01:03.540> gonna<00:01:03.660> start<00:01:03.930> mixing<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
then you're gonna start mixing that

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.950 
then you're gonna start mixing that
around<00:01:04.770> gently<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.340> slowly<00:01:05.630> getting<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
around gently and slowly getting all the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
around gently and slowly getting all the
oil<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.680> garlic<00:01:08.160> onto<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> leaves

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
oil from that garlic onto the leaves

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090 
oil from that garlic onto the leaves
you're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.410> for<00:01:10.620> about<00:01:10.680> two

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you're going to do this for about two

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
you're going to do this for about two
minutes<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.730> when<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
minutes and when you actually think that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.500 
minutes and when you actually think that
you're<00:01:13.020> done<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.400> another<00:01:14.640> 30<00:01:15.000> seconds

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
you're done do it for another 30 seconds

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.510 
you're done do it for another 30 seconds
to<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.750> minute<00:01:15.950> because<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:16.980> want<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> make

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to a minute because you want to make

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.610 
to a minute because you want to make
sure<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.910> all<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.270> oil<00:01:18.480> gets<00:01:18.810> around<00:01:19.110> it's

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
sure that all that oil gets around it's

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.410 
sure that all that oil gets around it's
a<00:01:19.710> key<00:01:19.950> step<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:20.760> that<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> tastes

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.690 

oK<00:01:27.420> we've<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.900> completed<00:01:28.170> step<00:01:28.620> 3<00:01:29.040> we've

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
oK we've just completed step 3 we've

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.050 
oK we've just completed step 3 we've
been<00:01:30.150> mixing<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.500> garlic<00:01:32.370> around<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> dried

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
been mixing that garlic around the dried

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.520 
been mixing that garlic around the dried
lettuce<00:01:33.420> leaves<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.050> can<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.380> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
lettuce leaves and you can see it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.920 
lettuce leaves and you can see it's
become<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.160> bit<00:01:35.280> wilted<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.210> oil<00:01:36.420> from

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
become a little bit wilted the oil from

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
become a little bit wilted the oil from
that<00:01:37.440> garlic's<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.190> gotten<00:01:38.430> into<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that garlic's really gotten into the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.400 
that garlic's really gotten into the
leaves<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.050> really

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
leaves and that's gonna give it really

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.180 
leaves and that's gonna give it really
good<00:01:40.560> flavor

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
good flavor

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.690 
good flavor
so<00:01:41.729> step<00:01:42.630> four<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.290> olive<00:01:43.979> oil<00:01:44.160> you<00:01:44.340> really

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so step four is olive oil you really

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
so step four is olive oil you really
don't<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.060> much<00:01:45.350> really<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> couple<00:01:46.680> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
don't need much really a couple of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.700 
don't need much really a couple of
tablespoons<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.119> key<00:01:48.330> here<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.780> dress<00:01:49.410> less

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.940 
tablespoons the key here is dress less
toss<00:01:50.280> more<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.660> always<00:01:51.900> add<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.200> olive

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
bite to it that combines well with the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
bite to it that combines well with the
garlic<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.320> you're<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.830> keep<00:02:02.070> mixing

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.790 
sea salt
you<00:02:17.740> could<00:02:17.890> also<00:02:18.010> use<00:02:18.190> kosher<00:02:18.580> salt<00:02:19.800> and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
you could also use kosher salt and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.440 
you could also use kosher salt and
you're<00:02:21.010> going<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.700> continue<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.180> mix
