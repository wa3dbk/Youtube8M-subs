practices and and you know if you look
at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> time<00:01:35.820> frame<00:01:36.560> hopefully<00:01:37.560> hopefully

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
at the time frame hopefully hopefully

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.160 
at the time frame hopefully hopefully
ten<00:01:38.340> days<00:01:38.549> week<00:01:38.939> guys<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> road<00:01:39.840> next

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
ten days week guys are on the road next

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
ten days week guys are on the road next
week<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.460> time

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
week so that's I have a really good time

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.840 
week so that's I have a really good time
to<00:01:41.850> skate<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.210> by<00:01:42.390> myself<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.850> maybe

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to skate here by myself and and maybe

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
to skate here by myself and and maybe
then<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.270> team<00:01:45.479> comes<00:01:45.720> back<00:01:45.810> maybe<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.320> can

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
then when team comes back maybe I can

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.289 
then when team comes back maybe I can
practice<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> team<00:01:47.610> would<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> play<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
practice with the team would you play a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.139 
practice with the team would you play a
couple<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> games<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> Phantom's<00:01:49.649> then

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
couple of games with the Phantom's then

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.460 
couple of games with the Phantom's then
probably<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.960> wouldn't<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.170> minor

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
probably not then I wouldn't be minor

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.719 
probably not then I wouldn't be minor
since<00:01:52.770> 98<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:55.549> we<00:01:56.549> haven't

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
since 98 so I don't know we haven't

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.149 
since 98 so I don't know we haven't
talked<00:01:57.030> about<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
talked about that but you know if you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.420 
talked about that but you know if you
ask<00:01:59.340> my<00:01:59.490> opinion<00:01:59.520> probably<00:02:00.270> not
