by any means but still it does look like
it<00:03:23.260> could<00:03:23.410> dampen<00:03:23.650> some<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.130> recovery

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
it could dampen some of the recovery

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.099 
it could dampen some of the recovery
efforts<00:03:24.910> out<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.239> as<00:03:25.329> people<00:03:25.600> continue<00:03:25.750> to

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
efforts out here as people continue to

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.199 
efforts out here as people continue to
struggle<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.650> clean<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> pieces<00:03:27.609> we

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
struggle to clean up the pieces we

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.849 
struggle to clean up the pieces we
actually<00:03:28.480> take<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.660> look<00:03:28.870> at<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.019> gfs<00:03:29.440> outlook

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
actually take a look at the gfs outlook

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.680 
actually take a look at the gfs outlook
we<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.130> see<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.519> storm<00:03:30.820> system<00:03:31.269> both<00:03:31.480> for

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
we can see the storm system both for

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.240 
we can see the storm system both for
continuing<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.230> push<00:03:32.470> off<00:03:32.650> your<00:03:32.680> towards<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
continuing to push off your towards the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.830 
continuing to push off your towards the
northwest<00:03:33.549> near<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.150> bottom<00:03:34.299> of<00:03:34.510> your<00:03:34.660> screen

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
northwest near the bottom of your screen

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.050 
northwest near the bottom of your screen
then<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.739> starts<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.070> linger<00:03:36.489> there<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
then it just starts to linger there and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.759 
then it just starts to linger there and
actually<00:03:37.359> lingers<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:37.959> quite<00:03:38.140> some<00:03:38.350> time<00:03:38.380> but

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
actually lingers for quite some time but

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.340 
actually lingers for quite some time but
over<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.100> next<00:03:39.220> 24<00:03:39.760> hours<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.570> does<00:03:40.870> slightly

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
over the next 24 hours it does slightly

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.720 
over the next 24 hours it does slightly
pick<00:03:41.530> up<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.829> area<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:42.160> convection<00:03:42.489> I'm

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
pick up in that area of convection I'm

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.640 
pick up in that area of convection I'm
actually<00:03:42.850> go<00:03:43.090> into<00:03:43.239> Friday<00:03:43.690> some<00:03:44.380> rain

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
actually go into Friday some rain

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.349 
actually go into Friday some rain
showers<00:03:44.680> popping<00:03:45.280> up<00:03:45.459> across<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.760> size<00:03:46.120> and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
showers popping up across the size and

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.509 
showers popping up across the size and
Mindanao<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.859> does<00:03:48.070> look<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.459> is

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
Mindanao so it does look like it is

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.580 
Mindanao so it does look like it is
going<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.790> be<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:49.030> wet<00:03:49.359> start<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.140> week<00:03:50.350> and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
going to be a wet start of the week and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.470 
going to be a wet start of the week and
out<00:03:50.709> there<00:03:50.920> as<00:03:51.100> people<00:03:51.430> continue<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:52.180> recover

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
out there as people continue to recover

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.370 
out there as people continue to recover
but<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.470> forecast<00:03:53.799> for<00:03:54.280> bopha<00:03:55.030> going<00:03:55.959> into

but the forecast for bopha going into

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.960 
but the forecast for bopha going into
the<00:03:56.560> weekend<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:57.430> eventually<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:57.910> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the weekend and then eventually in the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.759 
the weekend and then eventually in the
next<00:03:58.209> week<00:03:58.420> still<00:03:58.810> lingering<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.440> this

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
next week still lingering in this

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.530 
next week still lingering in this
particular<00:04:00.160> model<00:04:00.579> actually<00:04:01.060> expects<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.510> to

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
particular model actually expects it to

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.940 
particular model actually expects it to
start<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.989> dissipate<00:04:02.470> out<00:04:02.650> here<00:04:02.859> and

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
start to dissipate out here and

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.280 
start to dissipate out here and
eventually<00:04:03.370> just<00:04:03.519> weakens<00:04:03.970> out<00:04:04.150> with<00:04:04.720> no<00:04:05.019> land

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
eventually just weakens out with no land

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.039 
eventually just weakens out with no land
fall<00:04:05.650> into<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.100> Philippines<00:04:06.549> or<00:04:06.700> Vietnam<00:04:07.540> so

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
fall into the Philippines or Vietnam so

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.289 
fall into the Philippines or Vietnam so
that<00:04:08.200> would<00:04:08.319> be<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.799> best<00:04:08.829> case<00:04:09.579> scenario

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
that would be the best case scenario

that would be the best case scenario

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
scenario that could develop up here but

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.940 
scenario that could develop up here but
for<00:05:00.970> now<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.170> official<00:05:02.260> tracks<00:05:02.800> from

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
for now this is the official tracks from

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.530 
for now this is the official tracks from
the<00:05:03.040> Japan<00:05:03.370> Meteorological<00:05:03.640> Agency<00:05:04.120> and

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
the Japan Meteorological Agency and

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.360 
the Japan Meteorological Agency and
remember<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.260> long<00:05:05.530> range<00:05:05.830> here<00:05:06.040> this<00:05:06.220> is

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
remember the long range here this is

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.600 
remember the long range here this is
actually<00:05:06.520> going<00:05:06.910> into<00:05:07.360> Monday<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.800> still<00:05:09.340> a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
actually going into Monday so still a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.640 
actually going into Monday so still a
long<00:05:10.000> time<00:05:10.330> out<00:05:10.360> here<00:05:10.690> continue<00:05:11.140> to<00:05:11.230> watch<00:05:11.410> the

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
long time out here continue to watch the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.200 
long time out here continue to watch the
storm<00:05:11.920> system<00:05:12.100> as<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.400> pushes<00:05:12.760> off<00:05:13.030> here

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
storm system as it pushes off here

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.030 
storm system as it pushes off here
towards<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.660> northwest<00:05:13.960> but<00:05:14.380> my<00:05:14.530> thoughts<00:05:14.860> it

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
towards the northwest but my thoughts it

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.080 
towards the northwest but my thoughts it
is<00:05:15.130> going<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.370> continue<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.760> move<00:05:15.910> here

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
is going to continue to move here

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.970 
is going to continue to move here
towards<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.510> northwest<00:05:16.840> basically<00:05:17.680> maintain

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
towards the northwest basically maintain

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.370 
towards the northwest basically maintain
its<00:05:18.820> intensity<00:05:19.450> has<00:05:19.750> right<00:05:19.960> now<00:05:20.080> do<00:05:20.140> not

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
its intensity has right now do not

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.530 
its intensity has right now do not
expect<00:05:20.740> this<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.070> all<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.910> start<00:05:22.390> to

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
expect this and all to start to

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.390 
expect this and all to start to
re-strengthen<00:05:22.990> into<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.500> monster<00:05:23.890> of<00:05:24.310> a

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
re-strengthen into a monster of a

re-strengthen into a monster of a
