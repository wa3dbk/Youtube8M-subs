00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.250
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.170
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.099
 let's analyze the cullen shoes and 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.150
 the tr2 the crankcase in tr2 as you know 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.900
 you know kalenjin is the house of the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.590
 chain decathlon sports brands 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.550
 and that some time ago it was decided 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.580
 make slippers including sneakers 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.730
 of trail and here we have the tr2 a 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.640
 pretty inexpensive shoe one 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 mid-range shoe for decathlon 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.619
 for trail running 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.500
 We are opening a little to teach you 

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:50.570
 but the first thing we're going to teach you 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.570
 is the sole as you see 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.579
 these studs in the outer parts 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.890
 always favoring the displacement 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.960
 forward throughout this part 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.050
 front while in the part 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.200
 back already prevent what would be the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.650
 skid when we hit with the heel 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 on the ground especially the most 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.750
 later with a cut here you see it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.150
 totally against the grain 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.730
 so that when we go down bread does not skid 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.920
 the shoe on the ground to the touch 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.190
 the sole we do not see that it takes a lot no 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 We see it to be a very rubber 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.320
 adherent like other brands that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 they use what they call as 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.300
 stickers to see as rubber on hooks like that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.360
 it is not the same harder rubber as you see 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.810
 cushioning and a profile 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.990
 especially super super exaggerated profile 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.040
 as you notice there are almost 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.440
 three profile fingers is a lot in this 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.100
 damping profile a control of 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.560
 super exaggerated pronation is a 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.679
 Slippers fixed on the inside more 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.390
 profile yet a shoe totally 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.250
 designed for programmers with this 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.670
 stability control control 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.370
 pronation of hard plastic yes 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.959
 Kalenjin has been concerned to put a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.300
 a rubber band because if we step on stone 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.970
 in this part so that it does not skid so much 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.520
 the lack of these two laterals here 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.860
 but good 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.780
 as you see here what I was saying to you 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.500
 very high sole profile and here 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.170
 up front not so much for any 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.030
 another model would be pretty but 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.510
 compared to the back is not 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.460
 much therefore there is a drop more or 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 less medium we could say a drop 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.710
 which is the fall from behind towards 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.990
 forward more or less median also 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.900
 a lot of profile in the front and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.510
 will have to see if this profile all the whole 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.330
 this material translates into 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.790
 damping that does not always happen 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.980
 although there is a lot or a lot of material 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.980
 it means that it always dampens 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.010
 we'll see when we approve 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.840
 we will explain it to you so 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.150
 makes referent reference to the upper 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.330
 as you see protections in the part 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.190
 front some skin nerves 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.069
 synthetic and some tapes here that go to 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.400
 those that are caught the laces part 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.310
 front and on the sides in the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.180
 side to catch all this part of 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.719
 here 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.690
 let's put your hand in the shoe 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.530
 understands 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.530
 we'll see 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.549
 in principle the front does not have 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.489
 a lot of support but if all this part 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.260
 yes we noticed that the shoe holds 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.060
 quite 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.280
 we noticed the drop in this part of here 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.630
 we are quite down while 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.590
 we are going up we are going up 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.590
 up to the heel 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.110
 let's see the tab first one 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.150
 simple tab you see it with not much 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.340
 perforated material to favor the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 perspiration 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.240
 cords pass by this tape 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.199
 enmedio so they do not move much the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.780
 cords that are semi flat somewhat 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.740
 elastic so you see if it comes up 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.800
 also or not 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.310
 maybe we like more laces more 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.180
 rigid so they do not move so much 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.260
 and here the tongue without any fabric for 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.810
 avoid entry 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.480
 external elements we do not have to 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.880
 forget why that is a very slipper 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.990
 cheap very affordable 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.150
 Thus 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.169
 we have to always keep that in mind 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.919
 let's see it inside 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.110
 here you see the heel more or less padded 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.289
 very closed from here to the back 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.919
 what will also favor the 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:22.789
 foot support the seams enough 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.789
 well concealed 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.099
 I think we're not going to have any 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:33.389
 problem on the inside is very 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.889
 well here you see the seams despite 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.759
 that they will look pretty are very good 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.759
 disguised well 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.259
 the heel too much structure a lot 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:47.550
 Chassis for this heel with plastics 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:50.220
 hard high relief as you can see that 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.949
 highlight more everything and that the number of the 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.400
 sneaker is great fixes 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.009
 here we are almost already touching a bit the 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.770
 mid-mountain boot 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:06.979
 with this part of the heel going up so much 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.849
 with the chassis chassis up here the heel 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:14.569
 certainly for runners that can be 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:17.659
 of a little high weight I do not dare to 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:21.639
 say heavy but if something high in 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:25.560
 As for la la la 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:28.200
 the template did not come out 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.230
 material that we have our doubts 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.820
 about how you are going to behave with the step 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.410
 of the kilometers, maybe there's a lot of 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.430
 phage but a lot of material in the part 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.440
 back and quite also thick or 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.350
 moderately thick in the part 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.630
 front we will have to see what we say with 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:49.639
 the passage of kilometers if this 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.639
 material that was very smelly 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.820
 You will see that putting your hand gives a good 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.270
 feeling of comfort all and that the 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.920
 Sneaker is pretty high enough 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:08.800
 heavy too 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:11.830
 and with enough rude we could say with 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.990
 a lot of chassis on all this control of 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.700
 training that makes it very much about 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.980
 all on the inside part since it has 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.980
 that raise the middle soles a lot 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:26.540
 Well, good friends, here you have it 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:28.370
 with tapes that also travel throughout 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.490
 the horizontal part and they're going to stop at 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.960
 the laces a bit to favor for 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.090
 the support of the foot 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:41.610
 This slipper from the Kalenjin house 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:44.009
 they start in tr2 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.629
 the very cheap side perhaps for 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.960
 start a bit in the practice of 

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:52.200
 trail running and see what is this that 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.740
 some is driving us crazy 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.720
 tr2 cullen already analyzed by running 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.110
 review dotcom see you in the next 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.110
 analysis
