00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
very effective in humidity and

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.820 
very effective in humidity and
reactivates<00:05:34.729> with<00:05:35.089> water<00:05:35.569> pretty<00:05:36.409> much<00:05:36.499> if

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
reactivates with water pretty much if

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.920 
reactivates with water pretty much if
you've<00:05:36.979> applied<00:05:37.460> this<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:38.089> day<00:05:38.240> before<00:05:38.270> and

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
you've applied this the day before and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.269 
you've applied this the day before and
you<00:05:39.050> just<00:05:39.229> spritz<00:05:39.499> your<00:05:39.649> hair<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.949> next<00:05:40.039> thing

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
you just spritz your hair the next thing

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.249 
you just spritz your hair the next thing
with<00:05:40.430> water<00:05:40.639> it<00:05:40.879> reactivates<00:05:41.539> so<00:05:42.080> that's

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
with water it reactivates so that's

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.489 
with water it reactivates so that's
really<00:05:42.409> good<00:05:42.710> that<00:05:42.740> basically<00:05:43.629> gives<00:05:44.629> you<00:05:44.870> the

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:45.499 
really good that basically gives you the

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.529 
really good that basically gives you the
opportunity<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:46.069> not<00:05:46.370> apply<00:05:46.729> as<00:05:46.969> much<00:05:47.149> part<00:05:47.449> of

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
opportunity to not apply as much part of

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.469 
opportunity to not apply as much part of
this<00:05:47.689> you<00:05:47.839> did<00:05:48.020> on<00:05:48.229> the<00:05:48.259> first<00:05:48.589> day<00:05:48.949> so<00:05:49.699> I<00:05:50.120> think

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479
