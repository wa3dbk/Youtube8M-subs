RO<00:00:53.879> water<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.300> needed<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.039> going

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
RO water is needed so this is just going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
RO water is needed so this is just going
to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> fresh<00:00:57.030> water<00:00:57.239> tank<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.260> there's<00:00:58.559> only

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to be a fresh water tank so there's only

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.790 
to be a fresh water tank so there's only
an<00:00:58.920> RO<00:00:59.070> no<00:01:00.059> d<00:01:00.300> ionizing<00:01:01.020> we're<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.469> going

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
an RO no d ionizing we're not going

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.969 
an RO no d ionizing we're not going
ro/di<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.960> Spectre<00:01:04.320> purest<00:01:04.619> product

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
ro/di so this is Spectre purest product

tall 48 wide 18 deep I think in normal
90<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.630> only<00:01:51.750> 27<00:01:52.259> tall<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.829> i'm<00:01:52.950> calling<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
90 is only 27 tall so i'm calling this a

90 is only 27 tall so i'm calling this a
100<00:01:53.700> gallon<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:55.110> i'm<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.350> positive<00:01:55.409> that's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
100 gallon but i'm not positive that's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
100 gallon but i'm not positive that's
what<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:57.659> doesn't<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.049> matter

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
what it is it doesn't really matter

with an anti safe and on the inside show

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.390 
with an anti safe and on the inside show
a<00:02:26.660> little<00:02:26.780> bit<00:02:26.960> more<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> minute<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
a little bit more that in a minute the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.100 
a little bit more that in a minute the
ta's<00:02:28.610> helps<00:02:29.120> take<00:02:29.300> water<00:02:29.510> off<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> bottom

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.600 
ta's helps take water off the bottom
which<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.230> kind<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.590> more<00:02:30.740> important<00:02:31.190> with

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
which is kind of more important with

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.730 
which is kind of more important with
fresh<00:02:31.820> water<00:02:31.970> than<00:02:32.240> salt<00:02:32.510> water<00:02:32.720> because<00:02:33.560> not

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
fresh water than salt water because not

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
fresh water than salt water because not
all<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:34.040> fresh<00:02:34.220> water<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:35.200> des<00:02:36.200> trous<00:02:36.760> rises

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
all the fresh water the des trous rises

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
all the fresh water the des trous rises
to<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.880> top<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.300> salt<00:02:38.600> water<00:02:38.660> does<00:02:38.960> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
to the top like in salt water does so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.420 
to the top like in salt water does so
you<00:02:39.740> got<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.950> get<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.070> little<00:02:40.190> bit<00:02:40.310> of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
you got to get a little bit of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.210 
you got to get a little bit of
subsurface<00:02:41.000> skimming<00:02:41.420> as<00:02:41.480> well<00:02:41.660> so<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.410> course

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
subsurface skimming as well so I course

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.100 
subsurface skimming as well so I course
inside<00:02:43.580> there<00:02:43.910> I've<00:02:44.210> got<00:02:44.450> all<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.900> way<00:02:44.990> across

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
inside there I've got all the way across

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.220 
inside there I've got all the way across
Coast<00:02:45.680> coast<00:02:45.980> fluff<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.300> it's<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.660> router<00:02:48.050> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
Coast coast fluff so it's a router to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.530 
Coast coast fluff so it's a router to
whole<00:02:48.380> way<00:02:48.500> across<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> I'm<00:02:49.940> tricky<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.390> see

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
whole way across so I'm tricky to see

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.540 
whole way across so I'm tricky to see

and then breaking asleep and when you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.960 
and then breaking asleep and when you
need<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.740> so<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.160> probably<00:03:55.430> too<00:03:55.610> complicated

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
need it so it's probably too complicated

out of my sump as possible to try and
limit<00:05:10.050> my<00:05:10.199> some<00:05:10.680> flux<00:05:11.039> so<00:05:11.610> I've<00:05:11.759> built<00:05:11.940> my

limit my some flux so I've built my

blocks down here with my own electrical

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.070 
blocks down here with my own electrical
so<00:05:14.520> I've<00:05:14.639> plumbed<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.060> outlet<00:05:15.389> line<00:05:15.630> over<00:05:15.960> to

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.740 
so I've plumbed it outlet line over to
the<00:05:16.169> wall<00:05:16.319> she's<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.770> GFI<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.490> there's<00:05:17.639> my<00:05:17.849> 38

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
the wall she's a GFI and there's my 38

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.830 
the wall she's a GFI and there's my 38
um<00:05:19.669> drain<00:05:20.669> line<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.060> my<00:05:21.120> quarter<00:05:21.419> inch<00:05:21.539> supply

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
out of a freezer and refrigerator so

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.320 
out of a freezer and refrigerator so
coming<00:05:34.080> back<00:05:34.229> over<00:05:34.469> here<00:05:34.710> looking<00:05:35.580> at<00:05:35.729> the

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
coming back over here looking at the

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.850 
coming back over here looking at the
neat<00:05:36.479> thing<00:05:36.719> at<00:05:36.840> this<00:05:36.960> thang<00:05:37.229> as<00:05:37.409> I've<00:05:37.680> got<00:05:37.830> a

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
neat thing at this thang as I've got a

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.610 
neat thing at this thang as I've got a
power<00:05:38.099> jandi<00:05:38.840> valve<00:05:39.840> what<00:05:40.080> you<00:05:40.169> usually<00:05:40.320> found

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
power jandi valve what you usually found

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.189 
power jandi valve what you usually found
on<00:05:40.740> swimming<00:05:40.949> pools<00:05:41.300> that's<00:05:42.300> actuated<00:05:43.050> from

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
on swimming pools that's actuated from

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.870 
on swimming pools that's actuated from
the<00:05:43.289> switch<00:05:43.500> above<00:05:43.770> so<00:05:44.340> like<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.550> said<00:05:44.669> when<00:05:44.820> you

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
the switch above so like I said when you

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.120 
the switch above so like I said when you
want<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.090> feed<00:05:45.599> them<00:05:45.840> you<00:05:46.050> can<00:05:46.229> flip<00:05:46.889> it<00:05:46.979> all

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
want to feed them you can flip it all

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.040 
want to feed them you can flip it all
the<00:05:47.250> way<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.370> 180<00:05:47.880> it'll<00:05:48.210> close<00:05:48.389> off<00:05:48.719> the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
the way to 180 it'll close off the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.830 
the way to 180 it'll close off the
display<00:05:49.289> loop<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:49.949> open<00:05:50.280> up<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.639> closed<00:05:51.570> loop

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
display loop and open up the closed loop

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.330 
display loop and open up the closed loop
for<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.139> filtration<00:05:52.530> system<00:05:52.949> and<00:05:53.070> let<00:05:53.159> it<00:05:53.190> run

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
for the filtration system and let it run

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.770 
for the filtration system and let it run
as<00:05:53.550> long<00:05:53.729> as<00:05:53.849> you<00:05:53.940> want<00:05:54.120> it<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.449> can<00:05:54.569> stop

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
as long as you want it and you can stop

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.360 
as long as you want it and you can stop
it<00:05:54.930> anyway<00:05:55.199> intermittent<00:05:55.740> so<00:05:56.159> you<00:05:56.250> could

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
it anyway intermittent so you could

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.969 
it anyway intermittent so you could
reduce<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.639> flow<00:05:56.969> to<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.180> display<00:05:57.569> to<00:05:58.199> 50<00:05:58.590> 50

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
reduce the flow to the display to 50 50

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.649 
reduce the flow to the display to 50 50
at<00:05:59.580> any<00:05:59.789> point<00:05:59.969> and<00:06:00.210> it<00:06:00.330> doesn't<00:06:00.569> really

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
at any point and it doesn't really

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.180 
at any point and it doesn't really
affect<00:06:00.780> with<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.259> beam<00:06:01.409> animal<00:06:01.710> system<00:06:01.979> early

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
affect with the beam animal system early

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.279 
affect with the beam animal system early
doesn't<00:06:02.430> affect<00:06:02.729> how<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.300> filter<00:06:03.900> goes<00:06:04.020> makes

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
doesn't affect how the filter goes makes

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.390 
doesn't affect how the filter goes makes
a<00:06:04.349> little<00:06:04.440> bit<00:06:04.620> more<00:06:04.740> noise<00:06:05.039> you'd<00:06:05.219> have<00:06:05.310> to

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
a little bit more noise you'd have to

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.270 
a little bit more noise you'd have to
readjust<00:06:05.580> your<00:06:05.880> your<00:06:06.810> flow<00:06:07.110> siphon<00:06:07.620> but<00:06:07.800> short

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
readjust your your flow siphon but short

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.219 
readjust your your flow siphon but short
of<00:06:08.340> that<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.490> mean<00:06:08.669> it's<00:06:09.419> just<00:06:09.659> nice<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:09.870> be<00:06:10.169> able

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
of that I mean it's just nice to be able

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.469 
of that I mean it's just nice to be able
to<00:06:10.409> feed<00:06:10.620> and<00:06:11.039> or<00:06:11.430> if<00:06:11.729> you<00:06:11.819> introduce<00:06:11.969> new<00:06:12.270> fish

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479

whatever<00:06:12.750> cut<00:06:13.199> that<00:06:13.319> display<00:06:13.710> down<00:06:13.949> I<00:06:14.219> may

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
whatever cut that display down I may

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.279 
whatever cut that display down I may
even<00:06:14.969> put<00:06:15.210> it<00:06:15.300> on<00:06:15.360> a<00:06:15.389> timer<00:06:15.599> and<00:06:15.810> just<00:06:16.080> cut<00:06:16.199> it

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
even put it on a timer and just cut it

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.870 
even put it on a timer and just cut it
down<00:06:16.349> every<00:06:16.620> night<00:06:16.800> so<00:06:16.979> they<00:06:17.099> have<00:06:17.219> calm<00:06:17.610> flow

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
down every night so they have calm flow

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.629 
down every night so they have calm flow
at<00:06:18.000> night<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.389> more<00:06:18.780> flow<00:06:18.930> during<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.229> day

else's<00:06:44.670> um<00:06:45.530> porous<00:06:46.530> plates<00:06:46.830> and<00:06:47.240> that's<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.390> 8

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
else's um porous plates and that's the 8

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.880 
else's um porous plates and that's the 8
inch<00:06:48.780> by<00:06:48.930> inch<00:06:48.960> by<00:06:49.200> one<00:06:49.470> inch<00:06:49.500> plate<00:06:49.770> I'm

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
inch by inch by one inch plate I'm

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.050 
inch by inch by one inch plate I'm
really<00:06:50.070> excited<00:06:50.250> about<00:06:50.430> trying<00:06:50.670> to<00:06:50.760> use<00:06:50.880> that

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
really excited about trying to use that

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.360 
really excited about trying to use that
for<00:06:51.270> my<00:06:51.390> biological<00:06:51.780> filtration<00:06:52.370> it'll

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
for my biological filtration it'll

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.010 
for my biological filtration it'll
probably<00:06:53.580> won't<00:06:53.790> keep<00:06:54.060> the<00:06:54.270> bioballs<00:06:54.720> and

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
probably won't keep the bioballs and

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.960 
probably won't keep the bioballs and
really<00:06:55.170> not<00:06:55.320> that<00:06:55.500> excited<00:06:55.680> about<00:06:56.130> that<00:06:56.370> then

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
really not that excited about that then

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.670 
really not that excited about that then
the<00:06:57.090> second<00:06:57.450> tank<00:06:57.600> over<00:06:57.870> here<00:06:58.080> is<00:06:58.170> where<00:06:58.500> the

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
the second tank over here is where the

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.890 
the second tank over here is where the
main<00:06:58.860> water<00:06:59.070> drops<00:06:59.460> into<00:06:59.670> first<00:07:00.030> and<00:07:00.300> that'll

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
main water drops into first and that'll

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.780 
main water drops into first and that'll
also<00:07:01.050> give<00:07:01.170> me<00:07:01.320> a<00:07:01.440> refugium<00:07:01.770> setup<00:07:02.190> or<00:07:02.430> large

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
also give me a refugium setup or large

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.790 
also give me a refugium setup or large
protein<00:07:03.270> skimmer<00:07:03.630> area<00:07:03.930> later<00:07:04.170> right<00:07:04.500> now<00:07:04.530> i'm

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
protein skimmer area later right now i'm

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.380 
protein skimmer area later right now i'm
just<00:07:04.890> going<00:07:05.070> to<00:07:05.100> use<00:07:05.160> it<00:07:05.340> as<00:07:05.460> a<00:07:05.610> sick<00:07:06.150> tank

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
just going to use it as a sick tank

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.530 
just going to use it as a sick tank
hatchery<00:07:06.930> tank<00:07:07.170> just<00:07:08.160> need<00:07:08.730> more<00:07:08.850> water<00:07:09.060> so

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
hatchery tank just need more water so

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.510 
hatchery tank just need more water so
let<00:07:10.170> me<00:07:10.230> hit<00:07:10.380> pause<00:07:10.590> and<00:07:10.620> I'm<00:07:11.130> moving<00:07:11.370> on<00:07:11.400> the

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
let me hit pause and I'm moving on the

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.760 
let me hit pause and I'm moving on the
