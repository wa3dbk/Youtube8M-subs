to aim to build their bikes up into it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.170 
to aim to build their bikes up into it's
how<00:00:57.390> we'd<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.110> bikes<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.650> for<00:00:59.460> 2014

how we'd like our bikes to be for 2014
we've<00:01:00.629> taken<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.050> five<00:01:01.260> bigger<00:01:02.120> twenty-seven

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
we've taken the five bigger twenty-seven

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.380 
we've taken the five bigger twenty-seven
and<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.269> half<00:01:03.480> inch<00:01:03.750> wheels<00:01:04.820> we<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and a half inch wheels we think that the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
and a half inch wheels we think that the
this<00:01:06.869> isn't<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.500> marketing<00:01:08.040> gimmick

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
for us it means we can do some extra

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.719 
for us it means we can do some extra
things<00:01:10.440> with<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> bike<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> wanted<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
things with the bike that we wanted to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.790 
things with the bike that we wanted to
do<00:01:11.910> for<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> while<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:13.259> can<00:01:13.410> make<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.649> bike

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
do for a while you can make the bike

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.999 
do for a while you can make the bike
longer<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> angles<00:01:15.899> we<00:01:16.080> want<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
longer we can get the angles we want and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.290 
longer we can get the angles we want and
we<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.490> extra<00:01:17.880> grip<00:01:18.090> that's

we can get the extra grip that's

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.529 
we can get the extra grip that's
slightly<00:01:18.750> bigger<00:01:18.960> contact<00:01:19.440> patch<00:01:19.619> plug-in<00:01:20.539> so

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
slightly bigger contact patch plug-in so

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.529 
slightly bigger contact patch plug-in so
this<00:01:21.690> is<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.899> prototype<00:01:22.640> all<00:01:23.640> our<00:01:23.940> prototypes

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
of a bit far out there but we're kind of

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.430 
of a bit far out there but we're kind of
like<00:01:34.970> playing<00:01:35.300> with<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:35.720> you're<00:01:36.320> like

pushing the edges it's a lot of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.510 
pushing the edges it's a lot of
interesting<00:01:39.050> stuff<00:01:39.230> going<00:01:39.290> on<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:39.830> this<00:01:39.980> that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
interesting stuff going on on this that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.670 
interesting stuff going on on this that
derives<00:01:41.420> from<00:01:41.600> other<00:01:41.960> technology<00:01:42.530> we've

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
derives from other technology we've

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.860 
derives from other technology we've
developed<00:01:42.710> they<00:01:43.700> kind<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:44.000> place<00:01:44.450> with<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.660> few

developed they kind of place with a few

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.810 
developed they kind of place with a few
new<00:01:45.080> ideas<00:01:45.260> as<00:01:45.680> well<00:01:45.890> which<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.250> might<00:01:46.460> see<00:01:46.520> in

model in three two - this was one
machined<00:01:57.400> piece<00:01:57.730> on<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.720> model<00:01:59.020> we've<00:01:59.260> got

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
machined piece on this model we've got

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.110 
machined piece on this model we've got
teachers<00:01:59.590> taking<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.100> monocoque<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.030> then

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
teachers taking the monocoque and then

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.370 
teachers taking the monocoque and then
pierced<00:02:01.570> it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
pierced it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.999 
pierced it
the<00:02:03.860> backend<00:02:04.310> sports<00:02:05.330> ririn<00:02:06.229> that's<00:02:06.470> kind<00:02:06.950> of

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
the backend sports ririn that's kind of

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.169 
the backend sports ririn that's kind of
similar<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.460> what<00:02:07.549> we've<00:02:07.640> got<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.030> Alpine

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
similar to what we've got on the Alpine

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.650 
similar to what we've got on the Alpine
160<00:02:09.170> obviously<00:02:09.709> got<00:02:10.340> 29<00:02:10.789> inch<00:02:11.000> wheels<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.450> here

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
160 obviously got 29 inch wheels in here

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.710 
160 obviously got 29 inch wheels in here
so<00:02:12.440> playing<00:02:13.400> with<00:02:13.550> ideas<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.970> stiffness<00:02:14.600> and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
so playing with ideas of stiffness and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.059 
so playing with ideas of stiffness and
what<00:02:14.840> we<00:02:14.930> can<00:02:15.080> do<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> bike<00:02:15.709> with<00:02:15.950> this

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
what we can do with a bike with this

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.440 
what we can do with a bike with this
much<00:02:16.280> travel<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.850> Lister<00:02:17.120> carrying<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
much travel and Lister carrying the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.230 
much travel and Lister carrying the
capability
