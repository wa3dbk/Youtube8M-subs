00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.520
 this man believes in his vision 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.150
 it is new it has set itself the goal of building and thus the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.280
 Revolutionizing the environmental performance of motor vehicles over the past 16 years 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.080
 Morning gained a lot of experience in using high-tech materials and materials 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.080
 developed his idea over time 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.310
 But not only no trouble should occur 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.509
 where in Scandinavia I have in addition to various other companies 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.430
 also worked in the aircraft industry there I learned the Hanika am 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.140
 Technology campus in the case of aluminum and special adhesive had to be used 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.750
 should be light and extremely stable high tech material are in the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.720
 Aviation industry, of course, quite common 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.390
 and I immediately felt that this technology was urgently needed 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.130
 Automotive industry must be made accessible as well as weight here 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.460
 suddenly a topic became as approx 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.770
 as 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.740
 and get ripped children 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.710
 looking for a cheap and widespread 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.320
 material 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.080
 finally, on the podium, he wanted to abruptly 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 which motto mobile building has long been used 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.560
 I live it is because the Seitenbandriss initially was probably only for 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.130
 Bumper used Â»but meanwhile it is also very important for the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.480
 Pedestrian safety com and weight reduction trends are coming to 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.170
 Example, can see benches want to clarify 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.890
 as well as on its back in the next ten years is recorded there 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 is from the chora 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.090
 one for the Internet through the connection of Orco with aluminum in the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.030
 so-called sandwich construction succeeded in three games a material 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 because in addition to its lightness also a variety of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.960
 bring along three properties 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.880
 because with the xetra technology it is possible for us to make a dent 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.820
 which leather can stick so we get a very light but 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.830
 stable construction could 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.619
 the use of the area between the aluminum bars is also conceivable 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.820
 for the channeling of air streams again heating air 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.490
 the individual parts can be put together and glued together 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.000
 Without expensive tools, a variety of designs can be realized 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.079
 what you attach particular importance to the Red Bull is the 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.799
 Environmental compatibility of the entire production 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.379
 we have a barge with two glued side panels bow the core 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.050
 consists of a gully being made of aluminum or steel 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.380
 both parts are 100 percent recyclable 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.849
 the possible weight reduction in the construction of a vehicle lock 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.859
 It also helps to protect the environment 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.859
 less weight at the same time consume less fuel 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.790
 By weight loss you can reduce the co2 output lap 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.789
 Ricoh is a weight savings of up to 30 percent 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.870
 but packed, the items of a treasure can be sent inexpensively 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.730
 and then quickly and easily assembled on site 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.889
 The developers are not guilty of proving this 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.200
 for them we have this chance we open in just 13 weekend and built it 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.839
 is now installed in our producer and we can drive around with it 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.879
 short development time space available worldwide materials such as aluminum 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.119
 and a pool in more no longer consuming and expensive welding 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.779
 The controller punching but simply the inexpensive lock they parts 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.149
 zusammengehcken and stick it all together with massive weight saving and the 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.149
 associated environmental impact 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.699
 but under pressure why Romand we still have a real car on the 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.370
 Street 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.660
 but we work together with a well-known European manufacturer and 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.519
 then in the near future with the development of a completely new 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.019
 Vehicle start 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.929
 why increase again 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.729
 one of the two perpetrators 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.989
 Of course, this raises the question of stability 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.799
 even passenger compartments must eventually become extremely resilient and 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.569
 be these constructions 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.659
 in record-breaking recognized violates passed and seems 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.659
 in spite of lightweight construction, prepared for the requirements of the manufacturer 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:07.879
 Rooney only gave him points, we have with the manufacturer of this AKIK 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.139
 including him and some of his partners have told us 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.799
 that the driving characteristics improved a lot but a lot overall 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.400
 modern living comfort 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.739
 Como morning 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.289
 So you can be curious with which manufacturer tomorrow will be his team 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.240
 work together 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.990
 maybe he'll let this prototype go to Enrico 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.320
 already a conclusion on it
