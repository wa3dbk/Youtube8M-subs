have done that in the first place but I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
don't want to be an ass to the other two

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
don't want to be an ass to the other two
people<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.540> where<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.860> rules

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
people that got a right where the rules

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
people that got a right where the rules
were<00:01:08.310> already<00:01:08.430> set<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.330> over<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
were already set and they get over the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 
were already set and they get over the
first<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.909> think<00:01:11.909> about<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.510> fair

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
first two I think about it's not fair

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
first two I think about it's not fair
because<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.060> people<00:01:15.180> are

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
because you know a lot of people are

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.450 
because you know a lot of people are
different<00:01:15.750> time<00:01:16.140> zones<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> stuff<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
different time zones and stuff and you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
different time zones and stuff and you
know<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.729> saying<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.780> whoever's<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
know what I'm saying there whoever's up

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
know what I'm saying there whoever's up
that<00:01:20.220> earlier<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.840> whatever<00:01:22.470> time<00:01:23.009> zones

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that earlier it's whatever time zones

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.020 
that earlier it's whatever time zones
are<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:25.369> next<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
are so next time it's going to be

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.370 
are so next time it's going to be
drawing<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.540> probably<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> start<00:01:28.259> doing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
drawing I probably going to start doing

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.249 
drawing I probably going to start doing
that<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:29.299> just<00:01:30.299> doing<00:01:30.509> drawings<00:01:30.720> whether<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that now just doing drawings whether it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
that now just doing drawings whether it
be<00:01:31.380> guessing<00:01:31.680> things<00:01:32.130> whoever<00:01:32.549> gets<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
be guessing things whoever gets is the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.109 
be guessing things whoever gets is the
right<00:01:33.420> answer<00:01:33.689> would<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.829> into<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> drawing<00:01:35.700> or

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
right answer would be into a drawing or

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
right answer would be into a drawing or
whatever<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.799> something

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
whatever I'm going to think of something

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.600 
whatever I'm going to think of something
but<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.729> drawing<00:01:39.180> from<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
but it's going to be drawing from now on

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
but it's going to be drawing from now on
drawings<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.060> correct<00:01:42.299> answer<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.259> 16

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
drawings but the correct answer was 16

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.270 
drawings but the correct answer was 16
and<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.280> half<00:01:44.570> size<00:01:45.570> 16<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> half<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.040> ring

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and a half size 16 and a half is my ring

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.039 
and a half size 16 and a half is my ring
size<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.909> remember<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.509> fitted<00:01:51.930> for
