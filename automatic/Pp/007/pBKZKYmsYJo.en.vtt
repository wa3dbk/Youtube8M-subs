00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello UTB dsm quest and today we 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.210
 Visiting the owner of perhaps the most residential 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.210
 g2 at least Moscow 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.189
 hello kolya hello what can you say 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 about this really yours 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 cribs is so good yes it is so he 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.140
 arrived here from japan 2008 with 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.960
 29 thousand kilometers in full 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.750
 I am the second owner of the stock and found somewhere 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.430
 this miracle who bought it 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.420
 I found him in Likino-Dulevo on the most 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420
 extremely suburbs 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.640
 alexander former owner proper 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.710
 time is the first owner of this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.230
 car in Russia 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 when i came to elect the run was on 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 her from 45 thousand kilometers well, that is, he 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.700
 very little ride on it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.770
 I have no suspicions that the run is twisted 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.290
 I'm on arrival 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.120
 lifted on the lift firstly first 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.720
 what surprised me so much 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.460
 the purest bottom of the gift of dirt was not like 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.030
 that he was driving only weather 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.000
 on it I hid the valve cover pallet 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 crankcase 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.600
 really very motor condition 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.690
 good condition of all nodes could machines 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 It seems to me that the project is stylishly native 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.810
 do you feel responsible 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.840
 owning such a machine and even in such 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 able of course they are completely left 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.400
 a bit more so here in Russia 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 how many cars did you see before 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.619
 choose this one actually only 2 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.679
 This is the second one I've been looking for for a long time. 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.810
 I decided a long time ago that I 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.440
 I want some quick little typewriter 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.119
 but for a long time I could not decide what it is 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.420
 will be for the car in the end when 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.390
 had seen 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.030
 having bought the sides of the knees I realized that yes it is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.280
 she never started to go watch these 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.209
 own car 2 I immediately got 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.350
 This one, in principle, I do not think it took because 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.900
 that it was stupid to drive and look in 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.630
 better condition car because up 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.320
 so far I have not seen such 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.080
 major damage from this car no no 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.360
 it was well, except for one you can not 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.780
 principle to call a large pulley collapsed 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.840
 crankshaft own principle can 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.310
 say the disease of these machines gang 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.490
 rubber compound not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.530
 endured for so many years 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.090
 actually changed and rejoice 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.810
 did you make any cars 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.819
 improvements 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 either tuning yes basically they are all 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.240
 concern handling and own was 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.240
 not much of it 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.069
 racks and gastritis jointly small 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:14.670
 understatement and tires good hankuk k110 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.459
 slide can be called just about so 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.069
 there is no full stock so you still 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.160
 wanted to do with this machine i think that 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.790
 first of all it will be a replacement 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.769
 automatic machine for mechanics and installation more 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.690
 productive brakes of it i think yes 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.489
 I think about it because I'm afraid 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:42.560
 These drives me not to lease 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:46.069
 front calipers and asked therefore 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.390
 possible options but although of course not 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.930
 I would like it because it's the most 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.510
 such a 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.819
 was the tone of the decision can even be said 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.320
 lacquers from galant pinch can 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.260
 put the wheels from it to as an option 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:05.400
 do you love to blow it well 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.030
 Well, in principle, you who do not like really 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.819
 Actually, I am a wife often and therefore 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.860
 every day is a holiday yes that way and 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.709
 of course I want to travel on the road 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.450
 feel the full extent of these emotions but especially 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.389
 these places are not fond of because I feel sorry 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.980
 here I will put the machine gun mechanic bulk 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.669
 and brakes then you too 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.100
 the conversation that this car gave you 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.790
 first it is of course completely new 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.830
 emotions drive and secondly it is new 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.610
 meet interesting people 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.310
 driving on the same machines we 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.240
 constantly communicate constantly helping 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.890
 each other without mutual help or where 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.570
 my many say dsm 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:53.990
 no longer a cake well I would n't say that 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.690
 Of course, before the haircut, most are already 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:01.160
 sold their eclipse and got 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.740
 family but replaced by a new 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.200
 generation like us with you 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.050
 creating cleanly we spend together 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.240
 time 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.020
 together this summer together 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.670
 company in the river 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.890
 in the winter it can be all sorts of gatherings all 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:22.770
 go there of course come all 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.570
 newcomers urgently meet 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.320
 are you going to sell it in a year 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.840
 in five years there is no honest I 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.120
 just didn't even think about it on the throne in 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.220
 thoughts because 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.970
 simple and why she goes she 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.110
 problem-free to the extreme if necessary 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.690
 I will use just like 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.710
 most probably everyday 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:52.140
 hassle-free of all my machines is also not 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.340
 I see sense, thank you for your time 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.180
 Unfortunately we can not today 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.510
 ride 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.010
 but spirits next time it all melts 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.440
 we will definitely go for a drive 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:08.380
 surely still shoot let it be 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:10.300
 great video if you want to know about 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.620
 this machine more you can read 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.860
 his logbook on the drive 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.410
 the link will be in the description under the video and on 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:22.020
 this we all subscribe to today
