but<00:02:26.080> what<00:02:26.349> helps<00:02:26.799> me<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.129> is<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.580> did<00:02:27.790> in

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
but what helps me here is if it did in

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.030 
but what helps me here is if it did in
fact<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.659> did<00:02:28.840> not<00:02:29.019> have<00:02:29.230> hard<00:02:29.470> line<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.680> I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
fact if I did not have hard line on I

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.369 
fact if I did not have hard line on I
would<00:02:30.579> have<00:02:30.700> died<00:02:30.879> as<00:02:31.299> soon<00:02:31.540> as<00:02:31.780> soon<00:02:32.049> as<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.230> got

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
would have died as soon as soon as I got

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.500 
would have died as soon as soon as I got
the<00:02:32.500> knife<00:02:32.650> kill<00:02:32.890> I'd<00:02:33.099> died<00:02:33.280> right<00:02:33.549> after<00:02:33.730> man

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
way it heightens the footsteps and makes

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.720 
way it heightens the footsteps and makes
them<00:03:04.659> louder<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.230> enemies<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:06.190> for<00:03:06.430> enemies

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730

switched to my tack knife it would have

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.699 
switched to my tack knife it would have
been<00:03:28.450> smart<00:03:28.780> for<00:03:28.900> me<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.019> have<00:03:29.169> my<00:03:29.200> tack<00:03:29.500> knife

been smart for me to have my tack knife
out<00:03:29.889> but<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.639> didn't<00:03:31.419> use<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.599> because<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.379> was

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
out but I didn't use it because I was

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.559 
out but I didn't use it because I was
using<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.340> USR<00:03:33.790> right<00:03:34.060> now<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> got<00:03:34.419> the

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
using the USR right now I got the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.879 
using the USR right now I got the
ghillie<00:03:34.750> suit<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.139> if<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.379> don't<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.739> about

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
ghillie suit on if you don't know about

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.369 
ghillie suit on if you don't know about
my<00:03:36.069> arms<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:37.329> just<00:03:37.510> want<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.840> us<00:03:38.049> are<00:03:38.230> out

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
my arms and I just want that us are out

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.960 
my arms and I just want that us are out
there<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:38.769> now<00:03:38.919> in<00:03:39.069> most<00:03:39.220> use<00:03:39.459> weapon<00:03:39.849> I

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
there it's now in most use weapon I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.089 
there it's now in most use weapon I
switched<00:03:40.299> over<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:41.560> knife<00:03:41.739> because<00:03:42.010> I

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
switched over to the knife because I

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.009 
switched over to the knife because I
wanted<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.400> get<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.609> kick<00:03:42.790> combat<00:03:43.449> knife<00:03:43.629> off

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
wanted to get that kick combat knife off

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.539 
wanted to get that kick combat knife off
so<00:03:44.290> that's<00:03:44.440> kind<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.739> why<00:03:44.859> I'm<00:03:44.980> using<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
so that's kind of why I'm using this the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.180 
so that's kind of why I'm using this the
most<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.449> I<00:03:46.690> did<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:47.169> again<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.829> did<00:03:47.980> have

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
most if I did have again if I did have

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.680 
most if I did have again if I did have
that<00:03:48.310> secondary<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.940> would<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.389> used<00:03:49.540> that

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
that secondary I would have used that

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.240 
that secondary I would have used that
it's<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.019> lot<00:03:50.260> quicker<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.829> guys<00:03:50.949> don't

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
it's a lot quicker if you guys don't

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.819 
it's a lot quicker if you guys don't
know<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:52.389> like<00:03:53.049> tack<00:03:53.379> knifes

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
know that like tack knifes

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.530 
know that like tack knifes
they're<00:03:54.489> not<00:03:54.699> really<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:55.239> they<00:03:55.359> don't<00:03:55.510> have

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
they're not really like they don't have

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.180 
they're not really like they don't have
a<00:03:55.629> very<00:03:55.840> far<00:03:56.079> lunch<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.440> don't<00:03:56.560> lunge<00:03:56.829> with<00:03:57.010> it

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
a very far lunch you don't lunge with it

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.280 
a very far lunch you don't lunge with it
but<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.150> does<00:03:58.299> have<00:03:58.449> a<00:03:58.480> far<00:03:58.720> reach<00:03:58.959> because

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
but it does have a far reach because

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.460 
but it does have a far reach because
that<00:03:59.560> technically<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.250> lunch<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:02.049> that
