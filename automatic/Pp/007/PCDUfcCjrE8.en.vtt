00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
be strong and healthy they look better

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740 
be strong and healthy they look better
when<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.520> some<00:00:50.760> paint<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.149> starting<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
when I get some paint on it starting to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.709 
when I get some paint on it starting to
look<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> mess<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> boat<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.449> think

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
look like a mess of a boat and i think

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.790 
look like a mess of a boat and i think
that<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:56.390> PG&amp;E<00:00:57.390> power<00:00:57.870> stacks<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.469> there

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that the PG&amp;E power stacks over there

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.260 
that the PG&amp;E power stacks over there
all<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> boats<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
all the boats down here there's a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.349 
all the boats down here there's a
program<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.809> sign<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.770> paid

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
program you sign up for and you get paid

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.549 
program you sign up for and you get paid
the<00:01:03.359> idea<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.960> paid<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> clean<00:01:04.439> your

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the idea is you get paid to clean your

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.810 
the idea is you get paid to clean your
boat<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:04.949> don't<00:01:05.100> actually<00:01:05.369> come<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> check

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
boat they don't actually come and check

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.890 
boat they don't actually come and check
to<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> clean<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.630> belt<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
to see if you clean your belt and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.179 
to see if you clean your belt and
hopefully<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> apply<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> program

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
hopefully when you apply for the program

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.710 
hopefully when you apply for the program
don't<00:01:08.700> even<00:01:08.880> check<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.600> both

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
don't even check and see if you're both

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.219 
don't even check and see if you're both
