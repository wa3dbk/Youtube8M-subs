00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.839 
it as you can see in the background I
mostly<00:00:27.900> used<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> hide<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> c4<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> top

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

mostly used it to hide the c4 at the top
of<00:00:29.970> lips<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.019> could<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.439> down

of lips so that I could put down

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950
