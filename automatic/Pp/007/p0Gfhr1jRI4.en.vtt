00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
so if you've been having problems

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.620 
so if you've been having problems
replacing<00:00:10.530> starters<00:00:11.300> if<00:00:12.300> you've<00:00:12.480> been

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
replacing starters if you've been

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.900 
replacing starters if you've been
putting<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.049> one<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.160> two<00:00:14.250> starters<00:00:14.670> in

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
putting the one or two starters in

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.929 
putting the one or two starters in
within<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.299> year<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.680> some<00:00:16.830> other<00:00:16.920> issue

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.880 

maybe<00:00:20.480> when<00:00:20.689> your<00:00:20.869> cables<00:00:21.289> it's<00:00:21.439> not<00:00:21.589> good<00:00:21.859> so

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
maybe when your cables it's not good so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.259 
maybe when your cables it's not good so
you<00:00:22.189> want<00:00:22.310> to<00:00:22.369> do<00:00:22.460> what's<00:00:22.699> called<00:00:22.880> a<00:00:23.060> voltage

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
you want to do what's called a voltage

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.550 
you want to do what's called a voltage
drop<00:00:23.689> test

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
drop test

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.389 
drop test
let's<00:00:25.400> check<00:00:25.579> the<00:00:26.650> battery<00:00:27.650> positive<00:00:28.160> cable

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
let's check the battery positive cable

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.639 
let's check the battery positive cable
and<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.419> battery<00:00:29.720> negative<00:00:29.899> cable<00:00:30.410> going

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
and the battery negative cable going

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.580 
and the battery negative cable going
down<00:00:31.480> at<00:00:32.480> least<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.809> battery<00:00:33.019> positive<00:00:33.199> going

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
down at least the battery positive going

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.350 
down at least the battery positive going
to<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.769> starter<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.790> actually<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.120> ground

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
to the starter and actually the ground

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.770 
to the starter and actually the ground
ones<00:00:35.600> next<00:00:35.989> they're<00:00:36.199> on<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.070> back<00:00:37.220> side

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
ones next they're on the back side

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.200 
ones next they're on the back side
supply<00:00:38.780> big<00:00:39.170> black<00:00:39.379> where<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.820> check<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
supply big black where you check the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.389 
supply big black where you check the
battery<00:00:41.510> positive<00:00:42.140> cable<00:00:42.530> first<00:00:42.949> we<00:00:43.220> get<00:00:43.370> a

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
battery positive cable first we get a

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.049 
battery positive cable first we get a
connection<00:00:44.180> right<00:00:44.750> there<00:00:44.809> on<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.230> post

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
connection right there on the post

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.880 
connection right there on the post
that'll<00:00:47.059> go<00:00:47.180> up<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.479> the<00:00:47.570> battery<00:00:50.589> so<00:00:51.589> here<00:00:51.769> we

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
that'll go up to the battery so here we

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.000 
that'll go up to the battery so here we
are<00:00:51.920> at<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.309> battery<00:00:53.150> positive<00:00:53.739> we<00:00:54.739> have<00:00:54.860> our

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
are at the battery positive we have our

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.600 
are at the battery positive we have our
connection<00:00:55.549> there<00:00:55.729> they're<00:00:56.269> very<00:00:56.449> positive

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
connection there they're very positive

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.810 
connection there they're very positive
then<00:00:58.610> we<00:00:58.759> have<00:00:58.879> our<00:00:59.000> meter<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:01.580> we're<00:01:01.729> gonna

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
then we have our meter and we're gonna

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.010 
then we have our meter and we're gonna
be<00:01:01.970> looking<00:01:02.059> for<00:01:03.790> probably<00:01:04.790> point<00:01:05.239> 1<00:01:05.509> or<00:01:05.720> less

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
be looking for probably point 1 or less

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
be looking for probably point 1 or less
volts<00:01:06.500> that's<00:01:06.619> point<00:01:07.009> 1<00:01:07.400> or<00:01:07.909> less<00:01:08.950> when<00:01:09.950> we

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
volts that's point 1 or less when we

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.070 
volts that's point 1 or less when we
crank<00:01:10.340> it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.890 

we<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.230> want<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.470> disconnect<00:01:17.240> fuel<00:01:18.240> or

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
we also want to disconnect fuel or

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
we also want to disconnect fuel or
ignition<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.190> start

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
ignition for this so it doesn't start

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.430 
ignition for this so it doesn't start
I'm<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.690> ahead<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> provide

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
disconnect spark right here we're gonna
put<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.480> to<00:01:27.660> ground<00:01:28.730> somewhere<00:01:30.560> then<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
put this to ground somewhere then it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.870 
put this to ground somewhere then it
won't<00:01:31.770> start<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> we'll<00:01:32.400> hold<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> pedal

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
won't start and we'll hold the pedal

won't start and we'll hold the pedal
down<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.300> floor<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> keep<00:01:33.870> it<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.050> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
down to the floor to keep it in the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.310 
down to the floor to keep it in the
clear<00:01:34.380> flood<00:01:34.680> mode

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.720 

you<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.010> train<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.550> watch

so<00:02:08.369> move<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> negative<00:02:09.149> side<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
so move to the negative side here and

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.490 
so move to the negative side here and
then<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.500> our<00:02:11.420> connections<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:13.260> the

starting<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.659> felt<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.959> had<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.109> little<00:03:31.200> sturdy

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
starting we felt it had a little sturdy

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.869 
starting we felt it had a little sturdy
problem<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.859> customer<00:03:32.129> wasn't<00:03:32.280> complaining

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
problem the customer wasn't complaining

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.970 
problem the customer wasn't complaining
but<00:03:33.030> wasn't<00:03:33.810> starting<00:03:34.230> right<00:03:34.409> this<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.890> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but wasn't starting right this is the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.970 
but wasn't starting right this is the
battery<00:03:35.340> positive<00:03:35.519> connection<00:03:36.889> see<00:03:37.889> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
battery positive connection see the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.089 
battery positive connection see the
plastics<00:03:38.400> melting<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.150> interfering<00:03:40.099> it's

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
plastics melting and interfering it's

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.709 
plastics melting and interfering it's
interfering<00:03:41.639> with<00:03:41.790> actually<00:03:42.120> mounting<00:03:42.450> up<00:03:42.569> to

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:42.719 
interfering with actually mounting up to

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.509 
interfering with actually mounting up to
the<00:03:42.810> battery<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:43.469> you<00:03:43.560> can<00:03:43.709> see<00:03:43.889> almost<00:03:44.219> 50%

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the battery there you can see almost 50%

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.629 
the battery there you can see almost 50%
of<00:03:44.909> it<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.120> blocking<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.319> metal<00:03:46.639> from

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
of it is blocking the metal from

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.589 
of it is blocking the metal from
actually<00:03:48.379> connecting<00:03:49.379> so<00:03:50.299> you're<00:03:51.299> having<00:03:51.510> a

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
actually connecting so you're having a

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.110 
actually connecting so you're having a
starting<00:03:51.959> problem<00:03:52.700> been<00:03:53.700> going<00:03:53.970> through

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
starting problem been going through

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.179 
starting problem been going through
starters<00:03:54.720> or<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:55.319> doesn't<00:03:55.590> sound<00:03:55.799> right<00:03:56.040> and

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
starters or just doesn't sound right and

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.409 
starters or just doesn't sound right and
you<00:03:56.250> replace<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.669> starter<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.150> you're<00:03:57.269> still

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
you replace the starter and you're still

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.500 
you replace the starter and you're still
having<00:03:57.629> problems<00:03:58.639> of<00:03:59.639> course<00:03:59.909> if<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.209> replace

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
having problems of course if you replace

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.819 
having problems of course if you replace
the<00:04:00.659> battery<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.049> might<00:04:01.200> just<00:04:01.379> come<00:04:01.530> across

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
the battery you might just come across

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.800 
the battery you might just come across
this<00:04:02.129> but<00:04:02.400> gotta<00:04:02.879> have<00:04:03.030> good<00:04:03.209> connections<00:04:03.689> of

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
this but gotta have good connections of

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.190 
this but gotta have good connections of
the<00:04:03.840> battery<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.900> should<00:04:07.079> look<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.279 

so<00:04:13.200> we'll<00:04:13.319> clean<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.620> cell<00:04:13.829> up<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:15.109> fix<00:04:16.109> it

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
so we'll clean the cell up and fix it

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.189 
so we'll clean the cell up and fix it
make<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.590> all<00:04:16.799> shiny<00:04:16.829> new<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:20.930> was<00:04:21.930> doing<00:04:22.139> a

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
make it all shiny new I was doing a

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.760 
make it all shiny new I was doing a
voltage<00:04:22.620> test<00:04:23.009> on<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.820> had<00:04:24.770> thirteen

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
voltage test on this and I had thirteen

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.300 
voltage test on this and I had thirteen
point<00:04:26.010> five<00:04:26.220> eight<00:04:26.460> volts<00:04:26.669> here<00:04:28.190> when<00:04:29.190> I'm

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
point five eight volts here when I'm

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.460 
point five eight volts here when I'm
doing<00:04:29.520> my<00:04:29.580> test<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.570> at<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> alternator<00:04:31.320> in

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
doing my test but at the alternator in

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.409 
doing my test but at the alternator in
the<00:04:31.560> back<00:04:31.880> back<00:04:32.880> here

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
the back back here

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.740 
the back back here
I<00:04:33.650> had<00:04:34.650> fourteen<00:04:35.070> point<00:04:35.280> five<00:04:35.430> volts<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.570> this

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
I had fourteen point five volts so this

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.110 
I had fourteen point five volts so this
crappy<00:04:37.320> connection<00:04:37.889> here<00:04:38.010> was<00:04:38.130> costing<00:04:38.580> me<00:04:38.699> a

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
crappy connection here was costing me a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.689 
crappy connection here was costing me a
1<00:04:39.389> volt<00:04:39.599> so<00:04:42.289> that's<00:04:43.289> too<00:04:44.039> much<00:04:44.159> of<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.400> voltage

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
1 volt so that's too much of a voltage

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.270 
1 volt so that's too much of a voltage
drop<00:04:44.849> 1<00:04:45.150> volt<00:04:45.389> as<00:04:46.289> we<00:04:46.470> talked<00:04:46.680> about<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:47.130> should

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
drop 1 volt as we talked about it should

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
drop 1 volt as we talked about it should
be<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.400> point<00:04:48.289> one<00:04:49.759> actually<00:04:50.759> my<00:04:50.880> meter<00:04:51.090> was

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
be a point one actually my meter was

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.240 
be a point one actually my meter was
yeah<00:04:51.539> my<00:04:51.750> volt<00:04:51.960> meter<00:04:52.139> was<00:04:52.259> reading<00:04:52.500> two<00:04:52.740> volts

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
yeah my volt meter was reading two volts

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.980 
yeah my volt meter was reading two volts
I<00:04:53.430> think<00:04:53.789> it<00:04:54.060> was<00:04:54.150> at<00:04:54.300> twelve<00:04:54.539> point<00:04:54.810> five

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
I think it was at twelve point five

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.760 
I think it was at twelve point five
eight<00:04:55.259> volts<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> lost<00:04:55.979> two<00:04:56.130> volts<00:04:56.550> hmm

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
eight volts so I lost two volts hmm

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.650 
eight volts so I lost two volts hmm
can't<00:04:58.770> afford<00:04:58.860> two<00:04:59.190> volts

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.570
