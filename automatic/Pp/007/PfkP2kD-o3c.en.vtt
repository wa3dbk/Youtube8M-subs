 fps game born because inspired by the 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.050
 Standalone saga this game looks 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.030
 a real cod and therefore 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.490
 frankly, I don't know what to expect 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.310
 we only know that it will be released in the first 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.310
 mid 2015 and we'll see 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.790

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.040
 shows other cinematics that they don't 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.770
 other than to warn even more the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.740
 our hype of poor players who don't 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.270
 they do nothing but wait for its release 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.700
 in addition the video announces that who 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.070

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.770
 access a free final demo 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.430
 fantasy 15 which seems to last four 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.720
 hours 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.030
 in short, hype everyware everywhere 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.340
 I remind you that it is the release of time siro è 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.930
 set for March 2015 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.060
 among the news that they have succeeded in 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.760
 collect in this period there is one 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.190
 which attracted me particularly 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.410
 dedicated to the study ghibli the king of 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.290
 dreams hernanes is the title of the film 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.260
 documentary that will resume from within 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.750
 our studio ghibli showing us the 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.690
 many facets and introspections 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.880
 that maybe we never saw the movie 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.590
 of a full two hours and I must admit that 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.169
 I also particularly care 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.930
 because I had never seen a studio 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.760
 ghibli from that point of view in each 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.310

 to conclude our news corner e 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.780
 we find the top manga ranking 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.550
 of the story of shonen jump 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.620

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.250
 which is the complete ranking 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.169
 I can only anticipate that 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.320
 obviously we find in top dragon ball 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.920

 boys a historical classification that 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.630
