00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hello YouTube booted five here and today

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.550 
hello YouTube booted five here and today
I<00:00:02.879> know<00:00:03.030> have<00:00:03.449> another<00:00:03.570> thing<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> want<00:00:04.500> to

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
I know have another thing that I want to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.820 
I know have another thing that I want to
show<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:05.879> my<00:00:06.000> security<00:00:06.420> system

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
show you so this is my security system

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
show you so this is my security system
it<00:00:07.830> uses<00:00:07.980> doors<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.059> trap<00:00:09.300> doors<00:00:10.400> so<00:00:11.809> again

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it uses doors and trap doors so again

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.930 
it uses doors and trap doors so again
you<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.620> break<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> blocks<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.370> really

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
you can just break the blocks but really

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.740 
you can just break the blocks but really
that's<00:00:15.089> not<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> point

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
that's not the point

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
that's not the point
it's<00:00:16.350> just<00:00:16.560> kind<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.770> another<00:00:17.100> cool<00:00:17.340> concept

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
it's just kind of another cool concept

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510 
it's just kind of another cool concept
that<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.000> want<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> show<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:20.310> won't<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
that I want to show you and I won't be

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.980 
that I want to show you and I won't be
making<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> tutorial<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.630> because<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
making a tutorial for this because I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.300 
making a tutorial for this because I
already<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> tutorial<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.890> how<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> do

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
already have a tutorial on how to do

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.580 
already have a tutorial on how to do
everything<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.960> I'll<00:00:25.109> show<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.380> in

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
everything in it which I'll show you in

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.019 
everything in it which I'll show you in
a<00:00:25.619> bit<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.220> first<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.699> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> show<00:00:26.970> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
a bit but first I just want to show you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.660 
a bit but first I just want to show you
how<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.300> works<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> black<00:00:28.529> wool<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.400> our

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
how it works so the black wool is our

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.910 
how it works so the black wool is our
the<00:00:29.849> reset<00:00:30.150> buttons<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.080> left<00:00:31.320> side<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the reset buttons the left side is the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
the reset buttons the left side is the
combo<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.700> open<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> doors<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> right

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
combo to open the doors and the right

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
combo to open the doors and the right
side<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> combo<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.520> open<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> trapdoors

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
side is the combo to open the trapdoors

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.930 
side is the combo to open the trapdoors
so<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> combo<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:40.940> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so if you just put the combo in the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
so if you just put the combo in the
doors<00:00:42.120> open<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.530> put<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> combo<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
doors open and if we put the combo in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
doors open and if we put the combo in
for<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> trapdoors<00:00:44.910> cause<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.539> we're<00:00:45.660> going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
for the trapdoors cause if we're going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.959 
for the trapdoors cause if we're going
they<00:00:46.020> don't<00:00:46.230> open<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.949> trap<00:00:53.160> door<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.460> open<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
they don't open the trap door is open so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
they don't open the trap door is open so
then<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.140> down<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.350> Oh<00:00:57.710> what's<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
then we can go down here Oh what's this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.080 
then we can go down here Oh what's this
oh<00:01:01.640> no<00:01:02.640> TNT<00:01:03.149> oh<00:01:05.900> but<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> didn't<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.320> anything

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
oh no TNT oh but it didn't do anything

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.280 
oh no TNT oh but it didn't do anything
except<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.570> damage<00:01:09.810> me<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
except I think it would damage me if I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
except I think it would damage me if I
damage<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.299> reason<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.659> into

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
damage on but the reason it's into

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.300 
damage on but the reason it's into
anything<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.460> because<00:01:14.460> I've<00:01:14.909> water<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:15.420> here

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
anything is because I've water down here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.840 
anything is because I've water down here
sound<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.610> free<00:01:17.880> space

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.539 

and<00:01:21.850> I<00:01:22.630> can<00:01:22.869> just<00:01:23.049> put<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.380> TNT<00:01:23.799> like<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.189> and

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
and I can just put the TNT like this and

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.340 
and I can just put the TNT like this and
then<00:01:25.270> when<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.479> pressure<00:01:25.689> plates<00:01:25.990> activated

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.990 

it<00:01:29.350> doesn't<00:01:29.770> damage<00:01:29.979> anything<00:01:30.400> except<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
it doesn't damage anything except the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.210 
it doesn't damage anything except the
player<00:01:33.149> so<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.420> then<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.990> chess<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.590> have

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
player so and then in the chess I have

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.609 
player so and then in the chess I have
diamonds<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.790> spelling<00:01:37.060> my<00:01:37.270> name<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:38.470> is

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
diamonds so spelling my name which is

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:47.399 
diamonds so spelling my name which is
kind<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:38.890> cheesy<00:01:44.100> anyway<00:01:45.960> let<00:01:46.960> me<00:01:47.020> just<00:01:47.170> close

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
kind of cheesy anyway let me just close

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.020 
kind of cheesy anyway let me just close
these<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.680> don't<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.070> walk<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.460> crust<00:01:48.789> this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
these I don't and walk that crust this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.999 
these I don't and walk that crust this
and<00:01:50.100> sand<00:01:51.100> go<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.520> top<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.740> I'll<00:01:53.830> show<00:01:53.979> you

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
and sand go to the top so I'll show you

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.999 
and sand go to the top so I'll show you
the<00:01:54.159> Redstone<00:01:54.550> that<00:01:54.700> does<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:55.179> now<00:01:56.009> well

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
the Redstone that does this now well

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.770 
the Redstone that does this now well
first<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.429> all<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.569> did

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
first of all this this is the I just did

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.690 
first of all this this is the I just did
a<00:01:58.810> little<00:01:58.960> experiment<00:01:59.259> with<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.649> doors<00:01:59.860> this

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
a little experiment with the doors this

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.190 
a little experiment with the doors this
is<00:02:00.759> how<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.090> made<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.420> door<00:02:01.569> circuit<00:02:04.200> because

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
is how I made the door circuit because

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.219 
is how I made the door circuit because
these<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.490> be<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.000> off<00:02:07.080> for<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
these have to be on and off for the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.660 
these have to be on and off for the
doors<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.619> open<00:02:08.649> at<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.009> same<00:02:09.160> time<00:02:09.369> for<00:02:09.580> some

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
doors to open at the same time for some

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.800 
doors to open at the same time for some
reason<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.120> tutorial<00:02:13.600> on<00:02:13.660> this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
reason I think I have tutorial on this

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.420 
reason I think I have tutorial on this
I'm<00:02:13.989> not<00:02:14.080> sure<00:02:14.140> though<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:15.010> then<00:02:15.489> over<00:02:15.700> here

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I'm not sure though and then over here

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.890 
I'm not sure though and then over here
this<00:02:18.430> may<00:02:18.700> look<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:18.910> little<00:02:19.000> complicated<00:02:19.330> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
this may look a little complicated to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.960 
this may look a little complicated to
you<00:02:20.019> but<00:02:20.319> it's<00:02:20.440> actually<00:02:20.739> pretty<00:02:20.860> simple<00:02:21.190> this

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
you but it's actually pretty simple this

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.020 
you but it's actually pretty simple this
is<00:02:22.030> my<00:02:22.299> button<00:02:22.720> combination<00:02:23.410> tutorial<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.100> mean

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
is my button combination tutorial I mean

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.319 
is my button combination tutorial I mean
that<00:02:25.209> tutorial<00:02:25.690> um<00:02:26.610> button<00:02:27.610> combination<00:02:28.180> lock

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
that tutorial um button combination lock

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.979 
that tutorial um button combination lock
I<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.660> tutorial<00:02:28.989> on<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:31.269> it's

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
I have a tutorial on it so it's

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.020 
I have a tutorial on it so it's
basically<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:33.130> same<00:02:33.160> thing<00:02:33.549> repeated

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
basically just the same thing repeated

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.900 
basically just the same thing repeated
ours<00:02:34.690> no<00:02:35.019> Aris<00:02:35.440> no<00:02:35.620> artists<00:02:36.070> no<00:02:36.250> artists<00:02:36.700> nor

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
ours no Aris no artists no artists nor

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.410 
ours no Aris no artists no artists nor
and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:38.260> these<00:02:39.100> buttons<00:02:39.730> connect<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.239> them

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and then these buttons connect to them

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.569 
and then these buttons connect to them
and<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.459> reset<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.579> basically

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
and this is just a reset so basically

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.449 
and this is just a reset so basically
when<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.000> change<00:02:46.570> all<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> states<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.170> these

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
when you change all the states of these

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.800 
when you change all the states of these
it<00:02:48.459> activates<00:02:48.880> this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.530 

and<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.950> may<00:02:54.910> look<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.239> little<00:02:55.270> more

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and this may look a little more

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.330 
and this may look a little more
complicated<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.290> still<00:02:56.500> pretty<00:02:56.680> basic<00:02:56.950> I

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
complicated it's still pretty basic I

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.460 
complicated it's still pretty basic I
mean<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.060> goes<00:02:58.450> connects<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.290> trapdoor

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
mean this goes connects to that trapdoor

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.020 
mean this goes connects to that trapdoor
this<00:03:02.470> one<00:03:02.680> connects<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.160> side<00:03:03.520> I'll

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
this one connects to that side I'll

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.530 
this one connects to that side I'll
break<00:03:04.300> this<00:03:04.450> little<00:03:05.130> C<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.340> then<00:03:07.300> down<00:03:07.599> here<00:03:08.020> I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
break this little C and then down here I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.420 
break this little C and then down here I
guess<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:11.019> gonna<00:03:11.110> put<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:11.950> redstone

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
guess I just gonna put it like redstone

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.339 
guess I just gonna put it like redstone
right<00:03:12.610> here<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.860> anyway<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.840> one<00:03:17.080> goes<00:03:17.319> down

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
right here but anyway this one goes down

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.320 
right here but anyway this one goes down
there<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.310> connects<00:03:18.580> under<00:03:18.819> there<00:03:21.330> and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
there and it connects under there and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:30.090 
there and it connects under there and
over<00:03:22.780> here<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:25.480> connects<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.830> I'm

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
over here it connects like that so I'm

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.259 
over here it connects like that so I'm
gonna<00:03:30.190> put<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> block<00:03:30.700> here<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:32.549> if<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:34.000> looks

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
gonna put a block here so if that looks

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.759 
gonna put a block here so if that looks
a<00:03:34.299> little<00:03:34.390> complicated<00:03:34.750> I'll<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.380> going<00:03:35.680> over

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
a little complicated I'll be going over

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.710 
a little complicated I'll be going over
that<00:03:35.920> when<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.580> do<00:03:36.700> my<00:03:36.850> tutorial<00:03:37.450> on<00:03:37.569> how<00:03:37.690> to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
that when I do my tutorial on how to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.199 
that when I do my tutorial on how to
make<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.250> bridge<00:03:39.269> with<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.599> moving<00:03:40.930> bridge

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209
