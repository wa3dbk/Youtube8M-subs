going<00:04:51.539> on<00:04:51.630> in<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.840> storyline<00:04:52.289> I<00:04:52.500> really

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
going on in the storyline I really

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.350 
going on in the storyline I really
didn't<00:04:52.950> pay<00:04:52.979> much<00:04:53.220> attention<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.970> was<00:04:54.090> kind<00:04:54.270> of

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
didn't pay much attention it was kind of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.580 
didn't pay much attention it was kind of
bleak<00:04:54.510> some<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.139> areas<00:04:55.410> seemed

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
bleak some of the areas seemed

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.200 
bleak some of the areas seemed
inconsistent<00:04:55.979> but<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.460> camera<00:04:56.729> angles<00:04:57.090> and

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
inconsistent but the camera angles and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.790 
inconsistent but the camera angles and
some<00:04:57.419> scenes<00:04:57.750> played<00:04:58.020> very<00:04:58.260> well<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.590> give<00:04:58.740> it

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
some scenes played very well to give it

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.589 
some scenes played very well to give it
a<00:04:58.860> realistic<00:04:59.190> feel<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.090> also<00:05:00.240> makes<00:05:00.510> the

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
a realistic feel and it also makes the

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:08.740 
a realistic feel and it also makes the
scenes<00:05:00.870> look<00:05:01.080> really<00:05:01.530> amazing

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.060
