 hello friends of cinex that many 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.520
 thank you for being here I am abrupt and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.259
 before starting with the box office of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.809
 This week I want to comment that 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.700
 have released the image of Lex Luther is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.769
 say the new lex luthor jesse 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
 eisenberg although the image as such does not 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.670
 it says a lot how interesting are the fans 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 arts that have been derived from this the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 I really hope he is a little inspired 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.539
 or at least approach the design 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.740
 to what we will see on the big screen 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 we will have to wait for it to be released 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.300
 batman I saw superman to see if our 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
 wishes come true and do not forget 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 to follow the facebook page of without 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 excess to be aware of this type 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.370
 of news as quickly as possible and as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 we were already waiting for the insurgent tape to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.969
 despite having placed the week 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 passed in the number one position of a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.260
 very big down since from 1 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 Third he went to this already 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 we were waiting since we know that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809
 fans go immediately to see the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 movie and that's why they get stuck 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.920
 rooms are completely full and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.690
 they manage to sneak into the position number 1 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.789
 we will have to wait for the next 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 week to see how far it falls in the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.239
 second site we have the comedy get 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 heart starring will ferrell and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.210
 keven heart is this type of comedies 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 that is not for everyone because 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.940
 any 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
 it may seem like a very silly humor 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 story is about a pretty boy 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 starring Will Ferrell that by 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.490
 a problem has to go to jail and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.620
 look for who trains him how about you 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.000
 they crave the truth to me not much and 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.950
 at number one site dreamworks 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.380
 surprises with its animation called home 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.120
 the truth I am very very surprised of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.190
 that this animation has reached the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.020
 ranked number one although the criticisms do not 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.970
 they treated her very well the people are 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.040
 liking a lot and that's what really 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.720
 matters both at the box office and in the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.640
 industry what do you think are you 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.550
 down before I leave I want to share 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.610
 the new trailer for the 007 tape 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.470
 Specter starring Daniel Craig 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.390
 although I feel that all the action 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.190
 they are saving for later 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.290
 is a good preparation or what do you think
