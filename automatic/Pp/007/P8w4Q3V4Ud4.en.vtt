- Hi, this is Jason with Revant Optics.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.405
Today I'm going to show you how
to remove and install lenses

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.008
in your Oakley Sliver F frame,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.410
this should work for the
Oakley Sliver as well.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
The F is the foldable
version here but both frames

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.288
utilize the same lens shape.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.544
(thundering and sword hitting steel)

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.295
These are the Oakley Sliver F frames.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.831
It's a newer frame for
Oakley and it has these

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:33.633
folding hinges there and
they get very compact

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.736
and you can fold them up nicely.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.738
There's also a version that does not have

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.741
the foldable hinges on the temples

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.876
and that's called the Sliver.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.478
To remove the lenses in this frame,

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:46.680
you're going to start by
pulling up on this edge

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.349
and pulling down on this edge

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:50.417
and then pushing on the
back side of the lens

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.652
with your fingers just like that,

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.520
pop right out.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.122
You may hear a popping noise.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:55.822
That's fine.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:59.226
That just means the lens is
coming out of the groove.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.827
And then to install your new lenses,

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.897
you'll take the nose edge
first and hold it in there

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.133
with your thumb, place it in the groove,

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.503
and then use your thumb
on the edge like that

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.171
just to push it in, and again you'll hear

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.039
a snapping or popping noise.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.976
That just means it's snapping into place.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.512
That is how you remove and install lenses

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:21.056
in your Oakley Sliver F frames.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.684
To ensure you're getting the most out of

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.153
your experience outside
we recommend replacing

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:28.555
your lenses if you have
any damage whatsoever,

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.831
scratches, abrasions, cracks.

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.293
You can also customize the
look of your sunglasses

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.929
or pick up different tints for
different lighting conditions

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.265
at revantoptics.com.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.499
Once you've replaced your lenses,

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.401
we'd love to see a picture of them,

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.339
so go ahead and post them to
Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:46.139
at #revantoptics.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.775
If you have any questions about
installation, your frames,

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.311
or anything in general, feel
free to shoot us an email

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.380
at support@revantoptics.com

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.949
and we'd be happy to help you out.
