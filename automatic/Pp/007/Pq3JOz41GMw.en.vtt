00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.350 
of direction known to man and I would
actually<00:01:20.039> find<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.640> useful<00:01:21.179> it's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
actually find this very useful it's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually find this very useful it's
quite<00:01:21.630> clear<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.289> think<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.679> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
quite clear I mean you think that you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
quite clear I mean you think that you
can't<00:01:23.039> see<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.429> on<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> small<00:01:23.940> screen<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
can't see a lot on a small screen but

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.790 
can't see a lot on a small screen but
it's<00:01:24.509> amazing<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:25.080> much<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.560> even

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
it's amazing how much you can I even

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's amazing how much you can I even
managed<00:01:26.039> to<00:01:26.069> browse<00:01:26.910> from<00:01:27.209> where<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.539> here

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
managed to browse from where we are here

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
managed to browse from where we are here
in<00:01:27.899> hoping<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.349> North<00:01:28.800> London<00:01:29.160> using<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:29.550> map

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
in hoping to North London using the map

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.430 
in hoping to North London using the map
takes<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.630> while<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.080> map<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
takes a little while for the map to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.160 
takes a little while for the map to
update<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> gets<00:01:32.789> there<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.959> nice

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
update but it gets there and it's nice

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.100 
update but it gets there and it's nice
and<00:01:34.349> clear<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> system<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> lifetime

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and clear the system is a lifetime

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600 
and clear the system is a lifetime
system<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> idea<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:38.069> that<00:01:38.190> once<00:01:38.369> you've

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
system so the idea is that once you've

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.279 
system so the idea is that once you've
bought<00:01:38.849> into<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.599> shouldn't<00:01:39.899> have<00:01:40.080> to

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
bought into it you shouldn't have to

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.080 
bought into it you shouldn't have to
replace<00:01:40.679> it<00:01:40.739> unless<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.250> change<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.880> phone

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
replace it unless you change your phone

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.960 
replace it unless you change your phone
to<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.599> requires<00:01:42.959> a<00:01:43.110> software<00:01:43.590> upgrade

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
to one that requires a software upgrade

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.050
