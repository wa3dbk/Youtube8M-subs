00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
what you're gonna be doing is just

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.979

now<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> imagine<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.860> multiplayer<00:02:27.340> would<00:02:27.519> be<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
now I imagine the multiplayer would be a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.339 
now I imagine the multiplayer would be a
little<00:02:28.000> better<00:02:28.180> due<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.840> human

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.680 
little better due to the human
competition<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.340> think<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.330> would<00:02:31.420> still

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690
