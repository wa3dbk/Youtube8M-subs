00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
possible I think one of the faction

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.199 
possible I think one of the faction
members<00:02:44.140> betrayed<00:02:44.829> them<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.280> blew<00:02:45.670> up<00:02:45.819> their

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
business when we looked up and we saw

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.140 
business when we looked up and we saw
names<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:56.319> appeared<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.829> be<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:57.190> our<00:02:57.220> roof<00:02:57.610> we

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
went back to our main chest room and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.340 
went back to our main chest room and
they<00:03:00.190> were<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.640> now<00:03:01.329> we<00:03:01.389> don't<00:03:01.780> really<00:03:02.109> know

our chest room what we believe happened

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.750 
our chest room what we believe happened
was<00:03:08.019> that<00:03:08.049> they<00:03:08.380> got<00:03:08.620> into<00:03:08.739> our<00:03:08.950> roof<00:03:09.220> then

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
was that they got into our roof then

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.550 
was that they got into our roof then
they<00:03:09.910> must<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.239> glitched<00:03:10.420> or<00:03:10.989> hacked<00:03:11.260> we

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
they must have glitched or hacked we

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 
they must have glitched or hacked we
don't<00:03:11.739> know<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.819> get<00:03:12.970> through<00:03:13.359> down

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
don't know but to get through down

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.440 
don't know but to get through down
through<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.380> lava<00:03:14.560> into<00:03:15.130> our<00:03:15.220> chest<00:03:15.519> room<00:03:15.790> now

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
through the lava into our chest room now

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.410 
through the lava into our chest room now
we<00:03:16.510> clearly<00:03:17.290> weren't<00:03:17.760> equipped<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:19.120> fight

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
we clearly weren't equipped to fight

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.990 
we clearly weren't equipped to fight
them<00:03:19.630> in<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.810> 2v2<00:03:20.230> bow<00:03:20.650> however<00:03:21.430> what<00:03:21.639> we<00:03:21.670> could

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
them in a 2v2 bow however what we could

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.360 
them in a 2v2 bow however what we could
do<00:03:22.180> was<00:03:22.389> block<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> exits<00:03:23.380> up<00:03:23.530> they<00:03:23.920> could<00:03:24.190> not

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
do was block the exits up they could not

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.339 
do was block the exits up they could not
get<00:03:24.549> out<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:25.269> couldn't<00:03:25.510> teleport<00:03:25.720> out<00:03:26.079> either

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
get out we couldn't teleport out either

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.069 
get out we couldn't teleport out either
and<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:26.950> could<00:03:27.099> slowly<00:03:27.459> punch<00:03:28.329> them<00:03:28.630> getting

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
and we could slowly punch them getting

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.710 
and we could slowly punch them getting
their<00:03:29.200> armor<00:03:29.709> eventually<00:03:30.519> down<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.690> we

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
their armor eventually down and if we

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.199 
their armor eventually down and if we
did<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.019> long<00:03:32.470> enough<00:03:32.739> we<00:03:33.099> could<00:03:33.489> actually

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
did that long enough we could actually

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.960 
did that long enough we could actually
get<00:03:34.900> one<00:03:35.200> low<00:03:35.560> enough<00:03:35.859> so<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.459> could<00:03:36.609> kill<00:03:36.819> them

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
get one low enough so we could kill them

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.870 
get one low enough so we could kill them
and<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.599> exactly<00:03:37.780> what<00:03:38.260> we<00:03:38.440> did<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.609> guy

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
and that is exactly what we did that guy

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.259 
and that is exactly what we did that guy
over<00:03:40.090> there<00:03:40.180> MC<00:03:40.959> he<00:03:41.440> was<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.769> victim<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.459> we

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
over there MC he was the victim and we

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.720 
over there MC he was the victim and we
eventually<00:03:43.510> punched<00:03:44.200> him<00:03:44.380> until<00:03:44.829> he<00:03:45.069> exploded

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
eventually punched him until he exploded

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.930 
eventually punched him until he exploded
into<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.329> pile<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.139> loot<00:03:47.700> obviously<00:03:48.700> we<00:03:48.819> got

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
into a pile of loot obviously we got

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.390 
into a pile of loot obviously we got
some<00:03:49.120> diamond<00:03:49.480> armor<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.739> bunch<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.069> golden
