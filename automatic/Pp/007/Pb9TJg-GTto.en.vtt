00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 there we are again at kopp tv I want 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.000
 just a little bit show pvm that 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.250
 I have you all the last few 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.230
 I have not shown myself so much 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 a bit of what pvm it may now too 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.980
 worried and just wants to show it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.550
 first the dragon carved with six 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.520
 claw 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.609
 well that's not all that good then 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 we have the more I never say again 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.050
 yes , we also hewn into the sea 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.099
 Of course it works well 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.260
 still a bit lucky with these 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 four hours that somehow stirs up then 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.969
 I'm always short for Wasserburg 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.340
 Run up there right up to it 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.059
 Of course, that's a bit 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 stupid but good 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.430
 yes, but do a little more 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.260
 hurt I have new claws now 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.820
 have pretty nice bonuses and that's why 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.510
 I'm happy here all the time 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.920
 present 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.539
 then I was not aware of it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 more like here any called in 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.330
 youtube was that in any case he too 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.430
 I would like to have one that does not have on everyone 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 case then burned i would someday 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.770
 use the walkway afterwards so I 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.330
 believe that you always see that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 again in the pvp videos i do 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 just completely in on I pull in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.689
 clothes on and then skin first popo 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.729
 purely because that's just a lot more 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.189
 bring that is 2 to 3 like the one 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.369
 Get more and then you do it 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.229
 yes, that does not hurt anymore 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.560
 that in any case a tip you the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.509
 you have useful karner and yes it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.869
 modest I think I show 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.869
 you would be a bit too beer without 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.950
 the half moon ring because many opinion 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.420
 we were in for the opaque 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.909
 alpenrhein we just have in the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.619
 moment bock on it a bit what pvm 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.979
 because pvp a bit 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.939
 boring with all the pusch inside 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.750
 is the front of his crowd ever 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 I do not give a shit 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.040
 yes here's the starting from my new kallen 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.780
 I'm really proud of it because of me 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.890
 do not know if there are better with so far 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.890
 the higher dss and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.140
 That worked well in the end 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.180
 had before those with 43 now but 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 I have to claw we have to say 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.130
 now a lot more on the g but to 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.340
 is synonymous that there just ttp find 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.620
 I'm extremely important in the pv just with 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.840
 the bossen there must be so on 30 km 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.260
 come 30 31 degrees and you stand there right 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.640
 Well 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.210
 everything under it is a bit shitty 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.800
 then we have a bit 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.880
 drop shadow tried what is so 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.610
 with the local and of course must be 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.790
 synonymous times look something like that with the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.260
 craft then goes my ruby is still 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.240
 not quite finished with the rest I come 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.790
 quite clearly but so 3300 attack worth 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.230
 had to be reached first 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.810
 that will now increase as a result 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.610
 just for myself at the 85 am and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.980
 Of course there is a lot and me 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.970
 I look forward to seeing you again until then 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.450
 take care 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.450
 bye
