in the middle of the deck and it's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.729 
in the middle of the deck and it's
completely<00:00:38.190> lost<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:40.190> all<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> do

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
completely lost in here all I have to do

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
completely lost in here all I have to do
stand<00:00:43.739> out<00:00:43.920> again<00:00:45.890> take<00:00:46.890> their<00:00:47.070> finger<00:00:47.449> try<00:00:48.449> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
stand out again take their finger try to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.069 
stand out again take their finger try to
feel<00:00:48.749> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:48.870> pulse<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:50.100> work<00:00:50.309> gets<00:00:51.079> faster

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
feel a little pulse the work gets faster

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
feel a little pulse the work gets faster
and<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.589> how<00:00:52.769> I<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.159> their<00:00:53.309> card<00:00:53.519> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

the card they say yes that's my card and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
the card they say yes that's my card and

the trick is over and they are amazed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
the trick is over and they are amazed
here's<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> tutorial<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.670> trick<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
here's the tutorial for this trick it is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
here's the tutorial for this trick it is
extremely<00:01:10.049> easy<00:01:10.079> and<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.759> only<00:01:11.969> thing<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
extremely easy and the only thing you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.899 
extremely easy and the only thing you
have<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.930> memorize<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.310> bottom<00:01:14.640> card
