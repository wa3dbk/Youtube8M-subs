Ford Explorer with a 4.6 v8 what we got

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.180 
Ford Explorer with a 4.6 v8 what we got
is<00:00:08.420> misfire<00:00:09.769> cold<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:11.210> cylinder<00:00:12.210> number<00:00:12.509> five

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
is misfire cold on cylinder number five

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
is misfire cold on cylinder number five
and<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.519> checked<00:00:14.790> mode<00:00:15.480> six<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.139> sure<00:00:16.350> enough

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
and we checked mode six and sure enough

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.260 
and we checked mode six and sure enough
now<00:00:16.890> only<00:00:17.130> number<00:00:17.490> five<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.940> showing

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
now only number five was showing

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.950 
now only number five was showing
misfires<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.180> did

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
misfires and what we got here is we did

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.939 
misfires and what we got here is we did
here<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.350> got<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.740> ho<00:00:23.670> amp<00:00:23.880> probe<00:00:24.740> around<00:00:25.740> the

here<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.549> we'll<00:01:05.700> start<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.150> thing<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
here and we'll start this thing and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:20.030 
here and we'll start this thing and
we'll<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.010> what<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> get

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760 

and<00:01:20.550> we<00:01:20.790> could<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.150> right<00:01:21.330> away<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:22.170> our

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and we could see right away here our

and we could see right away here our
current<00:01:23.160> ramp<00:01:23.370> on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.730> coil<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.300> good<00:01:25.010> what<00:01:26.010> we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
current ramp on the coil is good what we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
current ramp on the coil is good what we
got<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.520> though<00:01:26.730> is<00:01:26.910> we've<00:01:27.120> definitely<00:01:27.450> got

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
got here though is we've definitely got

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.040 
got here though is we've definitely got
a<00:01:27.840> problem<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.370> burn<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.810> our

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
a problem with the burn time on our

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.200 
a problem with the burn time on our
number<00:01:31.320> five<00:01:31.560> cylinder<00:01:32.190> we'll<00:01:32.610> switch<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
number five cylinder we'll switch that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
number five cylinder we'll switch that
over<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.810> once<00:01:34.050> we'll<00:01:34.980> switch<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
over here once we'll switch it to the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.520 
over here once we'll switch it to the
number<00:01:36.110> six<00:01:37.110> cylinder

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.969 

I<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.830> get<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.310> there

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.139 

there<00:01:46.880> we<00:01:47.000> see<00:01:47.180> number<00:01:47.509> six<00:01:48.310> we<00:01:49.310> got<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.549> good

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
there we see number six we got a good

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.980 
there we see number six we got a good
current<00:01:50.509> ramp

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
current ramp

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.260 
current ramp
we<00:01:51.289> got<00:01:51.439> good<00:01:51.649> voltage<00:01:52.100> drop<00:01:52.430> here<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.850> power

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
we got good voltage drop here to power

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.600 
we got good voltage drop here to power
up<00:01:53.479> or<00:01:53.659> coil<00:01:53.869> we've<00:01:54.740> got<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.890> great<00:01:55.100> end<00:01:55.310> up<00:01:55.429> to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
up or coil we've got a great end up to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.910 
up or coil we've got a great end up to
kick<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.179> we<00:01:56.420> got<00:01:56.570> fairly<00:01:57.020> decent<00:01:57.409> burn<00:01:57.619> time

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
kick and we got fairly decent burn time

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.039 
kick and we got fairly decent burn time
burn<00:01:58.909> times<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.329> little<00:01:59.420> short

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
burn times a little short

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.410 
burn times a little short
I<00:02:00.200> think<00:02:01.070> our<00:02:01.250> plugs<00:02:01.850> are<00:02:02.030> getting<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.299> little

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
I think our plugs are getting a little

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.139 
I think our plugs are getting a little
old<00:02:02.720> here<00:02:03.250> we'll<00:02:04.250> put<00:02:04.429> this<00:02:04.610> back<00:02:04.850> on<00:02:05.119> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
old here we'll put this back on the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.780 
old here we'll put this back on the
other<00:02:05.420> coil

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.070 

and<00:02:10.790> we'll<00:02:11.630> stop<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.940> right<00:02:13.940> here<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.780> here

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and we'll stop this right here this here

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.070 
and we'll stop this right here this here
from<00:02:15.470> here<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> considered<00:02:17.840> burn

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
from here to here is a considered burn

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.460 
from here to here is a considered burn
time<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.880> spark<00:02:20.210> plug<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:21.020> should<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.440> a

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
time of the spark plug we should have a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.670 
time of the spark plug we should have a
nice<00:02:21.710> even<00:02:22.240> come<00:02:23.240> down<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.780> go<00:02:23.960> across

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
nice even come down like that go across

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.960 
nice even come down like that go across
and<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:25.640> down<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.840> we've<00:02:27.050> got<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.970> definite

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
and then down so we've got a definite

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.150 
and then down so we've got a definite
problem<00:02:29.210> either<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> secondary<00:02:30.650> side<00:02:30.770> of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
problem either on the secondary side of

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.050 
problem either on the secondary side of
the<00:02:31.250> coil

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.360 

or<00:02:35.060> we've<00:02:35.960> got<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> problem<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.860> spark<00:02:37.130> plug

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
or we've got a problem in the spark plug

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.070 
or we've got a problem in the spark plug
boot<00:02:37.610> or<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.900> spark<00:02:39.620> plug<00:02:39.680> itself<00:02:41.080> we

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
boot or in this spark plug itself we

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.810 
boot or in this spark plug itself we
don't<00:02:42.230> have<00:02:42.380> any<00:02:42.560> lean<00:02:42.770> or<00:02:42.980> rich<00:02:43.220> codes<00:02:43.550> or

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
don't have any lean or rich codes or

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.240 
don't have any lean or rich codes or
anything<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.510> going<00:02:44.960> on<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:46.070> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
anything like that going on just a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.390 
anything like that going on just a
misfire<00:02:46.730> code<00:02:47.060> on<00:02:47.300> number<00:02:47.690> five<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.400> tomorrow

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
misfire code on number five so tomorrow

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.660 
misfire code on number five so tomorrow
morning<00:02:49.730> I'll<00:02:49.880> get<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> new<00:02:50.600> coil<00:02:51.340> put<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.520> in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
morning I'll get a new coil put that in

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.400 
morning I'll get a new coil put that in
there<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.060> let's<00:02:53.600> see<00:02:53.660> if<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:53.870> can<00:02:54.050> fix<00:02:54.230> this

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
there and let's see if we can fix this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.920 
there and let's see if we can fix this
problem<00:02:54.500> look<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.700> guess<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.270> about<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.660> there

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
problem look I guess it's about it there

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.830 
problem look I guess it's about it there
really<00:02:56.960> isn't<00:02:57.380> much<00:02:57.560> haven't<00:02:58.010> had<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.690> Ford<00:02:59.690> in

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
really isn't much haven't had a Ford in

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.390 
really isn't much haven't had a Ford in
a<00:02:59.900> while<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.920> one's<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.310> little

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
a while and this one's a little

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.210 
a while and this one's a little
different<00:03:01.520> being<00:03:02.120> an<00:03:02.270> explorer<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:04.040> eight

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
different being an explorer of the eight

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.060 
different being an explorer of the eight
four<00:03:04.580> six<00:03:05.290> explorer<00:03:06.290> within<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.800> part

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
four six explorer within this part

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.750 
four six explorer within this part

Vanetta

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.240 
Vanetta
Ford<00:03:08.270> with<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> misfire<00:03:08.990> in<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.440> little<00:03:09.740> while<00:03:09.920> so

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
Ford with a misfire in a little while so

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250 
Ford with a misfire in a little while so
I<00:03:10.460> thought<00:03:10.910> it'd<00:03:11.360> kind<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.630> refresh<00:03:11.990> myself

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
I thought it'd kind of refresh myself

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.050 
I thought it'd kind of refresh myself
here<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.540> verifying<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.470> do<00:03:15.590> have<00:03:15.740> a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
here and verifying that you do have a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.110 
here and verifying that you do have a
spark<00:03:17.060> problem<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.580> we<00:03:19.580> can<00:03:19.730> see<00:03:19.910> right<00:03:20.090> here

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
spark problem and we can see right here

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.530 
spark problem and we can see right here
are<00:03:20.480> our<00:03:20.870> burn<00:03:21.110> time<00:03:21.410> isn't<00:03:21.620> right<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.610> could

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
are our burn time isn't right so I could

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.660 
are our burn time isn't right so I could
just<00:03:23.930> swap<00:03:24.140> out<00:03:24.410> coils<00:03:24.860> here<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.190> see<00:03:25.340> if<00:03:25.430> our

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
just swap out coils here and see if our

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.720 
just swap out coils here and see if our
problem<00:03:26.150> moves<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.860> next<00:03:28.010> cylinder<00:03:28.520> down

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
problem moves to the next cylinder down

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.510 
problem moves to the next cylinder down
but<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.709> think<00:03:30.709> I'll<00:03:30.770> just<00:03:30.890> wait<00:03:31.010> till<00:03:31.370> tomorrow

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
but I think I'll just wait till tomorrow

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.230 
but I think I'll just wait till tomorrow
morning<00:03:31.760> now<00:03:32.030> I'll<00:03:32.150> get<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> new<00:03:34.970> coil

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
morning now I'll get a get a new coil

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.110 
morning now I'll get a get a new coil
and<00:03:35.510> we'll<00:03:36.110> see<00:03:36.320> what<00:03:36.470> happens<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:37.120> pretty

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
and we'll see what happens but pretty

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.600 
and we'll see what happens but pretty
confident<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.930> either<00:03:39.800> our<00:03:40.100> spark<00:03:40.430> is

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
confident that either our spark is

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.810 
confident that either our spark is
jumping<00:03:41.000> through<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.270> side<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.780> boot<00:03:41.959> or

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
jumping through the side of the boot or

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.190 
jumping through the side of the boot or
or<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:44.000> secondary<00:03:44.480> side<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.840> coil<00:03:45.170> is

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
or the secondary side of the coil is

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.770 
or the secondary side of the coil is
just<00:03:45.440> breaking<00:03:45.770> down<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.700> hey<00:03:47.480> it's<00:03:47.630> it's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
just breaking down so hey it's it's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.140 
just breaking down so hey it's it's
about<00:03:47.990> it
