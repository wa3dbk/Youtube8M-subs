right<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.640> confusing<00:01:18.290> against<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
right because it's confusing against the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.859 
right because it's confusing against the
grain<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.820> wolf<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
grain when you're not wolf and with the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
grain when you're not wolf and with the
grain<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.619> wolf<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> reason<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
grain when you are wolf the reason I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
grain when you are wolf the reason I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
said it's because when you go with the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.100 
said it's because when you go with the
grain<00:01:25.820> you're<00:01:26.820> saving<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.390> progress<00:01:27.869> when

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
grain you're saving your progress when

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
grain you're saving your progress when
you<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.320> against<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> grain<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.340> wolf

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
connections you're going you might mess

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010
