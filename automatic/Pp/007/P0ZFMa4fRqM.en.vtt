00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 good I was I'm going to be 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.100
 reviewing the changes that you have made 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.839
 to the final game after the beta of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 battlefield 4 it must be said that these 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.809
 changes have come pretty fast just 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.969
 a day after the beta quite 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.349
 fast the truth let's see them not only 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.820
 as cannes but as a review of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 brochures that the beta had but good at 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 I generally like the changes but there are 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.070
 a couple of them who have a crime like that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.660
 let's go to it the first changes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.830
 what we will see will be the performance and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 the first is the one we all suffer 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.760
 during the first days until two 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.019
 patches the lowering of gps and expenses 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.730
 constants which are being 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.650
 trying to improve even more than with the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.329
 patches that the truth yes for a lot 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.610
 people were magic so continued if 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 you give second the game asked for a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.260
 totally excessive performance respect 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.210
 to the processors motive among others of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.430
 that I could not do my streams 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020
 apart from that a failure that brought us 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 head was blocking on the screen of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 charge the constant classes it seems that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.750
 this will no longer happen in the final game 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.370
 although we already imagined that regarding 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 the specific changes that we will see for 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.699
 each platform in pcs has corrected a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 failure that made combinations of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 keys to bend over and stand 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.289
 confused and for the consoles something 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 that was asked very much was the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.199
 control settings 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.610
 battlefield 3 and well this is the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.790
 congratulations because he will be in battlefield 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.800
 4 but have 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.090
 there are many new functions in weapons 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.040
 such as the ability to 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.020
 combine the sights what will require 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.360
 additional spaces that will give the command 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.970
 of xbox one and of psoe 4 with which the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.860
 problem while reduced is not going to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.060
 be completely arranged in addition to this 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.560
 change a problem that the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.480
 console players who will find me 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.100
 no server this will be corrected 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.410
 through new location filters 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.640
 and the quick start option but not 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.650
 all the performance have also been 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.510
 corrected many playable aspects let's 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.280
 to say the most important first 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.780
 place the kills colosista little problem 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 to be eliminated the problem was that the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.290
 sound and the effect on the screen 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.820
 when he gives you a bullet they were very long and 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.009
 by the time the second one arrived, you died 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.750
 hence the istac and in addition it has 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.160
 adjusted both the compensator and the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.200
 suppressor of flash so that they return to 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.940
 fulfill the role of bat filters but 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.650
 also with its disadvantages that are the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.509
 gradual loss of precision in a weapon 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.920
 automatic getting said that if not 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.570
 you handle the recoil well and you like them 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.070
 the weapons to bursts are of luck not 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.619
 they are going to remove precision is going to be 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.360
 interesting a small update 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.340
 also that I forgot to indicate and that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.930
 a lot of people wonder is how they worked 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.820
 small ammunition and life packs 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.250
 basically what they are is part of 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.640
 ammunition or portable life the spears and 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.040
 they stick to a partner 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.630
 and recharges life or ammunition a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340
 little change that they have suffered is that 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.930
 now they will go further and they will stick 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.910
 truth in the goal when you throw it you're going to 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.310
 sometimes he came to the other player but he was 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.900
 it fell to the side has also specified in 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.280
 the difference between these and the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.850
 first aid kits and in ammunition boxes 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.380
 normal laptops will recharge two 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.790
 loaders for example and can be used 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.860
 in motion and those of all life 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.450
 will reload 4 but obviously we will have 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.100
 to wait until replacement 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.870
 interesting change in such an aspect 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.780
 important of team play apart from 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.060
 this a quite successful change is that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.320
 now the revive symbol will remain 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.480
 one third more time on the screen 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.739
 before they were seven seconds and now it's going to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.030
 be day which I think is a 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.290
 decision since there were many 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.910
 occasions when he went for a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.489
 partner of the missing symbol just 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.440
 when I was going to arrive relative to the pepos 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.840
 and rpg on the pepos will now have a 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.760
 great flash to see them well and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.410
 neither in the rpt nor is he a magician now they will set 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.330
 objectives something that I like very much put 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.160
 that a single engineer and a record 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.200
 could charge all the opposing team 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.330
 with the greatest ease in fact when 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.280
 you're fixed with by a rpg there was another 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.570
 very which made the beep not sound 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.890
 of fixation is to say that it was 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.569
 practically inevitable that I gave you 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.790
 part 2 acronyms have seen a change in their 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.770
 damage to him from 25% to 35 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.870
 making them go from 4 shots to 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.100
 lower it to 3 what I think is right 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.750
 because I did not like the method of 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.580
 battlefield 3 that was two acronyms and out 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.709
 and I do not like to spend all my 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.080
 rockets without any margin of error in a 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.209
 just him and so it seems that 3 is 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.530
 would be the best option with respect to 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.270
 vehicles have also been about 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.620
 how many changes first I do not know if 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.120
 you have had problems with 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.770
 shoot both the main cannon of the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.690
 tank like the light machine gun but 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.340
 the truth is that sometimes pointed to 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.200
 center of an objective simply does not 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.760
 gives more this was caused by a bug 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.040
 that made the projectiles not be 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.560
 Straight basically has also been reduced 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.269
 the damage done by m3 20 and xm25 the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.950
 armored vehicles has been reduced 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.019
 also the damage of the lab against others 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.330
 vehicles so that according to them it is used 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.920
 more to shoot infantry the truth is 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.110
 that as an infantry player I do not 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.910
 like nothing but good and for those who 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.350
 you take clips already have a good news 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.030
 the fidh is going to be corrected so that 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.160
 kill someone and do not know in addition to 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.810
 order the elements on the screen as 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.630
 the one that the enemy name dejected 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.520
 leave before the same enemy poster 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.220
 shake and the rest of own elements 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.320
 of the fit about changes in weapons only 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.640
 a change and they could not have touched something 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.470
 worst of all that could have been 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.900
 loaded the lacquer has been reduced to 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.360
 your rounds per minute in bursts mode 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.100
 from a thousand to 750 assuming only 70 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.710
 rounds per minute more than in mode 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.780
 full auto where will have 680 and I would 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.790
 I ask dais because you do not leave things 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.530
 well when they are fine and is that maybe the 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.720
 here 12 was a little cited but without 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.130
 doubt not in your rounds per minute put 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.170
 that conform to reality do not touch 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.670
 that touches something else but do not make a 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.710
 special weapon becomes a weapon 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.530
 of the pile and for those who tell me that 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.810
 kaká 12 was sitting at n 94 had 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.160
 1200 bullets in burst mode and not the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.390
 they touched there I leave it 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.450
 and good kids after that little 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.770
 moment of extreme indignation we are going to 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.210
 say goodbye until the next thousand that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.130
 analysis that will be of the kind of king with 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.420
 I hope to see you there before saying goodbye 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.100
 I also wanted to tell you that this 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.080
 I got information laws zinc point 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.730
 it's a very good news page 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.620
 that I recommend you visit link in the 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.430
 description of course but good we 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.430
 we see in the following guide
