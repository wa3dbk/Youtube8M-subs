00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.219
 I did not think 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.969
 why time is the cost 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.969
 treasure 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 he was elected on the verge 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 his strength with his own eyes 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.140
 lets out windows open above 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.970
 and only 8 heavy 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 it's good that phobos 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.930
 note that can free the sands 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.330
 of time 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.200
 unless of course we allowed 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.020
 destroy the world 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.880
 increased by 3 6 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.990
 the only way to prevent 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
 and we need at the same time a pitiful sight 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 we must do 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.310
 also among the miners are orders 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.380
 because you're good of course don't flatter yourself 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.430
 rescuers 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 this sector 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 now 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.990
 help the poor deliver 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.210
 concerning 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.380
 why then can not he stressed 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.460
 simply 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 I him 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.860
 however do not allow 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 have to go to the end 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.639
 we need to play
