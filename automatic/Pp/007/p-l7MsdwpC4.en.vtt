joseph<00:03:27.799> sethi<00:03:28.040> for<00:03:28.280> heading<00:03:28.639> which<00:03:28.879> again<00:03:29.150> is

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
joseph sethi for heading which again is

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.220 
joseph sethi for heading which again is
pretty<00:03:29.599> good<00:03:29.949> 66<00:03:30.949> defending<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:31.760> 77<00:03:32.690> pace<00:03:32.930> I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
pretty good 66 defending and 77 pace I

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.069 
pretty good 66 defending and 77 pace I
think<00:03:33.889> he's<00:03:34.099> slowest<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.209> my<00:03:35.329> team<00:03:35.569> by<00:03:36.049> the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
think he's slowest on my team by the

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.580 
think he's slowest on my team by the
goalkeeper<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.609> I'm<00:03:37.849> 77<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.079> slowest

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
goalkeeper so I'm 77 is the slowest

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.939 
goalkeeper so I'm 77 is the slowest
isn't<00:03:39.949> too<00:03:40.190> shabby<00:03:40.220> at<00:03:40.609> all<00:03:41.379> now<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.409> life<00:03:42.709> back

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
isn't too shabby at all now a life back

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.509 
isn't too shabby at all now a life back
we<00:03:43.159> have<00:03:43.340> ash<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:44.919> and<00:03:45.919> he<00:03:46.909> has<00:03:47.150> 90<00:03:47.780> pace<00:03:48.079> and

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
we have ash and and he has 90 pace and

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.159 
we have ash and and he has 90 pace and
thats<00:03:49.519> that's<00:03:50.060> his<00:03:50.239> tongue<00:03:50.540> out<00:03:50.659> snapped<00:03:51.019> that

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
thats that's his tongue out snapped that

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.740 
thats that's his tongue out snapped that
90<00:03:51.650> pace<00:03:51.859> but<00:03:52.669> they're<00:03:52.849> mostly<00:03:53.030> plays<00:03:53.449> pretty

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
90 pace but they're mostly plays pretty

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.599 
90 pace but they're mostly plays pretty
quick<00:03:54.049> so<00:03:54.260> that's<00:03:54.470> naturally<00:03:55.129> kind<00:03:55.400> of

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
quick so that's naturally kind of

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.689 
quick so that's naturally kind of
average<00:03:55.790> for<00:03:56.359> my<00:03:56.479> team<00:03:56.750> he<00:03:57.709> isn't<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.489> best

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
average for my team he isn't the best

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.250 
average for my team he isn't the best
he's<00:03:59.620> he's<00:04:00.620> better<00:04:01.099> than<00:04:01.310> win<00:04:01.639> but<00:04:02.419> he<00:04:02.599> isn't

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
he's he's better than win but he isn't

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.979 
he's he's better than win but he isn't
very<00:04:03.849> good<00:04:04.849> compared<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.659> best<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.930> my

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
very good compared to the best of my

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.860 
very good compared to the best of my
defenders<00:04:06.530> mean<00:04:06.769> these<00:04:07.069> two<00:04:07.129> setbacks<00:04:07.810> now<00:04:08.810> we

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
defenders mean these two setbacks now we

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.930 
defenders mean these two setbacks now we
have<00:04:09.139> our<00:04:09.319> set<00:04:09.680> defensive<00:04:10.159> midfielder<00:04:10.699> this

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
have our set defensive midfielder this

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.589 
have our set defensive midfielder this
guy<00:04:11.150> was<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.359> cheapest<00:04:12.109> on<00:04:12.229> my<00:04:12.319> team<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:12.560> think<00:04:13.599> he

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
guy was a cheapest on my team I think he

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.779 
guy was a cheapest on my team I think he
cost<00:04:14.930> me<00:04:15.079> eight<00:04:15.620> hundred<00:04:16.010> coins<00:04:16.130> okay<00:04:16.430> he's<00:04:16.760> a

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
cost me eight hundred coins okay he's a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.000 
cost me eight hundred coins okay he's a
second<00:04:17.299> cheapest<00:04:17.690> he<00:04:18.199> looks<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.440> bit<00:04:18.560> like<00:04:18.620> I'm

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
second cheapest he looks a bit like I'm
