short video I didn't mean to and as you
can<00:05:53.920> see<00:05:53.980> it's<00:05:54.490> not<00:05:54.580> really<00:05:55.290> there<00:05:56.290> but<00:05:56.440> you

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
can see it's not really there but you

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.770 
can see it's not really there but you
can<00:05:57.190> use<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.580> medium<00:05:58.060> on<00:05:58.210> in<00:05:58.300> fact<00:05:58.420> yes<00:05:58.630> I'll

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.480 
can use the medium on in fact yes I'll
show<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:58.990> how<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.170> do<00:05:59.260> that<00:05:59.380> one<00:05:59.530> delete<00:06:00.340> that

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
show you how to do that one delete that

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.700 
show you how to do that one delete that
and<00:06:00.790> I'll<00:06:01.510> show<00:06:01.570> how<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.810> do<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.200> medium<00:06:02.560> one

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
and I'll show how to do the medium one

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:22.370 
and I'll show how to do the medium one
instead<00:06:11.010> look<00:06:12.010> at<00:06:12.100> this<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.310> a<00:06:12.340> medium<00:06:12.610> one<00:06:12.700> and

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.530 

so<00:06:23.380> far<00:06:23.590> but<00:06:23.740> as<00:06:24.040> you<00:06:24.160> can<00:06:24.250> see<00:06:24.400> in<00:06:24.640> cuts<00:06:25.390> that

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
so far but as you can see in cuts that

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.260 
so far but as you can see in cuts that
in<00:06:25.660> the<00:06:25.720> middle<00:06:25.900> of<00:06:25.930> it<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.260> if<00:06:26.350> you<00:06:26.470> go<00:06:26.590> on<00:06:26.740> to

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
in the middle of it so if you go on to

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.390 
in the middle of it so if you go on to
audio<00:06:28.270> adjustments<00:06:28.390> on<00:06:29.050> here<00:06:29.530> you<00:06:29.950> can<00:06:30.160> set

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
audio adjustments on here you can set

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.520 
audio adjustments on here you can set
the<00:06:30.700> fade<00:06:30.940> out<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.540> fade<00:06:31.600> in<00:06:31.990> rarely<00:06:32.500> I

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
the fade out and fade in rarely I

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.590 
the fade out and fade in rarely I
usually<00:06:33.070> a<00:06:33.130> manual<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.150> I'll<00:06:34.240> put<00:06:34.450> it<00:06:34.570> to

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
usually a manual and I'll put it to

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.420 
usually a manual and I'll put it to
about<00:06:35.790> last<00:06:36.790> time<00:06:36.970> I<00:06:37.060> put<00:06:37.240> it<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.450> about<00:06:38.430> three

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
about last time I put it to about three

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.760 
about last time I put it to about three
seconds<00:06:39.910> about<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.540> it<00:06:41.050> should<00:06:41.260> fade<00:06:41.560> out

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
seconds about that it should fade out

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:51.110 
seconds about that it should fade out
just<00:06:42.160> before<00:06:42.370> the<00:06:42.610> end<00:06:42.910> of<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.710> introduction

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120
