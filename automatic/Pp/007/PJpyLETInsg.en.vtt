00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
it's much like it's kind of like George

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.020

Romero<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.650> was<00:03:12.739> living<00:03:12.890> dead<00:03:13.220> it's<00:03:13.850> kind

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
Romero and I was living dead it's kind

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.729 
Romero and I was living dead it's kind
of<00:03:14.120> zombies<00:03:14.540> walking<00:03:14.780> around<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.200> it's

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
of zombies walking around like that it's

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.320 
of zombies walking around like that it's
like<00:03:15.920> they're<00:03:16.190> alive<00:03:16.340> but<00:03:16.640> they're<00:03:16.850> dead<00:03:17.030> I

like they're alive but they're dead I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.640 
like they're alive but they're dead I
think<00:03:18.080> that's<00:03:18.440> when<00:03:19.220> people<00:03:19.400> haven't<00:03:19.850> really

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
think that's when people haven't really

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.240 
think that's when people haven't really
are<00:03:21.650> still<00:03:22.070> conditioned<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:22.940> haven't<00:03:24.250> you

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
are still conditioned and haven't you
