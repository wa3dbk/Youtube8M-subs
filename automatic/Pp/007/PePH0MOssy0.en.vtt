00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
this actually was kind of hard because

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.050 
this actually was kind of hard because
the<00:04:37.380> wrap<00:04:37.560> paper<00:04:37.860> was<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.490> like<00:04:38.670> getting

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the wrap paper was just like getting

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.340 
the wrap paper was just like getting
really<00:04:39.780> an<00:04:40.410> even<00:04:41.400> let's<00:04:41.790> say<00:04:41.940> but<00:04:42.750> once<00:04:43.230> you

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
really an even let's say but once you

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.170 
really an even let's say but once you
get<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.560> hang<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:43.920> it's<00:04:44.190> really<00:04:44.700> fun<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:44.910> do

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
get the hang of it it's really fun to do

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.000 
get the hang of it it's really fun to do
and<00:04:45.420> it's<00:04:45.930> really<00:04:46.050> unique<00:04:46.530> because<00:04:46.620> no<00:04:46.860> one

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
and it's really unique because no one

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.060 
and it's really unique because no one
has<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.400> so
