00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.200
 yes 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.089
 so my fight 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.089
 with simple 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.890
 and me 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.609
 returned places 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.609
 I am very believing 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.250
 lesson 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.190
 i 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.970
 whatever it is 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.079
 Y 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.080
 there is that it is finished it finishes it finishes nothing 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.020
 if you 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.030
 I can compensate 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.820
 anytime 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.690
 father how is it called also 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.110
 Father also Father David resounds that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.110
 it sounds 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.290
 Chau how well you're not given me 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.480
 the return because it did not convince me much 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 the voice in some points yes but no 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.790
 lies is one of those who are here 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 because you want to profess the word of 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.319
 God through music during the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.300
 contest I thank you for having done 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.070
 I want to know what you want to sing 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.480
 first I want to tell you is that my 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.239
 first dream was the music from 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 I've dreamed of being a singer and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.260
 then I wanted to give a sense to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.890
 my life and especially since being 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.870
 missionary who is what I am not therefore 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.470
 I'm here and that's why I 've put this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.880
 heart only just to sing love in 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.880
 the world not for nothing else 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.120
 I love that you are a missionary I think 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.830
 the missionary people are very 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.650
 special because you have to be very 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.980
 special 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.200
 brave and very brave I think 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.209
 also very brave you are today 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.220
 here you want to sing love 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.989
 universal and that you take all kinds of 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.489
 prejudices over 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.730
 I would love you to be in my 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.319
 team would make me a lot of hope 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.319
 you would have a perfect place in it for you 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.910
 I have to say I do not know very well 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.020
 what I turned around I think it has been a 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.370
 Celestial call to definitely me 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.380
 I think you and I could do something 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.360
 together something important I think that I 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.010
 could help you win the word if you 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.910
 could you help enter the sky 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.910
 because I do not have any points left 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.800
 I know very closely the work that you do 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.330
 the missionaries in the world I will tell you that 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.980
 is much beyond faith and the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.750
 churches and the temples and the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.970
 gods are the people who are 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.050
 able to mortgage your life for the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.050
 others if I applaud you for that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.879
 obviously I want my team good father 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.129
 you choose 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.229
 with which of the two you stay we do not 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:32.090
 have on embers 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.090
 good if you are two great artists 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.140
 I'm really excited about 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.840
 to be here 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.300
 I really love but 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.660
 all be within the voice however 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.660
 all 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.690
 feeling it a lot the light I go with 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.690
 history
