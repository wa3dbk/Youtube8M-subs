00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 wanted to climb like that at the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.699
 firefighters we train every 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.699
 days for that I will teach you 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 first thing excuse me 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.060
 go ahead go for a little bit of agreement 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.480
 very simple so two things already the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.489
 carpets to protect themselves in case there is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 will have a fall in case we have a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 problem with the arms precisely 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.469
 because the principal in on this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.210
 rigging 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.250
 it's having arms then 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 will also use these people so as we have 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 could not see him from 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 firefighters without touching the ground 5 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
 the feet touch the ground we will start 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.489
 our ascent for ascension we go 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 bring for example his right arm 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.680
 associated with each left leg at the moment 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.379
 where we are going to draw we will make our note 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 reflecting our arm flexion we are going 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.769
 bring his left arm over the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.070
 right hand 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:16.409
 by pairing his right leg up 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.030
 so up to the top of the horn and one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.790
 makes our descent using the arms or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.040
 also using these people for 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 conclude we gave you the technique there 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 is more than just training but 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.710
 do not forget the first thing the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.710
 first rule the carpet
