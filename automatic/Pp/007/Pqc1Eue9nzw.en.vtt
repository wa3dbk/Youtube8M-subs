00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:54.470
 show how what is connected 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.099
 so that it is more clear why I 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.769
 suggest 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:04.459

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.289
 comments and comments 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 depending on the number of these estimates 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.190
 as well as the number of views will be 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.810
 clearly need d 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.790

 also well I will say after the release of this video 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.359

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.280
 it will be clear whether to shoot 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:08.180
 bother me shooting data 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.459
 video also the sewing process will be 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.109
 long enough because now 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.349
 there is not enough time colors and based on 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:23.120
 this i ask right away 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:24.849
