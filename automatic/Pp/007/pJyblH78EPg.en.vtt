00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.330
 hello good I'll prepare a rose at 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.310
 curry as I like the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.820
 ingredients that I will use will be a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.550
 chicken breast an onion 1 egg 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 curry salt olive oil and the rice that 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 I have it boiled 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 Well, when we have everything ready and 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.060
 the oil is hot 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.060
 the first thing that we will throw will be the onion 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.579
 and a pinch of salt 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 We'll come back a little bit and wait 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.350
 to brown that it hurts a little 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.370
 when the onion is already beginning to brown 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.200
 we will add the chicken breast well 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.110
 cut that I have agreed with a 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.100
 scissors 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.100
 and we also add a pinch of salt 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.090
 we will move well until the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 well made breast 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.750
 when we see that the pieces of 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.259
 breast are already well done we will add 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.259
 rice 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.330
 all 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.610
 and I will also put 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.610
 occur 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.130
 and now we will move everything very well 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.750
 when we have it all well mixed 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.400
 now finally I'll add the clear 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.189
 of an egg that separated the yolk from the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 clear and I will only throw the clear that 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.970
 add a pinch of salt 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.470
 and now we will move everything very well 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.470
 that is well mixed 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.190
 because I spent a couple of minutes and will be 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190
 ready 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.310
