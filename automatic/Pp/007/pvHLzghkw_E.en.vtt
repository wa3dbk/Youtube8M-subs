to<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.440> reviewing<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.450> rival<00:00:12.450> SB<00:00:12.960> 150<00:00:13.769> solid

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
to be reviewing the rival SB 150 solid

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.710 
to be reviewing the rival SB 150 solid
single<00:00:14.940> burner<00:00:16.789> all<00:00:17.789> right<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.480> coolest

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
single burner all right the coolest

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800 
single burner all right the coolest
feature<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.949> rival<00:00:20.340> SB<00:00:20.789> 150<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
feature of the the rival SB 150 is that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.320 
feature of the the rival SB 150 is that
it<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> only<00:00:22.529> nine<00:00:23.279> hundred<00:00:23.609> watt<00:00:23.850> burner

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it is only nine hundred watt burner

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.400 
it is only nine hundred watt burner
instead<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.529> its<00:00:26.010> rivals<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.670> produce

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
instead of the its rivals which produce

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.509 
instead of the its rivals which produce
over<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.590> thousand<00:00:28.980> watts<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> our

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
over one thousand watts some of our

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
over one thousand watts some of our
twelve<00:00:29.789> thirteen<00:00:30.179> hundred<00:00:30.449> watts<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
twelve thirteen hundred watts I like the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.020 
twelve thirteen hundred watts I like the
idea<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.099> being<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> nine<00:00:32.550> hundred<00:00:32.700> watt

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
idea of this being a nine hundred watt

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
idea of this being a nine hundred watt
burner<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.500> were<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.829> operate<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
burner because if I were to operate this

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
burner because if I were to operate this
with<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> power<00:00:36.210> outage<00:00:37.140> situation<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:40.290> run

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
with a power outage situation I can run

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.250 
with a power outage situation I can run
this<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.309> small<00:00:41.820> generator<00:00:42.149> say<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> 1000

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this off of a small generator say a 1000

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.130 
this off of a small generator say a 1000
watt<00:00:43.350> continuous<00:00:44.010> run<00:00:44.730> generator<00:00:45.329> without

watt continuous run generator without

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.950 
watt continuous run generator without
any<00:00:46.289> issues<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.370> were<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.760> plug<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
any issues if you were to plug one of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
any issues if you were to plug one of
the<00:00:49.020> larger<00:00:49.500> competitor<00:00:50.039> burners<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the larger competitor burners in that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
the larger competitor burners in that
are<00:00:51.180> twelve<00:00:51.539> thirteen<00:00:51.899> hundred<00:00:52.140> watts<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
are twelve thirteen hundred watts into a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
are twelve thirteen hundred watts into a
small<00:00:53.430> generator<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.300> you're<00:00:54.480> not

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
small generator like that you're not

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.610 
small generator like that you're not
going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> able<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.140> run<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.559> an

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
going to be able to run it for an

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to be able to run it for an
extended<00:00:55.920> period<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> time<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.460> all<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
extended period of time at all it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.689 
extended period of time at all it's
going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> cause<00:00:57.600> issues<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> idea

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going to cause issues so I like the idea

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.010 
going to cause issues so I like the idea
of<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.090> nine<00:01:00.239> hundred<00:01:00.539> watts<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of going with nine hundred watts it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.570 
of going with nine hundred watts it
heats<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.710> pan<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> water<00:01:03.949> about<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> panda<00:01:05.369> bar

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
heats a pan of water about a panda bar

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
heats a pan of water about a panda bar
about<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> size<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.810> three<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> four

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
about this size in about three to four

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
about this size in about three to four
minutes<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.400> longer<00:01:08.790> than<00:01:08.970> some

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
minutes that's a little longer than some

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.399 
minutes that's a little longer than some
of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.450> high<00:01:09.659> wattage<00:01:09.900> burners<00:01:10.380> but

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of the other high wattage burners but

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
of the other high wattage burners but
again<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:12.119> run<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> small

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
again I can run this on a small

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.240 
again I can run this on a small
generator<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.619> mind<00:01:13.799> waiting<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.220> little

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
generator I don't mind waiting a little

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.910 
generator I don't mind waiting a little
longer<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.450> able<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> heat<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.170> heat<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.799> my

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
longer to be able to heat up heat up my

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640 
longer to be able to heat up heat up my
water<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.460> cook<00:01:17.909> some<00:01:18.060> food<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.659> cool<00:01:18.869> one

thing as far as safety with this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.520 
thing as far as safety with this
particular<00:01:21.960> burner<00:01:22.680> goes<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.880> does<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.530> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
particular burner goes it does not it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
does not glow in any way shape or form
when<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.869> operating<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.460> going

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
going to cause a nasty burn so yeah you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.090 
going to cause a nasty burn so yeah you
won't<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> operate<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.409> anywhere<00:01:43.829> near

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
won't want to operate this anywhere near

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.990 
won't want to operate this anywhere near
the<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.520> kids<00:01:44.790> um<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.490> far<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.729> the
