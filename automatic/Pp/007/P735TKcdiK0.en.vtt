 of judgment and that he had taken to the ship 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.860

 according to the witness statements 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.769
 boat came dangerously close to the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.049
 coast in compliance with a rite that 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.000
 sounds the sirens when approaching 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.480

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 passengers and those on the ground 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.370
 a strong explosion followed by a 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.340
 electrical blackout during dinner was the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.950
 first indication that something was wrong 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.890
 the boat overturned on one of its sides 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.950
 in waters of a depth of 15 to 20

 hundred meters from the coast 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.629
 then the 4000 229 passengers 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.069
 they began to live hours of panic 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.709
 several videos recorded on the phones 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.379
 cell phones show chaos and 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.380
 despair aggravated by the incompetence 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.660
 of the crew in front of the emergency 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.760
 the evacuation test on the cruise 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.720
 it was scheduled for the afternoon of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.380

 tragic end
