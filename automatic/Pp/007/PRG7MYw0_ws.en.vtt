this<00:00:01.829> video<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:03.120> gonna<00:00:03.360> tell<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.689> about<00:00:03.750> a

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
this video I'm gonna tell you about a

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.260 
this video I'm gonna tell you about a
new<00:00:04.080> way<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.319> build<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.680> robot<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.279> way<00:00:05.940> that's

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
new way to build a robot a way that's

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.240 
new way to build a robot a way that's
easier<00:00:06.839> than<00:00:07.080> any<00:00:07.290> other<00:00:07.560> way<00:00:07.799> you've<00:00:08.069> ever

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
easier than any other way you've ever

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.839 
easier than any other way you've ever
seen<00:00:09.469> you<00:00:10.469> can<00:00:10.590> control<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.130> robot<00:00:11.250> like<00:00:11.639> this

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
seen you can control the robot like this

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.849 
seen you can control the robot like this
one<00:00:12.170> it's<00:00:13.170> small<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.900> it's<00:00:15.900> powered<00:00:16.289> by<00:00:16.320> DC

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
motors as you can see here robots need

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.450 
motors as you can see here robots need
more<00:00:21.449> than<00:00:21.600> motors<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.920> also<00:00:23.100> need

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
more than motors though they also need

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.200 
more than motors though they also need

let's<00:06:43.669> take<00:06:43.880> a<00:06:43.910> look<00:06:44.180> at<00:06:44.270> how<00:06:44.389> we<00:06:44.449> can<00:06:44.690> use<00:06:44.960> the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
let's take a look at how we can use the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.129 
let's take a look at how we can use the

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.879 
control that arm over the same radio
link<00:06:53.949> here's<00:06:54.949> the<00:06:55.130> arm<00:06:56.169> this<00:06:57.169> is<00:06:57.380> one<00:06:57.560> that<00:06:57.770> we

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
link here's the arm this is one that we

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.939
