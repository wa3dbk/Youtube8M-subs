00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.760
 often go to snow or steal no rain 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.960
 that the cuff will be very relevant 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.129

 mobile phone pocket ie 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.469

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.849
 if the temperature is still very low 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.040
 or you catch on live nozzles then this 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.310
 the best place to keep them cool 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.760

 from more polish material to 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.299
 the jacket did not linger while walking 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.980
