00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.930
 make it possible every day that we can 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.490
 cook more quickly and in terms of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.550
 television times 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.980
 so two tablespoons of oil 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.790

 that you have left over from some other preparation 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.679

 Suddenly it is a magic magical magical 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.740
 magical good I made this sautÃ©ed and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.510
 given that the chicken was already 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.870
 is cooked is very easy and we already have it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.300
 Meanwhile here in this helmet 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.790
 don marquitos motorcycle, let's continue 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.700
 incorporating ingredients for example 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.250
 here we have some guys that 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.989
 they were this grain they pass me I'm going to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.720
 eat here I will add it to the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.080
 Spicy preparation goes the corn in 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.930
 grain the grated corn that's for two 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.840
 situations are reasons organically or 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.800
 because the grated corn is going to give 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.800
 a creaminess 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.360
 and pro-literate style that you're going to 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.210
 put now that is the shock of the grain 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.870
 it will generate a nice texture when 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.340
 you are going to discover the interior of 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.340
 this cake coiled 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.570
 and it looks great with onions 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.600
 and with the chick with the town so 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.910
 see how easy you get this 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.480
 directly corn kernels compression 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.720

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.230
 teeth 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:16.060
 what you want 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.440
 and now what we need is also 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.190
 incorporate this we are going to make a 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.680
 program a link true don would be going 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.170
