 I bring you how to make the easter age the 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.589
 origins I know how good they got it 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.959
 a lot for the child is special because what 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.849
 I did I edit the video and I did it 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.190
 with a lot of dedication for you up 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.590
 I did it twice because he recorded us 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.810
 so good thank you very much for 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.789
 stay subscribed after being a 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.590
 week or week and a half I'm not video 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.599
 I was not given a mental gap I'm sorry 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.239
 a lot but good to be here going up 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.759
 tutorials of scepters the and all that well 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.399
 how good I know they want me to shut up 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.100
 and shows them the distress and then I'm 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.829
 already taught them here they will see the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.649
 things that they will need and I think they are 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.989
 all then good are all 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.239
 Improved centers mortar monkeys 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.190
 monkey markers as you want to call the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.280
 region of preference in sleeve 2 for 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.489
 one step with the welded panthers 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 then the point of air consumption as 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.320
 you want to call the max and scion 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.420
 patience and effort dedication and the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.950
 they really do not try or do not have 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.950
 patience will never come out 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.830
 and it came out to me without dedicating myself well 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.830
 luck but if you do not have patience never 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.110
 it's going to come out I'm 100% sure 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.150
 so good the first step of this 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.980
 I advance a bit because if it does not give me 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.970
 the time the first step is going to be 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.470
 improve the centers and well I will 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.930
 put a little bit of flame gameplay 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.430
 when we say that the last step of 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.610
 improve the centers that will be fed 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.820
 soul will make the more 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.250
 practically that's about all the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.759
 mister and reads the bone game origins is 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.210
 feed for almost everything then good 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.330
 from here I already have my fire scepter said 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.540
 forgive me 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.610
 and good this these centers improved the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.650
 we're going to have to put in giants one 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 he killed himself there we're going to put the one on 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.120
 electricity a 'modding' in this 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 we put the wind and one is called 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.280
 flee in this we are going to have to put the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.850
 center d 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.160
 of ice and fire but then 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.880
 I teach you then, here we have 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 actor getting into our center in the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.980
 bull 's head somehow 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.890
 and here we have good to frei thus getting 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.760
 then the ice and then we have Saudi 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.890
 getting our wind center the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.209
 fire where we put it good well where 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.299
 we collect our centers 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.040
 mainly originally there they go to 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.280
 be good there will be like that the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.230
 last place and there it gets and after 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540
 this is going to come out the three robots 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.299
 constantly walking every 30 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.790
 seconds in these robots is going to have a 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.959
 button but only good we will be able to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.340
 put in one every time there we see it and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.230
 after putting we have to press 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.480
 the button that I am telling you here what 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.129
 let's see and there comes a partner that 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.200
 is going to have to be in the state not 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.760
 worry now I teach you where to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.819
 when we squeeze it lanzone monkey 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.209
 mortar towards the location that 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.299
 I tell them then we squeeze it there and 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.879
 we see as our partner a wind in 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.020
 mount mortar in generator 5 next 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:21.410
 in the barn as more are located to that 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.710
 instead of cement in some way 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.330
 and practice and mortars yes they did 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.150
 well they will have to destroy that segment and 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.690
 it makes a hole is a very simple step 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.760
 but if they do not coordinate, it's not going to come out 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.880
 and after that we're going to have to 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.370
 throw a maxi strong to the ceo and here what 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.710
 let's see and from this hole here is 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.280
 when we need the wheels marc 2 go 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.130
 out 8 are soldiering giants 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.440
 little ones or as they call them they are going to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.250
 leave 8 so be very careful about that 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.510
 I recommend the region and so good luck 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.330
 to everyone who does not 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.130
 fail and after that we're going to 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.900
 need are my blog I would recommend 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.330
 leave it from the beginning because they left it 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.700
 we have to hit him some races 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.710
 we are looking at the locations and that 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.420
 do these good carts shooting at you 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.570
 these carts with the ice center 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.700
 improved I do not know if I have improved if I 'm not 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.630
 improved serve us but shooting 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.110
 those are going to give us a zombie 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.970
 blog then good then it is not so 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.430
 difficult to remove it but I recommend leaving the 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.650
 from the beginning you ask and have in castellÃ³ 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.690
 what of what he is teaching them 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.620
 here but good, that's how the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.260
 things and if so they were so recorded 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.660
 and good is going to be the zombie blog in the 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.630
 excavation site here we see as our 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.520
 mate grabs him and while they are they are 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.960
 Byblos is going to have to destroy an airplane 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.970
 what are you going to do as if we wanted to 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.120
 grab a part of the center of fire 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.970
 I think more or less than being shining and 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.560
 there will not fall any more piece goes 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.300
 to drop a good zombie here we are 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.509
 watching how he shoots 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.909
 this and we're going to have to kill the zombie 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.060
 that only the zombie blogger fell 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.800
 will be able to see anyone else and we will 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.590
 give an exhibition that will be for the 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.900
 final step 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.970
 after this step we are going to have to 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.650
 go again to the excavation site with 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.390
 our ancestors where we are going to have 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.390
 to kill with our fists of kung fu 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.740
 that's how it arises I do not feel this with our 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.040
 fists of kung fu are going to have to kill 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.290
 or take it off if we're already in round 19 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.810
 up the white hands to the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.140
 zombies is not difficult because although 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.830
 dispares is not erased as your progress 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.380
 and then when they know that they did what 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.990
 they have to do all 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.940
 postscript somehow I have to 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:53.370
 do all of them and it's going to work out 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:57.169
 a pack somehow and they see it 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.490
 and it already gives them like their fists 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.409
 element that you bring in the center 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.239
 as for example the fire sight 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.769
 and look for who has the ice seal 

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:10.539
 wind then is very father and what 

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:13.330
 could use but even for more than 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.260
 hysterical then we go to the last step 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.680
 in the last step we have to go to 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.300
 to the crazy place the king will be pleased and place 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.970
 our centers in the places that 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.540
 correspond as I said we have to 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.160
 feed souls kill zombies there not 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.580
 it matters on which side but inside the 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.140
 place what we already killed there the 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.400
 souls good the zombies sorry now what 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.560
 let's find out why he's going to give us a 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.750
 flashazo or a white screen and what 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.010
 we are seeing and the trophy I think 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.280
 right now they are listening to our 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.280
 Expressions 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.930
 and well after this screenshot 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.320
 we have to throw a maxi sound at this 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.500
 as a center to give us the 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.720
 kinematics according to I do not know I do not know if I do not 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.220
 they do and the kinematics will not be 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.050
 in this video for people who do not know 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.940
 wants to spoil so I'm going to 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.700
 leave in another annotation to be seen 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.050
 thank you very much for watching like favorites is 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.230
