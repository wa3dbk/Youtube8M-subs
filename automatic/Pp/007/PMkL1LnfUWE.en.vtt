00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
clay to make a mold and then use the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.740 
clay to make a mold and then use the
mold<00:00:23.669> to<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:25.220> charm<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.360> use<00:00:27.539> to

mold to make a charm that you can use to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.470 
mold to make a charm that you can use to
decorate<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:28.349> pages<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.269> thing

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
decorate your pages so the first thing

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.140 
decorate your pages so the first thing
you<00:00:30.630> want<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.550> polymer<00:00:32.970> clay

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
you want to do is take your polymer clay

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.119 
you want to do is take your polymer clay
I<00:00:33.559> usually<00:00:34.559> use<00:00:35.120> sculpey<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.769> when<00:00:37.769> it<00:00:37.890> first

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I usually use sculpey and when it first

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.770 
I usually use sculpey and when it first
comes<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.519> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> package<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.330> pretty

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
comes out of the package it's pretty

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.390 
comes out of the package it's pretty
tough<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> work<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
tough to work with so you have to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.090 
tough to work with so you have to
probably<00:00:41.610> spend<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.540> don't<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.720> ten<00:00:43.680> minutes

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
probably spend I don't know ten minutes

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.450 
probably spend I don't know ten minutes
and<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.640> really<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.930> roll<00:00:46.799> it<00:00:47.040> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and just really kind of roll it and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.140 
and just really kind of roll it and
knead<00:00:47.909> it<00:00:48.089> until<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.680> soft<00:00:49.979> and<00:00:50.519> then

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
knead it until it's really soft and then

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.049 
knead it until it's really soft and then
the<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:51.720> step<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:53.540> making<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.680> mold<00:00:56.100> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the first step is making the mold so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.649 
the first step is making the mold so
what<00:00:57.299> you're<00:00:57.449> gonna<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.869> is<00:00:58.320> shape<00:00:58.830> it<00:00:59.659> into

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
what you're gonna do is shape it into

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.509 
what you're gonna do is shape it into
the<00:01:01.500> shape<00:01:01.619> that<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.309> want<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:04.040> then<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the shape that you want and then I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.929 
the shape that you want and then I
always<00:01:06.360> use<00:01:06.810> cornstarch<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:08.610> dust<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.540> mold

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
always use cornstarch to dust my mold

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.880 
always use cornstarch to dust my mold
that<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.240> whatever<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:13.020> pushing<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that way whatever I'm pushing into the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.300 
that way whatever I'm pushing into the
clay<00:01:14.930> won't<00:01:15.930> stick

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
clay won't stick

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.740 
clay won't stick
so<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:19.170> take<00:01:19.860> some<00:01:20.160> cornstarch<00:01:20.550> dust<00:01:21.480> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so just take some cornstarch dust it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
so just take some cornstarch dust it
over<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.460> clay<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.870> then<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.070> gonna

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
over the clay and then what we're gonna

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.720 
over the clay and then what we're gonna
make<00:01:26.670> today<00:01:27.120> is<00:01:27.480> this<00:01:27.720> key<00:01:28.370> we're<00:01:29.370> gonna<00:01:29.490> make

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
make today is this key we're gonna make

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.399 
make today is this key we're gonna make
a<00:01:29.760> mold<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> key<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.230> just

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
a mold out of the key so then you just

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.250 
a mold out of the key so then you just
take<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.680> key<00:01:32.270> you're<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.360> push<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.990> down

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
take the key you're gonna push it down

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.240 
take the key you're gonna push it down
into<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.550> clay<00:01:38.510> okay<00:01:39.620> you're<00:01:40.620> gonna<00:01:40.770> pull<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
into the clay okay you're gonna pull it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
into the clay okay you're gonna pull it
out<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.870> can<00:01:43.050> see<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.620> it<00:01:43.740> made<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.550> mold

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
out and you can see that it made a mold

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.980 
out and you can see that it made a mold
there<00:01:46.550> then<00:01:47.550> what<00:01:47.760> you're<00:01:47.909> gonna<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.360> is

oven you'll have a mold and it'll be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.680 
oven you'll have a mold and it'll be
hard<00:02:20.999> and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
hard and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.470 
hard and
