hey this is Josh from Josh Milton today

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.810 
hey this is Josh from Josh Milton today
I'm<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.130> showing<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.639> make

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
I'm going to be showing you how to make

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.339 
I'm going to be showing you how to make
this<00:00:08.970> car<00:00:09.269> right<00:00:09.450> here<00:00:09.480> now<00:00:10.170> what's

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
this car right here now what's

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.959 
this car right here now what's
interesting<00:00:10.530> about<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.460> normally<00:00:11.820> when

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
interesting about this is normally when

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.270 
interesting about this is normally when
you<00:00:12.059> make<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> car<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.040> some

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
you make a car you have to have some

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
you make a car you have to have some
sort<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.549> small<00:00:14.790> little<00:00:15.030> big<00:00:15.360> gear<00:00:15.599> ratio<00:00:16.020> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
sort of small little big gear ratio to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.200 
sort of small little big gear ratio to
overcome<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.770> force<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.160> friction<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:18.000> here

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
overcome the force of friction but here

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.000 
overcome the force of friction but here
instead<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> using<00:00:18.900> gears<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
instead of using gears we just have a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740 
instead of using gears we just have a
little<00:00:20.340> friction<00:00:20.670> drive<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> motor<00:00:21.630> on

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
little friction drive with the motor on

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.210 
little friction drive with the motor on
the<00:00:21.779> wheel<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.289> let<00:00:22.619> me<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.890> how<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the wheel now let me show you how it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:34.220 
the wheel now let me show you how it
works<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:32.880> start<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.360> we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> get

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
works so to start off we're going to get

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
works so to start off we're going to get
a<00:00:34.290> piece<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.680> foamboard<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.340> start<00:00:35.550> pulling

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a piece of foamboard and start pulling

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
a piece of foamboard and start pulling
the<00:00:36.059> paper<00:00:36.420> off<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> now<00:00:37.440> foam<00:00:37.770> board<00:00:38.010> has

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the paper off it now foam board has

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950 
the paper off it now foam board has
paper<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.730> both<00:00:38.910> sides<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.540> foam<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
paper on both sides and foam in the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.450 
paper on both sides and foam in the
middle<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.590> ahead<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> pull<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> paper

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
middle so go ahead and pull the paper
off<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.760> both<00:00:42.090> sides<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> foam<00:00:42.930> board<00:00:45.410> now

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
off of both sides of the foam board now

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
off of both sides of the foam board now
I<00:00:46.440> went<00:00:46.739> ahead<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> grabbed<00:00:47.250> again<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:48.149> can

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I went ahead and grabbed again this can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
I went ahead and grabbed again this can
has<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> diameter<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.350> 8<00:00:49.559> centimeters<00:00:49.969> I'm

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
has a diameter of 8 centimeters I'm

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.549 
has a diameter of 8 centimeters I'm
going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.329> use<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> same<00:00:51.989> piece<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> foam

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
going to go use the same piece of foam

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.799 
going to go use the same piece of foam
board<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.090> stripped<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> paper

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
board that we that we stripped the paper

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
board that we that we stripped the paper
off<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.640> I've<00:00:56.730> already

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
off of and as you can see I've already

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
off of and as you can see I've already
done<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> few<00:00:57.420> other<00:00:57.750> wheels<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.530> we're

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
done a few other wheels but what we're

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.779 
done a few other wheels but what we're
going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.100> we're<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> push<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
going to do is we're going to push the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.979 
going to do is we're going to push the
cannon<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> nice<00:01:01.050> big<00:01:01.890> outline<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.989> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
cannon to make a nice big outline of a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
cannon to make a nice big outline of a
circle<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> diameter<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.250> 8<00:01:05.400> centimeters

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
circle with a diameter of 8 centimeters

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.480 
circle with a diameter of 8 centimeters
and<00:01:06.260> it's<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> act<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.770> our<00:01:07.920> wheel<00:01:08.100> now

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and it's going to act as our wheel now

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
and it's going to act as our wheel now
I'm<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> prop<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.510> books<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.049> can

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I'm going to prop it up on books you can

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
I'm going to prop it up on books you can
use<00:01:10.350> books<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.860> something<00:01:11.340> else<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> I'm

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
use books or something else and I'm

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
use books or something else and I'm
going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> cut<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> exacto

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
going to cut it out with the exacto

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
going to cut it out with the exacto
knife<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.850> year<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.540> one

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
knife so this year is going to be one

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
knife so this year is going to be one
wheel<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> cut

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
wheel and you're going to have to cut

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
wheel and you're going to have to cut
out<00:01:17.460> four<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> have

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
out four of these so that we can have

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
out four of these so that we can have
four<00:01:19.740> wheels<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> car<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.390> go

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
four wheels for the car so you can go

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
four wheels for the car so you can go
ahead<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.830> me<00:01:22.950> fast-forward<00:01:23.280> through

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
ahead and see me fast-forward through

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
ahead and see me fast-forward through
this<00:01:23.820> coming<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:25.350> wheel<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
this coming out this wheel here and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
this coming out this wheel here and
again<00:01:27.000> you'll<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:28.110> all

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
again you'll have to do it for these all

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
again you'll have to do it for these all
the<00:01:29.070> sins<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> first<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.329> we're<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the sins of first one now we're going to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
the sins of first one now we're going to
move<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> body<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> car<00:01:31.890> we're

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
move on to the body of the car we're

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.740 
move on to the body of the car we're
going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> make<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.939> rectangle<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
going to make it a rectangle that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
going to make it a rectangle that
dimensions<00:01:34.530> eight<00:01:34.740> centimeters<00:01:35.369> wide<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.970> 20

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
dimensions eight centimeters wide but 20

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.230 
dimensions eight centimeters wide but 20
centimeters<00:01:37.170> long<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.979> initially<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.729> made

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
centimeters long now initially I made

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.380 
centimeters long now initially I made
mine<00:01:39.509> eight<00:01:40.229> by<00:01:40.530> twelve<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.729> realize<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
mine eight by twelve and then realize it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
mine eight by twelve and then realize it
was<00:01:42.479> too<00:01:42.659> short<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.290> had<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
was too short and then had to go and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
was too short and then had to go and
make<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.250> longer<00:01:44.399> afterwards<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.630> can

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
make it longer afterwards so you can

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
make it longer afterwards so you can
save<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.409> trouble<00:01:46.770> by<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.250> making

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
save all that trouble by just making

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.120 
save all that trouble by just making
yours<00:01:47.670> 8<00:01:47.909> by<00:01:48.090> 20<00:01:48.479> off<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.229> bat<00:01:49.409> instead<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> 8

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
yours 8 by 20 off the bat instead of 8

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.950 
yours 8 by 20 off the bat instead of 8
by<00:01:50.310> 12<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.909> did<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> video<00:01:51.420> here

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
by 12 like I did in the video here

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.300 
by 12 like I did in the video here
now<00:01:53.260> we're<00:01:53.410> going<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> go<00:01:53.740> ahead<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.100> make<00:01:54.190> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
now we're going to go ahead and make the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.640 
now we're going to go ahead and make the
wheel<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.700> axle<00:01:55.060> assembly<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.660> found<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.440> dowel

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
wheel and axle assembly I found a dowel

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.530 
wheel and axle assembly I found a dowel
from<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> dollar<00:01:57.430> store<00:01:57.580> they<00:01:57.940> have<00:01:58.060> big<00:01:58.300> sets

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
from the dollar store they have big sets

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.260 
from the dollar store they have big sets
of<00:01:58.690> dowels<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.890> found<00:02:00.220> one<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.730> set

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
of dowels and I found one in that set

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.140 
of dowels and I found one in that set
that<00:02:01.540> fits<00:02:02.110> inside<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.650> straw<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.220> our<00:02:03.550> axle

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
that fits inside of a straw so our axle

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.730 
that fits inside of a straw so our axle
is<00:02:04.210> going<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.420> rotate<00:02:04.600> inside<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.470> straw

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
is going to rotate inside of the straw

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.370 
is going to rotate inside of the straw
and<00:02:06.240> I'm<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.450> cut<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> straw<00:02:07.990> out<00:02:08.020> I

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
and I'm going to cut the straw out I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.710 
and I'm going to cut the straw out I
actually<00:02:08.920> cut<00:02:09.429> mine<00:02:09.610> too<00:02:09.820> short<00:02:10.179> later<00:02:10.479> you'll

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
actually cut mine too short later you'll

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.510 
actually cut mine too short later you'll
see<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.959> have<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.410> longer<00:02:11.830> one<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.100> place<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.490> that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
see I have a longer one in place of that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.040 
see I have a longer one in place of that
one<00:02:12.820> there<00:02:13.000> but<00:02:13.510> you're<00:02:13.630> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> want<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
one there but you're going to want to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.080 
one there but you're going to want to
cut<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.410> little<00:02:14.800> wider<00:02:15.070> than<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> base<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:15.910> 9

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
cut it a little wider than the base so 9

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.410 
cut it a little wider than the base so 9
centimeters<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.080> safe<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.880> then<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.240> have

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
centimeters to be safe and then we have

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.050 
centimeters to be safe and then we have
to<00:02:19.600> find<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> center<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.920> wheel<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.880> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
to find the center of the wheel so that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.570 
to find the center of the wheel so that
we<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.390> poke<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> hole<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.980> got<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> book

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
we can poke a hole in it so I got a book

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.050 
we can poke a hole in it so I got a book
and<00:02:24.959> anything<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.050> prop<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.290> up<00:02:26.500> really<00:02:26.860> and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and anything to prop it up really and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.449 
and anything to prop it up really and
draw<00:02:28.060> two<00:02:28.330> lines<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:29.040> rotate<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.250> as<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
draw two lines and rotate it but as you

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.710 
draw two lines and rotate it but as you
can<00:02:30.610> see<00:02:30.760> those<00:02:30.910> lines<00:02:31.120> aren't<00:02:31.300> too<00:02:31.480> close<00:02:31.690> so

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
can see those lines aren't too close so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.130 
can see those lines aren't too close so
I<00:02:31.930> prop<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.320> up<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.530> little<00:02:32.770> more<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.900> draw<00:02:34.900> two

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
I prop it up a little more and draw two

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.370 
I prop it up a little more and draw two
more<00:02:35.350> lines<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.510> as<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:37.900> see<00:02:38.050> those<00:02:38.230> are

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
more lines and as you can see those are

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.260 
more lines and as you can see those are
a<00:02:38.410> lot<00:02:38.590> closer<00:02:38.920> together<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.910> now<00:02:40.060> I'll<00:02:40.150> draw

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
a lot closer together so now I'll draw

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.800 
a lot closer together so now I'll draw
two<00:02:40.330> lines<00:02:40.750> sideways<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.780> it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
two lines sideways and there we have it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.449 
two lines sideways and there we have it
the<00:02:44.140> center's<00:02:44.500> right<00:02:44.709> there<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.070> that's<00:02:45.250> where

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
the center's right there so that's where

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.210 
the center's right there so that's where
our<00:02:45.550> axle<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.030> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.239> get<00:02:46.360> poked<00:02:46.630> through

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
our axle is going to get poked through

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.130 
our axle is going to get poked through
next<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.430> want<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:49.150> able<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.390> put<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.750> axle

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
next we want to be able to put the axle

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.510 
next we want to be able to put the axle
through<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> wheels<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.010> do<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.220> I'm

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
through the wheels so to do that I'm

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.430 
through the wheels so to do that I'm
going<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.730> sharpen<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.239> axle<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.290> poke

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
going to sharpen the axle so I can poke

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.990 
going to sharpen the axle so I can poke
a<00:02:53.470> hole<00:02:53.590> through<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> wheel<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.850> use

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
a hole through the wheel and I just use

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.870 
a hole through the wheel and I just use
a<00:02:55.030> normal<00:02:55.540> pencil<00:02:55.750> sharpener<00:02:56.290> for<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:57.850> I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
a normal pencil sharpener for that now I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.670 
a normal pencil sharpener for that now I
can<00:02:58.239> poke<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.720> through<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.019> center<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.350> found

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
can poke it through the center I found

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.620 
can poke it through the center I found
and<00:02:59.980> don't<00:03:00.519> forget<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.880> have<00:03:00.910> four<00:03:01.180> wheels<00:03:01.420> so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
and don't forget you have four wheels so

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.370 
and don't forget you have four wheels so
you<00:03:01.720> can<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.230> all<00:03:02.320> four<00:03:02.590> wheels<00:03:04.350> here<00:03:05.350> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
you can do it for all four wheels here I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.710 
you can do it for all four wheels here I
only<00:03:05.620> show<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.920> them

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.090 

I went<00:03:08.930> ahead<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.320> fastened<00:03:09.770> one<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
I went ahead and fastened one of the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.250 
I went ahead and fastened one of the
wheels<00:03:10.280> onto<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> axle<00:03:10.970> we're<00:03:11.870> going<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.050> push

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
wheels onto the axle we're going to push

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.900 
wheels onto the axle we're going to push
the<00:03:12.410> axle<00:03:12.590> through<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.310> as<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.550> can<00:03:13.670> see<00:03:13.880> I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
the axle through and as you can see I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.820 
the axle through and as you can see I
made<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.450> straw<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.320> little<00:03:15.500> wider

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
made the straw so it's a little wider

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.190 
made the straw so it's a little wider
than<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.160> base<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:17.210> that<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.660> wheels<00:03:17.900> don't

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
than the base so that the wheels don't

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.020 
than the base so that the wheels don't
chafe<00:03:18.530> against<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.070> side<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.310> our<00:03:19.550> base<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
chafe against the side of our base and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.270 
chafe against the side of our base and
now<00:03:20.570> I'll<00:03:20.750> go<00:03:20.960> push<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.410> other<00:03:21.530> wheel<00:03:21.770> on<00:03:22.040> and

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
now I'll go push the other wheel on and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.950 
now I'll go push the other wheel on and
you<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.850> go<00:03:22.970> ahead<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.360> glue<00:03:23.540> both<00:03:23.720> those

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
you can go ahead and glue both those

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.710 
you can go ahead and glue both those
wheels<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.620> then<00:03:25.250> see<00:03:25.880> how<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.060> rotates

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
wheels in and then see how it rotates

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.590 
wheels in and then see how it rotates
next<00:03:27.620> comes<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.950> friction<00:03:28.370> drive<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.390> we

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
next comes the friction drive this we

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.270 
next comes the friction drive this we
will<00:03:29.750> need<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.900> motor<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.410> motor<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:30.920> you

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
will need a motor a motor like this you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.370 
will need a motor a motor like this you
can<00:03:31.400> find<00:03:31.580> amended<00:03:32.030> many<00:03:32.270> motorized<00:03:32.810> toys<00:03:33.080> or

in<00:03:37.190> my<00:03:37.220> videos<00:03:37.640> I'll<00:03:38.180> make<00:03:38.480> sure<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:38.660> leave<00:03:38.840> a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
in my videos I'll make sure I leave a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.270 
in my videos I'll make sure I leave a

now<00:03:40.610> since<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.030> axle<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.660> motor<00:03:41.780> doesn't

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
now since the axle of the motor doesn't

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.020 
now since the axle of the motor doesn't
have<00:03:42.740> enough<00:03:42.950> friction<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.370> drive<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.850> wheel

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
have enough friction to drive the wheel

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.670 
have enough friction to drive the wheel
by<00:03:44.209> itself<00:03:44.540> we're<00:03:44.990> going<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.200> need<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.500> do

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
by itself we're going to need to do

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.680 
by itself we're going to need to do
something<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.130> give<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.280> more<00:03:46.520> friction<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.630> I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
something to give it more friction so I

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.960 
something to give it more friction so I
get<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.200> battery<00:03:48.560> pack<00:03:48.770> here<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.430> also<00:03:49.760> you

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
get the battery pack here this also you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.420 
get the battery pack here this also you
can<00:03:50.060> find<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.480> my<00:03:50.570> eBay<00:03:50.870> store<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.280> can

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
can find in my eBay store and you can

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.130 
can find in my eBay store and you can
use<00:03:52.550> any<00:03:52.760> other<00:03:52.850> power<00:03:53.209> source<00:03:53.540> too<00:03:53.780> for<00:03:53.990> this

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
use any other power source too for this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.830 
use any other power source too for this
step<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:55.190> put<00:03:55.400> some<00:03:55.430> glue<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.090> axle<00:03:56.690> and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
step and I put some glue on the axle and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.350 
step and I put some glue on the axle and
then<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.470> start<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:57.920> rotate<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.490> motor<00:03:58.640> now

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
then I start to rotate the motor now

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.120 
then I start to rotate the motor now
when<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.660> motor<00:03:59.840> starts<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.350> rotate<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.770> can

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
when the motor starts to rotate I can

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.190 
when the motor starts to rotate I can
just<00:04:01.340> touch<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.850> glue<00:04:02.030> lightly<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.720> it'll

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
just touch the glue lightly and it'll

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.080 
just touch the glue lightly and it'll
smooth<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.709> glue<00:04:03.920> out<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.820> whole

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
smooth the glue out so that the whole

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.290 
smooth the glue out so that the whole
motors<00:04:05.780> axle<00:04:06.200> becomes<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.590> nice<00:04:07.000> high<00:04:08.000> friction

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
motors axle becomes a nice high friction

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.030 
motors axle becomes a nice high friction
surface<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:09.170> drive<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.530> wheel<00:04:09.680> with

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.870 

now<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.370> got<00:04:17.730> about<00:04:18.120> two<00:04:18.389> pieces<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.840> foam<00:04:19.880> 3.5

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
now I got about two pieces of foam 3.5

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.820 
now I got about two pieces of foam 3.5
centimeters<00:04:21.450> tall<00:04:21.630> by<00:04:21.810> 4<00:04:22.049> centimeters<00:04:22.620> wide

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
centimeters tall by 4 centimeters wide

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.950 
centimeters tall by 4 centimeters wide
with<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.280> notch<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.760> middle<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.540> prop<00:04:24.780> up

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
with the notch in the middle to prop up

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.060 
with the notch in the middle to prop up
the<00:04:25.320> motor<00:04:25.889> now<00:04:26.700> as<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.120> see<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.830> cut<00:04:28.830> them

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
the motor now as you can see I cut them

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.620 
the motor now as you can see I cut them
a<00:04:29.100> little<00:04:29.580> shorter<00:04:29.940> than<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> motor<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
a little shorter than the motor and

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.690 
a little shorter than the motor and
basically<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.110> want<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.410> cut<00:04:31.590> them<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.520> a

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
basically you want to cut them so that a

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.350 
basically you want to cut them so that a
straw<00:04:33.120> or<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> dowel<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:35.010> or<00:04:35.550> dowel<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.120> size

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.840 
straw or a dowel this or dowel the size
of<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.570> straw<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:37.320> fit<00:04:37.560> in<00:04:37.650> between<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.639> motor

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
of a straw can fit in between the motor

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.760 
of a straw can fit in between the motor
and<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.090> piece<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.600> styrofoam<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.530> motor

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and the piece of styrofoam and the motor

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.159 
and the piece of styrofoam and the motor
will<00:04:41.010> sit<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:42.210> same<00:04:42.510> angle<00:04:42.690> there<00:04:42.990> with

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
will sit on that same angle there with

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.300 
will sit on that same angle there with
it<00:04:43.639> now<00:04:44.639> I'm<00:04:45.120> going<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.480> cut<00:04:45.630> out<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.780> straw<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.740> 2

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
it now I'm going to cut out a straw to 2

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.900 
it now I'm going to cut out a straw to 2
small<00:04:47.669> pieces<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.330> straw<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:49.280> I'm<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.850> to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
small pieces of a straw and I'm going to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.840 
small pieces of a straw and I'm going to
glue<00:04:51.240> those<00:04:51.479> on<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.930> sides<00:04:52.200> later<00:04:52.610> but<00:04:53.610> now

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
glue those on the sides later but now

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.490 
glue those on the sides later but now
first<00:04:54.630> I'm<00:04:54.780> going<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:54.990> stick<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.260> dowel

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
first I'm going to stick the dowel

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.780 
first I'm going to stick the dowel
through<00:04:55.770> them<00:04:55.889> just<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.190> show<00:04:56.400> you<00:04:56.460> what<00:04:56.700> it

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
through them just to show you what it

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.340 
through them just to show you what it
looks<00:04:57.030> like<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:59.389> then<00:05:00.389> you<00:05:00.570> can<00:05:00.750> go<00:05:00.870> ahead<00:05:01.020> and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
looks like and then you can go ahead and

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.860 
looks like and then you can go ahead and
glue<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.010> straws<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:02.520> like<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.419> see<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
glue the straws on like that and see the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.629 
glue the straws on like that and see the
dowel<00:05:04.050> sticking<00:05:04.590> through<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.889> middle<00:05:05.190> it's

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
dowel sticking through the middle it's

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.159 
dowel sticking through the middle it's
another<00:05:05.910> dowel<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.450> found<00:05:06.750> at<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.930> dollar

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
another dowel that I found at the dollar

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.780 
another dowel that I found at the dollar
store<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.350> can<00:05:13.500> go<00:05:13.650> ahead<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:13.979> slide<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
store and you can go ahead and slide the

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.370 
store and you can go ahead and slide the
dowel<00:05:15.030> right<00:05:15.330> through<00:05:15.570> there<00:05:15.720> cut<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.050> smaller

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
dowel right through there cut a smaller

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.700 
dowel right through there cut a smaller
piece<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:17.870> stick<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:18.900> dab<00:05:19.139> of<00:05:19.169> glue<00:05:19.350> in<00:05:19.620> the

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
piece and stick a dab of glue in the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.469 
piece and stick a dab of glue in the
middle<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.280> then<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:20.940> mount<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.330> motor

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
middle and then just mount the motor

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.420 
middle and then just mount the motor
right<00:05:21.810> on<00:05:21.960> that<00:05:22.200> just<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.770> edge<00:05:22.919> of<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.190> motor

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
right on that just the edge of the motor

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.270 
right on that just the edge of the motor
so<00:05:24.090> now<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.330> motor<00:05:24.690> uses<00:05:25.620> its<00:05:25.770> own<00:05:25.919> weight<00:05:26.400> to

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
so now the motor uses its own weight to

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.200 
so now the motor uses its own weight to
determine<00:05:29.280> how<00:05:29.400> hard<00:05:29.669> it's<00:05:29.820> going<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.000> press

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
determine how hard it's going to press

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.520 
determine how hard it's going to press
against<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.600> wheel<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.870> here<00:05:34.080> we<00:05:34.229> have<00:05:34.350> it

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
against the wheel so here we have it

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.650 
against the wheel so here we have it
added<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.070> few<00:05:35.280> new<00:05:35.460> things<00:05:35.490> onto<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.180> car<00:05:36.390> if

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
added a few new things onto the car if

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.020 
added a few new things onto the car if
you<00:05:36.900> remember<00:05:37.260> before<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.890> said<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.580> cut<00:05:38.820> the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
you remember before I said I cut the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.270 
you remember before I said I cut the
base<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:39.930> too<00:05:40.110> short<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.560> styrofoam<00:05:41.070> base

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
base of it too short the styrofoam base

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.310 
base of it too short the styrofoam base
so<00:05:41.970> this<00:05:42.180> is<00:05:42.330> would<00:05:42.479> be<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.720> length<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:43.169> it's

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
so this is would be the length that it's

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.740 
so this is would be the length that it's
really<00:05:43.620> supposed<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:44.070> look<00:05:44.250> like<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:45.510> this

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
really supposed to look like and this

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.440 
really supposed to look like and this
the<00:05:45.930> length<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.260> should<00:05:46.289> cut<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.650> too<00:05:46.889> I<00:05:47.450> also

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
the length you should cut it too I also

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.320 
the length you should cut it too I also
glued<00:05:48.870> on<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.229> battery<00:05:49.590> pack<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.150> made<00:05:51.150> the

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
glued on the battery pack and made the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330 
glued on the battery pack and made the
front<00:05:51.810> wheels<00:05:52.020> exactly<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.740> same<00:05:52.919> as<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.160> made

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
front wheels exactly the same as I made

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.840 
front wheels exactly the same as I made
the<00:05:53.460> back<00:05:53.639> wheels<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:56.130> same<00:05:56.370> size<00:05:56.610> and

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
the back wheels the same size and

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.640 
the back wheels the same size and
everything<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> same<00:05:57.539> method<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.229> they<00:05:58.470> work

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
everything the same method and they work

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.450 
everything the same method and they work
exactly<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.310> same<00:06:00.050> now<00:06:01.050> if<00:06:01.410> you<00:06:01.530> take<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.280> look

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
exactly the same now if you take a look

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.310 
exactly the same now if you take a look
at<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.700> way<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:02.850> wire<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.539> I'll<00:06:03.690> attach<00:06:04.169> a

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
at the way I wire it I'll attach a

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320 
at the way I wire it I'll attach a
picture<00:06:04.650> in<00:06:04.770> a<00:06:04.830> second<00:06:05.250> but<00:06:05.760> I<00:06:05.850> just<00:06:06.030> made<00:06:06.300> a

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
picture in a second but I just made a

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.450 
picture in a second but I just made a
simple<00:06:06.630> circuit<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.380> rayed<00:06:07.950> in<00:06:08.100> between

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
simple circuit and rayed in between

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.250 
simple circuit and rayed in between
those<00:06:08.970> two<00:06:09.210> wires<00:06:09.419> that<00:06:09.600> are<00:06:09.810> unconnected

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
those two wires that are unconnected

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.469 
those two wires that are unconnected
will<00:06:10.650> be<00:06:10.740> a<00:06:10.770> switch<00:06:11.100> and<00:06:11.400> as<00:06:11.940> you<00:06:12.090> can<00:06:12.210> see<00:06:12.450> I

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
will be a switch and as you can see I

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.600 
will be a switch and as you can see I
just<00:06:12.630> have<00:06:13.050> one<00:06:13.560> wire<00:06:13.830> from<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.160> battery<00:06:14.580> to

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
just have one wire from the battery to

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.140 
just have one wire from the battery to
the<00:06:14.789> motor

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
the motor

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.570 
the motor
and<00:06:15.360> then<00:06:16.260> if<00:06:16.770> you<00:06:16.979> saw<00:06:17.160> right<00:06:17.370> there<00:06:17.550> I

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
and then if you saw right there I

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.730 
and then if you saw right there I
connected<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.210> wire<00:06:18.360> from<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.720> other<00:06:19.500> wire

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
connected the wire from the other wire

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.960 
connected the wire from the other wire
from<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.010> battery<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.490> motor<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:20.880> it

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
from the battery to the motor and it

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.629 
from the battery to the motor and it
went<00:06:21.180> forward<00:06:21.450> now<00:06:22.410> I<00:06:22.770> just<00:06:22.830> put<00:06:23.160> a<00:06:23.220> switch<00:06:23.490> in

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
went forward now I just put a switch in

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.089 
went forward now I just put a switch in
between<00:06:24.169> so<00:06:25.169> that<00:06:25.409> I<00:06:25.440> can<00:06:25.710> actually<00:06:25.860> control

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
between so that I can actually control

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.130 
between so that I can actually control
when<00:06:26.580> it<00:06:26.700> goes

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
when it goes

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.100 
when it goes
and<00:06:28.740> I'll<00:06:28.860> attach<00:06:29.010> a<00:06:29.310> picture<00:06:29.460> afterwards<00:06:30.110> of

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
and I'll attach a picture afterwards of

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.970 
and I'll attach a picture afterwards of
what<00:06:31.320> the<00:06:31.470> circuit<00:06:31.890> should<00:06:32.070> look<00:06:32.220> like

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
what the circuit should look like

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.130 
what the circuit should look like
this<00:06:34.640> here's<00:06:34.910> just<00:06:34.970> a<00:06:35.270> quick<00:06:35.480> look<00:06:35.630> at<00:06:35.810> how<00:06:35.960> its

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
this here's just a quick look at how its

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.320 
this here's just a quick look at how its
wired<00:06:39.010> so<00:06:40.010> here<00:06:40.220> you<00:06:40.400> can<00:06:40.550> see<00:06:40.730> it's<00:06:40.850> wired<00:06:41.060> the

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
wired so here you can see it's wired the

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.120 
wired so here you can see it's wired the
exact<00:06:41.660> same<00:06:41.930> way<00:06:42.110> as<00:06:42.140> in<00:06:42.380> the<00:06:42.410> diagram<00:06:42.620> before

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
exact same way as in the diagram before

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.490 
exact same way as in the diagram before
and<00:06:43.550> you<00:06:43.670> can<00:06:43.790> turn<00:06:43.940> the<00:06:44.120> switch<00:06:44.270> on<00:06:44.540> and<00:06:44.810> watch

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
and you can turn the switch on and watch

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.710 
and you can turn the switch on and watch
it<00:06:45.710> go<00:06:46.720> and<00:06:48.460> in<00:06:49.460> this<00:06:49.610> last<00:06:49.940> one<00:06:50.090> here<00:06:50.300> I<00:06:50.360> glued

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
it go and in this last one here I glued

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.510 
it go and in this last one here I glued
down<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:51.110> battery<00:06:51.470> pack<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:51.950> the<00:06:52.070> switch<00:06:52.310> so

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
down the battery pack and the switch so

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.760 
down the battery pack and the switch so
none<00:06:52.670> of<00:06:52.700> it<00:06:52.910> flails<00:06:53.180> around<00:06:53.590> so<00:06:54.590> this
