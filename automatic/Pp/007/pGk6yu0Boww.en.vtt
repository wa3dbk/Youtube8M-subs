00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.980 

rice<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> reason<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
rice is the reason that I'm here in this

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.490 
rice is the reason that I'm here in this
country<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.560> I<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:37.829> exist<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:39.500> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
country that I even exist so my the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
country that I even exist so my the
reason<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:40.920> grandparents<00:00:41.550> came<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.030> from

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
reason my grandparents came here from

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.590 
reason my grandparents came here from
India<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.900> because<00:00:43.970> my<00:00:44.970> grandfather<00:00:45.329> was

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
India is because my grandfather was

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.770 
India is because my grandfather was
doing<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> math<00:00:46.350> PhD<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.040> Rice<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.630> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
doing a math PhD at Rice and so and so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.880 
doing a math PhD at Rice and so and so
this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> first<00:00:49.230> reason<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this is the first reason I think the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
this is the first reason I think the
second<00:00:50.190> reason<00:00:50.310> is<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
second reason is that you know I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.030 
second reason is that you know I
wouldn't<00:00:51.750> even<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.560> my<00:00:52.770> parents

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
wouldn't even be here if my parents

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100 
wouldn't even be here if my parents
hadn't<00:00:53.370> met<00:00:53.489> oh<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.210> mom<00:00:54.420> went<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
hadn't met oh right so my mom went to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
hadn't met oh right so my mom went to
rice<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.649> Brown<00:00:56.010> College<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.670> father<00:00:56.910> went<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
rice and Sid rich and they met when my

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.630 
rice and Sid rich and they met when my
dad<00:01:00.690> code<00:01:01.050> advised<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.530> Brown<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.070> week<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
dad code advised at Brown for a week I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
dad code advised at Brown for a week I
was<00:01:03.149> convinced<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.840> did<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
was convinced that I did not want to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.499 
was convinced that I did not want to
apply<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.829> to<00:01:05.189> rice<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.880> wanted<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> like

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
apply it to rice at all I wanted to like

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.860 
apply it to rice at all I wanted to like
board<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.290> own<00:01:07.409> path<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.630> that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
board my own path but then I think that

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.450 
board my own path but then I think that
the<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.140> last<00:01:10.380> second<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.830> parents<00:01:11.250> forced

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the very last second my parents forced

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.250 
the very last second my parents forced
me<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> apply<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:14.580> got<00:01:15.510> in<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.900> came<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
me to apply and I got in I came to

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.899 
me to apply and I got in I came to
campus<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.610> was<00:01:17.700> just

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
campus and it was there was just

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
campus and it was there was just
something<00:01:18.120> like<00:01:18.420> about<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:19.590> being<00:01:19.830> here

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
something like about about being here

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070 
something like about about being here
and<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.900> point

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.590 
and I think it was like at that point
where<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.470> kind<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.799> understood<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.640> there

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
started research my freshman year in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.060 
started research my freshman year in
Jeff<00:01:46.220> Taber's<00:01:46.580> lab<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:48.050> so<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.680> had<00:01:48.920> done<00:01:49.040> a

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.500 
Jeff Taber's lab and so I had done a
little<00:01:49.370> bit<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.610> research<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.090> high<00:01:50.210> school

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510

papers<00:02:03.220> go<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.280> conferences<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.300> think

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
papers go to conferences and I think

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.020

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
started in the lab and I feel like

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.520 
started in the lab and I feel like
that's<00:02:23.180> opened<00:02:23.600> up<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.840> lot<00:02:23.990> of<00:02:24.140> different
