 stress we are in a new video that today 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.799
 we are with the titan the super mega ultra 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.849
 hyper plane this super mega huge that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.920
 at the moment it is the biggest that there is in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.620
 gta iv I have come to bring you how to open 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.199
 The title lasts a series of challenges 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 which I want you to help me 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250

 comments is to say let's do it from 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 so you leave me in the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.369
 comments for example make a challenge of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.449
 a car that does not crash that des all 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.550
 the return to the map of people like that in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.590
 crash then if that if that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 comment has of x votes 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.570
 positive is the one that has more then I will do 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 that challenge I would like you to help between 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.700
 everyone is worth it because I do not want them to be 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 many challenges I want to be few but 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.789
 that are well thought out and that are 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 voted is that we help each other 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.750
 all to take out a challenge that is very 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 fun and what can be done and what 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.469
 I'm actually going to try to do 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.559
 one that is the typical challenge of parking the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.690
 titan on top of the most bank but I do not 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.730
 I'm going to get it because I'm a mega manco 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.860
 and because I know there is a trick to achieve it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.280
 to achieve the macho that I do not get for 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.200
 and I do not know in unknown is the trick like that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.970
 let's see if it comes out but I already 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.190
 I say to you that it will not come out because 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.660
 I will not leave because I do not know it 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.850
 I think the trick is to go like that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.650
 of cool and in reducing the speed 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.360
 when you raise the month bank but let's go 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.440
 I believe it no no no no no how do you see I am 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.600
 very bad I am very lame with planes 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.550
 I drown here my mother like a bank 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.440
 with the planes but good if I wanted 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.729
 be the series of challenges preferably 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.800
 that is of motorcycles and cars because with the 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.810
 airplanes as you see I am a lover to the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.310
 total a pack of people but good 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.479
 you can also try something is not the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.920
 time that I will throw myself to do the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.750
 challenges I will not do daily 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.670
 I will also tell you that it will be in 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.560
 plan when a challenge comes up that is 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.270
 really cool because I'll review the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.369
 video from time to time to see the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.100
 comments and such and I will see the challenges that 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.930
 you have proposed to me and I will try in fact 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 well that meet meet those challenges 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.619
 and well I say that they have to be 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.940
 very cool they have to be voted as 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.509
 minimum has to have three votes 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.520
 positives 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.750
 I imagine that later they will have more but as 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.790
 minimum I want you to have those three for 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.989
 be able to choose the and such and always 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.050
 be cool and that I like and for 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.330
 example of making a 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.070
 without hitting the one that I have that is a 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.960
 22- kilometer race without hitting the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.210
 ens can be difficult or make a 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.490
 race of let's say that gta with 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.230
 subscribers and do not burst that 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.480
 it can also be chungo directly 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.340
 with stratus because that would already be the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.570
 final challenge I do not want to be deals 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.010
 conventional ok I do not want the typical 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.870
 challenge goes under the bridge 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.100
 doing an inverted looping with a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.050
 motorcycle no no no I do not want it to be the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.030
 typical challenge that I challenge myself to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 typical challenge of stunt no no no no no that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.480
 I do not want it to be I want it to be a challenge 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 You say mother, this is fucking 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.410
 impossible but I think that flow can 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.730
 achieve why why yes because no 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.500
 you can get it because it's a very eagle 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.540
 nice and because you can get any 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.800
 kind of things that are proposed gta well 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.820
