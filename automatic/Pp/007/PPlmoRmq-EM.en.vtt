people<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.740> kick<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.280> because

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
people get like a kick out of it because

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
people get like a kick out of it because
it<00:02:05.940> introduces<00:02:06.569> civilians<00:02:07.409> into<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> level

by single-player rules and stick which
is<00:02:57.190> great<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:58.570> lets<00:02:58.780> them<00:02:58.959> flex

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
is great but it just lets them flex

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.960 
is great but it just lets them flex
their<00:02:59.560> designer<00:02:59.920> muscles<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:00.700> not<00:03:00.910> just

really awesome surprises for the players
out<00:03:06.400> there<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.880> spec<00:03:07.330> up<00:03:07.480> somewhat<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.840> think

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
out there and spec up somewhat I think

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.660 
out there and spec up somewhat I think
are<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.470> completely<00:03:08.680> unique<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.489> call

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
are just completely unique to the call

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.110 
are just completely unique to the call
of<00:03:09.700> duty<00:03:09.790> game<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:11.800> far<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.070> DLC<00:03:12.489> goes<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.940> does

of duty game as far as DLC goes it does

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.690 
of duty game as far as DLC goes it does
seem<00:03:13.420> logical<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.220> spec<00:03:15.220> off<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.580> just

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
seem logical that spec off is just

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.470 
seem logical that spec off is just
perfect<00:03:16.180> for<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.360> type<00:03:16.570> of<00:03:16.600> stuff<00:03:18.480> modern
