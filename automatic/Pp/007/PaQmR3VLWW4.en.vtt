00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.580
 he is again declared that is now 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.469
 second video to the lenovo so in the next 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.100
 video come the classic old ones 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.379
 videos again and as always that 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.390
 altenburger leash monthly imagine 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.080
 but the cards are of course as usual 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.789
 also said identical in every brave one 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.590
 sometimes has a difference that the sense 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.670
 the device shows or the other 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.619
 there are such clouds in the clouds 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.600
 Differences also in the person grad 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.340
 with the views but otherwise 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.839
 the cards are basically always 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.760
 go on and on with the house 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.870
 Of course that's one of the simple ones 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.170
 cards you can really great 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.420
 note the house represents the place of residence 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.339
 of course also apartment and similar 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.649
 yes, even if someone in the student dorm 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.969
 lives then the house is still there where 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.679
 he lives the house but also gets up 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.079
 a second level for the reason 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.129
 the man stands the solid in the base 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.539
 live everything that is fixed for 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.729
 For example, if the house is next to the heart 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.049
 Of course, this is also possible with flats 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.329
 stories have to do with mine 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.250
 relationship together or similar in 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.140
 But first you would interpret it like that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.850
 that 's a solid relationship that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.759
 it solid then builds together 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.689
 So what's the bottom line? 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.310
 of the house and yes, if someone what now 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.930
 plan house building or similar is 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.820
 Of course, great if the card shows up 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.009
 there is always a special meaning 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.810
 together with the storks then means 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.020
 the house namely a move then one becomes 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.890
 wing and move on 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.619
 otherwise always the immediate ones 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.570
 consider cards when looking closer to 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.789
 living situation would like to know if move 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.289
 is planned is always quite a 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.689
 important map on the current topic 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.700
 Wohnungsnot the people a flat 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.920
 search and unfortunately not find so that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.009
 house is always there the central map 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 After that, look at the topics 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.090
 tree is similar in style 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.939
 house rather for solid things 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.710
 but the tree needs time yes that 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.810
 but the map of life the life tree 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.640
 so to speak 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.700
 but it is also the map of the slow 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.050
 growth east 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.819
 small seedlings once so huge 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.730
 tree will take a long time 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.340
 without it , it's also the things 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.870
 sometimes too slow to happen 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.170
 Slowly it's a bit too 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.640
 sometimes boring card if so 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.230
 one was quick to wish then he is 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.330
 certainly not the map you see 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.239
 wants the undertone already positive 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 is the undertone is always it is solid 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.580
 it grows in the long run 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.989
 So successful only nothing is 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.250
 fast starts stories but 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.379
 really for the stuff you can do for a long time 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.090
 plans and who the cards in 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.890
 health issues questioned 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.510
 for the tree is one too 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.180
 interesting card there it is the card 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.099
 Of course, health always 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.680
 So the doctor has to be told 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.910
 the healing practitioner and similar people 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.860
 are then the suitable ones 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.989
 Contact person as necessarily the cards 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.110
 sometimes you can do things with the cards 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.000
 in terms of health or say 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.120
 my things already well 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.849
 clarify but it happens that so many 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.700
 Unfortunately, things still are where 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.989
 people then important interventions in santa 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.790
 Never move or 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.100
 similar that I can only advise against 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.090
 so really with professionals 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.069
 clarify 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.319
 the cards are great and still 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.859
 maybe the emotional level too 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.840
 clarify 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.980
 but it is certainly nothing 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.840
 medical advice can or should replace 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.220
 yes we come to the clouds and the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.620
 Clouds are a bit of a problem 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.450
 cards yes that are train to come while you 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.069
 always have to look the bright side of the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.940
 clouds like that refers to things 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.350
 are unclear 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.420
 yes I always say they are like in the 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.829
 mist shrouded you may see 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.530
 a bit but what really needs something 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.190
 not really yet and the dark one 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.180
 side of the wanted that's the side where 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.829
 where are those only cares 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.480
 Thunderclouds coming marching 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.910
 so you have to look at the cards 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.739
 what next to it is left or right the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.989
 are each affected by the cloud 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.419
 only the old burg country is one 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.010
 bit special here, it is difficult 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.840
 the direction to determine more clouds 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.400
 in many dax that is then in the middle 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 so that's one side of the page 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.590
 color has and the other side the color 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.510
 there is 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.389
 Today I personally do it here 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.919
 Remember that the bright cloud is in this 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.370
 obviously blown direction 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.229
 becomes 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.350
 so that's the bright side and then 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.000
 that here the dark but as I said at 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.010
 the other decks it is clearer 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.060
 if you are at the very beginning and 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.320
 you say no rhyme thereon 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.960
 You could have done that too 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.639
 mark or similar cards are yes 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.580
 also work equipment and you can go to the 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.160
 for example , a proper working day 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.870
 make that you really only take you 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.910
 I do not think the cards cost now 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.280
 absolutely the world and there you can 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.660
 also meanings on it or 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.700
 Just make marks and 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.620
 similar that is not a problem and it 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.419
 Helps learn a lot if you have one 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.950
 a bit on flea markets are on the way 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.979
 and old card game discovers the 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.350
 apparently also to the oracle were used 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.320
 then you often see that too 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.120
 then all this old handwriting 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.010
 fine feather note on it made 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.210
 So there we are not the first and 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.280
 will not be the last one yet 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.260
 do that and for many it is 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.600
 I can really learn a good help 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.800
 So only recommend 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.510
 from the next video then again 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.160
 old countries around videos i wish you 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.419
 have fun with it and I'm happy too 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.419
 that I bring back now
