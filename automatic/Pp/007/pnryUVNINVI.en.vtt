00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
definitely can see the lines making it

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.300

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
you a look at him and this is not the

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.850 
you a look at him and this is not the
first<00:05:50.620> time<00:05:50.919> for<00:05:51.190> him<00:05:51.520> either<00:05:51.900> back<00:05:52.900> in<00:05:53.169> 2013

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
first time for him either back in 2013

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.969 
first time for him either back in 2013
he<00:05:54.520> was<00:05:54.700> included<00:05:55.300> as<00:05:55.479> part<00:05:55.510> of<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.470> holiday

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
he was included as part of the holiday

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.630 
he was included as part of the holiday
series<00:05:58.380> both<00:05:59.380> have<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.650> white<00:05:59.830> chassis<00:06:00.340> both

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
series both have a white chassis both

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.659 
series both have a white chassis both
the<00:06:00.850> graphics<00:06:01.570> are<00:06:01.830> practically<00:06:02.830> exactly<00:06:03.520> the

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
the graphics are practically exactly the

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.640 
the graphics are practically exactly the
same<00:06:04.000> so<00:06:04.780> if<00:06:04.960> you<00:06:05.080> have<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.350> older<00:06:05.620> version

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
same so if you have the older version

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.980 
same so if you have the older version
and<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.580> might<00:06:06.760> not<00:06:06.910> necessarily<00:06:07.090> need<00:06:07.780> to

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
and you might not necessarily need to

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.050 
and you might not necessarily need to
pick<00:06:08.200> up<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.500> newer<00:06:08.680> version

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.670 

so<00:06:13.060> in<00:06:13.150> case<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.390> guy<00:06:13.720> confusing<00:06:14.290> Mohawk

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
so in case that guy confusing Mohawk

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.800 
so in case that guy confusing Mohawk
warrior<00:06:15.040> looks<00:06:15.580> practically<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.330> same<00:06:16.540> as

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
warrior looks practically the same as

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.130 
warrior looks practically the same as
