00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.860
 because of a lingering cannula 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.200
 before the life of a lingering cannula 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.250
 should have the required materials 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.510
 ready to be laid 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.020
 These include a jam hose 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 disinfectant 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 copper and gloves 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.600
 the refuse oils with mandate to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.410
 close 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.970
 simply because no plaster 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.140
 as well as a discharge container 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.670
 after putting on the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.850
 Examination gloves will be the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.400
 hose on the upper arm about 5 cm above the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.990
 Arm bend applied when the veins go through 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.210
 the congestion is not well visible 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.650
 the patient can be asked the hand 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.380
 repeatedly to close the fist 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.760
 This improves the filling 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.130
 and the subsequent function 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.080
 relieved by the inspection and 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.560
 The passion of the poor becomes one 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.120
 zoom function suitable vein visited 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.350
 Frequent functional locations are the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.129
 elle bow 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.129
 forearm 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.840
 like the back of the hand 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.609
 The function is especially easy there 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.250
 where veins are formed 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.909
 since here a roll of the vessel is not 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 is possible 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.189
 very often there is one 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.990
 branch in the field of tobacco 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.479
 therefore a popular function 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.459
 represents is a suitable vein 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.329
 found disinfection of the 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.969
 puncture spot 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.530
 this is the disinfectant 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.520
 either sprayed on or with a 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.439
 applied swab 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.969
 regarding the contact time of the skin 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.469
 antiseptics it is the 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.329
 manufacturer information to be observed 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.250
 For sebaceous glands poor skin like 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.469
 for example in the ellenbeuge or on the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.569
 the back of the hand is the contact time in 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.270
 usually at least 15 seconds 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.009
 In addition, in principle, special 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.659
 hygienic regulations of the institution 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.179
 to be observed in the intervention 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 will be followed for the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.220
 function needed materials 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.350
 ready to hand 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 then the wings become the mill 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.310
 slightly bent down and the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.840
 Protective cap of the functional needle will 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.629
 away 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.160
 the needle acts as one of their three 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.260
 futility within the catheter 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.239
 should be checked before coming in one 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.450
 angle of about 30 degrees through the skin 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.940
 is stung 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.739
 The skin should be above the functional 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.080
 stand with the not honorable hand 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.420
 be fixed in order to roll away the vein 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.099
 to prevent 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.020
 The dotted hand can be used for 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.580
 additional tension of the skin of the part 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.580
 the function point be launched 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.099
 the skin is pierced 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.580
 angle slightly flattened and the vein 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.580
 Dots 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.730
 is the function of filling few lungs 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.920
 the cone is at the end of the administrators 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.080
 mill with blood 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.959
 but it is only clear that first 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.849
 the needle would lie in the vein 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.349
 Now pull back the needle and the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.599
 coated plastic catheter 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.650
 could advance this in addition to the 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.650
 to come to rest 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.810
 Therefore, the administration mill should still 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.549
 some are advanced millimeter to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.420
 make sure that also the 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.209
 Plastic catheter is located in the vein 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.930
 only then the needle is allowed about 1 cm 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.540
 be withdrawn 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.739
 The jam hose can now open and 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.629
 who refuse without the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.370
 withdrawn needle still to 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.290
 stabilization of the plastic catheter 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.290
 serves to be advanced 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.060
 safer but more technically difficult 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.250
 is a procedure where the needle is not 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.930
 is withdrawn 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.130
 instead, the needle is fixed and 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.580
 only the envelope of the catheter 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.620
 advanced 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.010
 the risk of the desired function 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.260
 losing a sword is lower here 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.939
 this procedure is therefore generally for 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.790
 lay of catheters over a mantra 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.560
 system to recommend for example too 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.299
 When placing an arterial administrator 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.299
 mill or at a puncture 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.359
 after successful positioning of the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.709
 denied offenders will be under the 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.510
 Injectors a small arrow 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.310
 Avoid placing pressure points 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.260
 should 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.300
 this one will often manage with that 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.200
 plaster with delivered which afterwards 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.200
 can be glued on 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.900
 The plastic wings of the Verwal channels 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.430
 should only by the two 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.469
 legs of the plaster are fixed 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.980
 while the end is free for injections 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.720
 remains 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.550
 around soiling by drops of blood 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.500
 when removing the metallic needle 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.420
 to prevent it from the cannula 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.950
 to a swab below the 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.470
 place cannula opening 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.180
 The needle can now be pulled out and 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.840
 The lumen of the cannula through an andra 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.840
 be closed 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.400
 Finally, the functional needle in 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.860
 a designated release to 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.409
 to dispose 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.819
 when the distance should be drawn 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.979
 first the plaster should be moistened 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.520
 to gently detach from the skin 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.520
 to facilitate 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.350
 then catheters are inserted 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.630
 plaster removed together 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.160
 this can be a swab in the area of 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.690
 function points are placed and 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.139
 blood splatter when pulling out too 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.300
 avoid 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.919
 Finally, the swab on the 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.330
 function and then press 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.330
 be fixed to a strip of adhesive
