00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.200
 very good friends I am to pull 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.000
 let's forget and we are in the stand of 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.040
 lenovo to perform our first 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.930
 making contact with the bieber wolf are 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.269
 the reference smartphone of the company 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.130
 that is focused on photography with a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.920
 16 megapixel sensor and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.630
 optical stabilization 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.580
 the body of the alive now is 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.320
 completely made of aluminum and the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.390
 front and rear covered by the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.880
 crystal what gives a very rewarding touch 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.130
 front is completely black and the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.680
 buttons we found right below being 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 capacitive there are several points in this 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.220
 design that we value very positively 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.070
 In addition to the construction quality of the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.350
 set and the materials used the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.059
 situation of the two speakers is one of 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.190
 those details and he appreciates that they are 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.280
 at the base of the device just one to 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.960
 each side of the microusb connector with this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.370
 with such a flat design we avoid the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.140
 sealing of the sound that would have 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.540
 produced safe when placed in the part 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 of res age another of the points that more 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.140
 we like it is the integration of 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.370
 dedicated buttons for the camera the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.470
 device is available in three 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.629
 black and white colors with the body 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.129
 metallic in the natural color of the metal and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.890
 black with metallic body in red 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.570
 the latter highlights both the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.280
 design as the specifications are 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.080
 designed for photography to take 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.940
 the most relevant role of the GDP that still 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.350
 so lenovo has opted in this case for not 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.290
 attract base numbers or designs 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.660
 devices for the camera 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.340
 the sensor is 16 megapixels with 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.170
 optical stabilization and autofocus on 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.420
 laser as we found in devices 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.030
 like the lg 3 and that improves the speed 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.470
 of focus we also have a triple 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 led flash with three color tones 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.580
 different to improve the tonality 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.820
 end of the photos taken 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.560
 by the characteristics of the sensor 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.170
 we assume that we can be before the sony 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.240
 and mx2 14 that is already used in the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.070
 samsung galaxy on 4 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.290
 being a sensor quite similar to 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.180
 we channel for galaxy 14 we do not doubt 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.520
 in the results they will be very good 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.509
 with this videos or in the photos taken and 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.619
 that we have made during the 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.840
 limited tests that we have been able 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.390
 perform here we have found that the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.250
 quality of them is very good 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.320
 colors represented are realistic and the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.670
 amount of detail is pretty good from 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.500
 Anyway, it's not about any 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.179
 revolution if they think is more 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 concentrated the camera these same 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.959
 results we can get to others 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.819
 smartphones optical stabilization 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.170
 image with a very important role to the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.480
 time to take pictures with low lighting 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.519
 allows us more exposure times 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.489
 lengths that allow you to capture more light without 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.380
 blurry images produced this 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.230
 sensor is capable of performing hd recording 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.209
 that are 2,160 despite temptations for 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.790
 second or we also have full hd's 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.560
 1080p at 30 3 per second in this 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.030
 we are very grateful to be able to tell 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.840
 with optical stabilization that improves 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.580
 very much the quality of the video taken 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.739
 we talk about the screen we are facing a 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.769
 good size panel are 5 inches of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.080
 ips type and we have the resolution of 1920 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.530
 x 1080 pixels with what we get 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.790
 a density of 441 dots per inch 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.830
 it seems to us a resolution that really 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.299
 successful and we believe that in this case 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.190
 it is necessary to bet on resolutions 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.470
 older especially considering the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 results that this screen gives 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.550
 the colors are vivid is contrasting is 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.470
 very tall and the representation of colors 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.850
 it is successful highlighting a very black 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.290
 deep 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.790
 we are facing a very good screen in 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.800
 general in which we could not see 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.840
 no noticeable deficiency the brightness 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.670
 It is also high, which will facilitate its use 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.530
 outdoors and viewing angles 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.150
 They are quite broad 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.280
 the processor although it is not the most 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.380
 powerful will provide us with a good 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.240
 ibex functionality now we have the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.720
 intermediate processor within current 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.280
 with that it's about 615 legislators from 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.560
 eight cores that do not work 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.209
 simultaneously this processor divides 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.270
 his eight in cores based on cuts to 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.370
 53 in two blocks a block in which 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.770
 work at 1.7 gigahertz and on the other 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.239
 block will work to a gigahertz 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.630
 this processor is located somewhat below 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.980
 of the mediatek mt 6 592 processor that 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.870
 it still has enough processors for 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.000
 on top of which we are facing a 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.860
 intermediate power but yes that we 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.570
 will allow everything to run smoothly 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.450
 except for certain games more 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.190
 powerful 64 bits of this processor 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.959
 be taken advantage of by android 502 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.660
 lollipop with which he is thrown to 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.319
 market the viewfinder this is nothing 2 615 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.030
 comes next to a gpu adreno 405 and with 3 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.680
 gigas of ram this is going to be more than 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.569
 enough so that it does not weigh any 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.700
 moment to the execution of various 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.780
 simultaneous applications and we do not have 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.669
 some problem in the use of 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.700
 multitasking in terms of storage 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.550
 internal is 32 gigabytes but we can 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.639
 expand it using microsd cards 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.440
 at 128 gb the battery is 2 thousand 900 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.520
 milliamps and it's not removable so 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.069
 that we hope to get a good 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.000
 autonomy so you do not need to be able to charge 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.400
 the phone in 1 or 2 days 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.290
 as we have commented previously this 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.330
 you live or you go to the market with andres 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.040
 502 lollipop and with personalization 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.770
 own company based on the 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.360
 vibe 2.0 interface where it is not 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.730
 complicated to see certain similarities with 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.860
 the test of them as almost always the 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.270
 Chinese customizations we lose the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.560
 application drawer and all are 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.170
 organize through the different 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.580
 desks both the icons the 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.830
 folders created or the bar 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.480
 notifications and energy control not 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.710
 we can stop seeing the similarities with 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.570
 they of which we have been 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.740
 speaking the customization is pretty 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.510
 wide and we have the possibility of 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.610
 change entire topics or modify by 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.620
 separate animations wallpapers 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.180
 or icons we also have control by 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.710
 gestures 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.990
 that was less passed by are of 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.729
 Lenovo and check the full range with 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.250
 which will be launched in 2015 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.050
 we hope that a large part of them 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.490
 they come here to the European market because 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.320
 as you know the range of last year that 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.050
 It was also very interesting, it was not arrived 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.310
 to throw out of his native country with 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.050
 friends up here comes our first 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.610
 make contact with this the new kid 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.500
 shot you know if you liked this 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.240
 video give a like subscribe to our 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.860
 channel if you have not done it yet and we 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.860
 we see very soon here in holguin moss
