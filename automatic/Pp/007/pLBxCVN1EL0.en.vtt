00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
me think it was the dub was done by a

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.020 
me think it was the dub was done by a
Japanese<00:02:49.870> guy<00:02:50.080> trying<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.739> speak<00:02:50.980> English<00:02:51.370> and

Japanese guy trying to speak English and
it<00:02:52.180> kind<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.450> ruins<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.780> mood<00:02:52.959> sometimes<00:02:53.430> some

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it kind of ruins the mood sometimes some

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.619 
it kind of ruins the mood sometimes some
of<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.640> characters<00:02:54.970> voices<00:02:55.150> are<00:02:55.420> just

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
of the characters voices are just

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.630 
of the characters voices are just
downright<00:02:55.870> annoying<00:02:59.250> some<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.430> just

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
downright annoying some of them just

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.710 
downright annoying some of them just

some of them even add on to it look a

some of them even add on to it look a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
little more such as having an ability to

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.410 
little more such as having an ability to
charge<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.920> attacking<00:03:21.220> remove<00:03:21.640> plus<00:03:22.239> if<00:03:22.390> we

charge the attacking remove plus if we

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.390 
charge the attacking remove plus if we
appear<00:03:23.170> within<00:03:23.349> close<00:03:23.650> range<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.160> also

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
appear within close range you can also

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.789 
appear within close range you can also
do<00:03:24.700> like<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.910> physical<00:03:25.360> attack<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.560> means

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
do like a physical attack and that means

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.229 
do like a physical attack and that means
they<00:03:26.890> can<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.130> like<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.340> max<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.730> four<00:03:27.940> moves

they can have like a max of four moves
not<00:03:28.510> including<00:03:28.870> their<00:03:29.019> physical<00:03:29.379> attacks

not including their physical attacks

we'll wait what other game had many

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.160 
we'll wait what other game had many

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
different types of characters that can

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.460

only have a max of four moves whatever I
must<00:03:42.099> say<00:03:42.250> though<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:43.120> gameplay<00:03:43.510> can<00:03:43.690> get

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
must say though the gameplay can get

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.420 
must say though the gameplay can get
addicting<00:03:44.349> at<00:03:44.440> times<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.160> do<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.310> run

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
addicting at times all you do is run

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.920 
addicting at times all you do is run
around<00:03:45.640> attacking<00:03:46.060> enemies<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.629> various

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
locked on your target it's kind of weird

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.650 
locked on your target it's kind of weird
but<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:58.660> still<00:03:58.900> really<00:03:59.139> fun<00:04:00.510> some<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.599> the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
but it's still really fun some of the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.390 
but it's still really fun some of the
Borg's<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.049> this<00:04:02.139> game<00:04:02.349> I<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.769> can't<00:04:02.980> use<00:04:03.250> at

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
Borg's in this game I just can't use at

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.930 
Borg's in this game I just can't use at
all<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.880> some<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.329> just<00:04:04.569> love<00:04:04.840> using<00:04:05.170> and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
all and some I just love using and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.979 
all and some I just love using and
that's<00:04:06.940> one<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.269> reasons<00:04:07.510> why<00:04:07.599> things<00:04:07.690> be

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
that's one of the reasons why things be

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.660 
that's one of the reasons why things be
so<00:04:08.200> good<00:04:08.380> online<00:04:08.500> because<00:04:09.069> some<00:04:09.340> people<00:04:09.639> have

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
so good online because some people have

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.190 
so good online because some people have
different<00:04:10.030> strategies<00:04:10.480> using<00:04:10.750> some<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.079> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
different strategies using some of the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.500 
different strategies using some of the
robots<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.889> i'll<00:04:12.549> have<00:04:12.669> my<00:04:12.880> strategy<00:04:13.329> using

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
robots and i'll have my strategy using

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.539 
robots and i'll have my strategy using
some<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> samurais<00:04:14.319> or<00:04:14.500> something<00:04:14.859> and

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
some of the samurais or something and

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.159 
some of the samurais or something and
that's<00:04:15.730> why<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:15.940> think<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.389> game<00:04:16.570> be<00:04:16.780> perfect

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
that's why I think this game be perfect

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.080 
that's why I think this game be perfect
for<00:04:17.320> online<00:04:17.739> certain<00:04:18.130> people<00:04:18.370> master<00:04:18.789> certain

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
for online certain people master certain

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.050 
for online certain people master certain
borges<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.630> everything<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:21.459> also<00:04:21.669> like<00:04:21.940> how

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
borges and everything it's also like how

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.370 
borges and everything it's also like how
to<00:04:22.120> lost<00:04:22.300> strategy<00:04:22.810> because<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.260> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
to lost strategy because you have to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.409 
to lost strategy because you have to
choose<00:04:23.620> your<00:04:23.740> team<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.280> use<00:04:24.729> a<00:04:24.760> set<00:04:25.090> amount<00:04:25.180> of

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
choose your team and use a set amount of

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.760 
choose your team and use a set amount of
points<00:04:25.630> because<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.110> better<00:04:26.289> units<00:04:26.620> are

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
points because the better units are

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.870 
points because the better units are
worth<00:04:26.889> a<00:04:27.039> lot<00:04:27.070> more<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.940> some<00:04:28.150> cases

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.590 

story<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:37.550> must<00:04:38.550> say<00:04:38.759> the<00:04:38.970> story<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.389> quite

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
story I must say the story is quite

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.719 
story I must say the story is quite
generic<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.650> with<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.889> lack<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.100> cutscenes

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
generic and with the lack of cutscenes

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.490 
generic and with the lack of cutscenes
it's<00:04:42.060> not<00:04:42.270> really<00:04:42.570> much<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.960> story<00:04:43.199> mode

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
it's not really much of a story mode

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.010
