if you're going to use sensors
industrial<00:00:07.110> sensors<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:07.740> good<00:00:07.920> idea<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.220> get

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
industrial sensors it's good idea to get

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.910 
industrial sensors it's good idea to get
familiar<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.030> sensor<00:00:09.450> before<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.650> use

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
familiar with the sensor before you use

the bottom and there's a light that

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.420 
the bottom and there's a light that
shows<00:00:31.350> you<00:00:31.500> when<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> sensor<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.369> I'll

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
shows you when the sensor is on and I'll

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.209 
shows you when the sensor is on and I'll
show<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.790> second<00:00:33.180> how<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.450> works<00:00:34.219> also

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
show you in a second how that works also

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.119 
show you in a second how that works also
there's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:37.079> diagram<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.589> that<00:00:37.829> shows

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
there's a little diagram here that shows

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
there's a little diagram here that shows
you<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> hook<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.760> up<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.210> apply<00:00:40.170> your

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you how to hook it up so you apply your

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.180 
you how to hook it up so you apply your
positive<00:00:41.749> voltage<00:00:42.749> to<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.859> positive<00:00:46.859> input

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
positive voltage to the positive input

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.560 
positive voltage to the positive input
of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> sensor<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:47.879> I'll<00:00:48.120> tell<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
of the sensor and I'll tell you in a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
of the sensor and I'll tell you in a
minute<00:00:48.659> what<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.319> because<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.949> doesn't

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
minute what that is because this doesn't

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
minute what that is because this doesn't
really<00:00:50.429> tell<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.239> anything<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
really tell you anything about the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
really tell you anything about the
color-coding<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.269> your<00:00:54.890> load<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> thing

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
color-coding and your load or the thing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.849 
color-coding and your load or the thing
that<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.760> sensor<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.089> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.390> hooked<00:00:57.659> to

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
that the sensor is going to be hooked to

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.880 
that the sensor is going to be hooked to
it<00:00:58.859> could<00:00:59.069> be<00:00:59.219> a<00:01:00.739> sync<00:01:01.739> syncing<00:01:02.519> input<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it could be a sync syncing input is the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
it could be a sync syncing input is the
little<00:01:05.159> symbol<00:01:05.550> there<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> square

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
little symbol there with the square

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
little symbol there with the square
symbol<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> slash<00:01:07.050> through<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> then

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
symbol with a slash through it and then

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
symbol with a slash through it and then
your<00:01:08.370> negative<00:01:08.759> goes<00:01:08.969> to<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.240> bottom

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
your negative goes to the bottom

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.830 
your negative goes to the bottom
terminal<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> sensor<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> color

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
terminal of the sensor now the color

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
terminal of the sensor now the color
coding<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> sensor<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:15.649> your<00:01:16.649> it's<00:01:17.579> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
coding for the sensor is your it's a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
coding for the sensor is your it's a
little<00:01:17.880> unconventional<00:01:18.200> compared<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> other

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
little unconventional compared to other

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.490 
little unconventional compared to other
things<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.920> electronics<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.259> sensors<00:01:22.259> our

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
things in electronics but in sensors our

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.080 
things in electronics but in sensors our
Brown<00:01:23.039> wire<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.789> our<00:01:24.630> positive<00:01:24.990> our<00:01:25.820> blue<00:01:26.820> wire

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
Brown wire is our positive our blue wire

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
Brown wire is our positive our blue wire
is<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.719> negative<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.549> our<00:01:30.049> output<00:01:31.049> signal<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
is the negative and our output signal is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.779 
is the negative and our output signal is
the<00:01:32.759> black<00:01:32.969> wire<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.579> tell

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
the black wire so one way to just tell

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.880 
the black wire so one way to just tell
what's<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.719> sensor<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> get

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
what's going on with the sensor and get

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.319 
what's going on with the sensor and get
familiar<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> hook<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.969> up<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
familiar with it's just to hook it up to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
familiar with it's just to hook it up to
a<00:01:39.359> 9-volt<00:01:39.780> battery<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.859> sensors<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:41.369> work

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a 9-volt battery some sensors will work

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
a 9-volt battery some sensors will work
well<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.240> others<00:01:42.930> won't<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.680> if

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
well with this and others won't so if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.770 
well with this and others won't so if
that<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:44.939> any<00:01:45.090> response<00:01:45.570> from

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that you don't get any response from

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.109 
that you don't get any response from
nine<00:01:46.229> volts<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.799> you'll<00:01:47.549> probably<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.969> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
nine volts then you'll probably have to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.950 
nine volts then you'll probably have to
use<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.450> 24<00:01:48.840> volt<00:01:48.869> power<00:01:49.200> supply<00:01:49.469> or<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:51.210> voltage

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
use a 24 volt power supply or a voltage

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.169 
use a 24 volt power supply or a voltage
is<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.350> appropriate<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:53.039> sensor<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
is more appropriate for the sensor so

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.120 
is more appropriate for the sensor so
I'm<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.719> hook<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.679> ground

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
I'm going to hook this up the ground

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.800 
I'm going to hook this up the ground
terminal<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.359> positive

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
terminal is going to the positive

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.489 
terminal is going to the positive
terminal<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.030> the<00:02:00.030> blue<00:02:00.719> terminal<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.289> going

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
terminal and the blue terminal is going

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.739 
terminal and the blue terminal is going
to<00:02:01.619> negative<00:02:01.939> now<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.179> I<00:02:03.210> should<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.539> able<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
to negative now what I should be able to

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.630 
to negative now what I should be able to
do<00:02:03.929> is<00:02:04.759> get<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.979> sensor<00:02:07.979> light<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> come<00:02:08.460> on

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
do is get the sensor light to come on

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.780 
do is get the sensor light to come on
when<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.210> it<00:02:09.330> close<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.750> an<00:02:09.869> object<00:02:10.320> as<00:02:10.860> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
when I get it close to an object as you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
when I get it close to an object as you
can<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.240> down<00:02:12.420> below

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.150 

okay<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:15.989> all<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.530> indicator<00:02:16.920> light<00:02:17.129> is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
okay now all that indicator light is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.559 
okay now all that indicator light is
telling<00:02:17.550> us<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.970> sensor<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
telling us is that the sensor is

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.210 
telling us is that the sensor is
actually<00:02:19.160> actuated<00:02:22.250> now<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:25.220> signal

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
actually actuated now to get the signal

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.670 
actually actuated now to get the signal
out<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.330> black<00:02:27.720> wire<00:02:28.019> we've<00:02:28.319> got<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> hook

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
out of the black wire we've got to hook

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
out of the black wire we've got to hook
it<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> certain<00:02:29.160> way<00:02:29.310> since<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.420> PNP

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it up a certain way since this is a PNP

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.040 
it up a certain way since this is a PNP
sensor<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.870> output<00:02:34.319> has<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:35.840> between<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
sensor the output has to be between the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.290 
sensor the output has to be between the
black<00:02:37.319> wire<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.620> ground<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.150> is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
black wire and ground because this is

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.140 
black wire and ground because this is
what<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:39.569> call<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> sourcing<00:02:40.349> sensor<00:02:41.150> sourcing

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
what we call a sourcing sensor sourcing

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.440 
what we call a sourcing sensor sourcing
means<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.690> when<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.730> sensor<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.760> activated

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
means that when the sensor is activated

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.300 
means that when the sensor is activated
and<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.620> right<00:02:46.799> now<00:02:46.980> because<00:02:47.130> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and you see it's on right now because of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.120 
and you see it's on right now because of
my<00:02:47.340> my<00:02:47.880> hand<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.390> sensing<00:02:48.720> my<00:02:48.840> hand<00:02:49.130> but

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
my my hand it's sensing my hand but

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.979 
my my hand it's sensing my hand but
sourcing<00:02:50.670> means<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.150> when<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> sensor<00:02:51.959> is

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
sourcing means that when the sensor is

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.600 
sourcing means that when the sensor is
actuated<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.769> completes<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.760> path<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.510> V<00:02:54.780> +

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
actuated it completes the path to V +

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.009 
actuated it completes the path to V +
and<00:02:57.829> syncing<00:02:58.829> means<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.269> opposite<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
and syncing means the opposite the

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.850 
and syncing means the opposite the
sensor<00:03:01.319> completes<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.829> path<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.910> ground<00:03:03.390> or<00:03:03.860> V

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
sensor completes the path to ground or V

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.500 
sensor completes the path to ground or V
-<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:07.739> lot<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.519> times<00:03:08.670> people<00:03:08.849> get<00:03:09.120> ground

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
- and a lot of times people get ground

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.309 
- and a lot of times people get ground
and<00:03:10.019> V<00:03:10.470> -<00:03:10.890> confused<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> most<00:03:12.930> part<00:03:13.170> with

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
and V - confused for the most part with

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.569 
and V - confused for the most part with
sensors<00:03:13.769> ground<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.970> -<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:16.680> don't<00:03:17.099> get<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
sensors ground is - but don't get the

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.090 
sensors ground is - but don't get the
idea<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.940> ground<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.079> always<00:03:19.260> -<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.920> doesn't

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
idea that ground is always - it doesn't

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.979 
idea that ground is always - it doesn't
have<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.880> we'll<00:03:21.329> talk<00:03:21.510> about<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.870> in

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
have to be and we'll talk about that in

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.960 
have to be and we'll talk about that in
later<00:03:22.400> lectures<00:03:24.889> so<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.519> next<00:03:26.700> thing<00:03:26.850> we'll

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
later lectures so the next thing we'll

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.479 
later lectures so the next thing we'll
do<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.209> we'll<00:03:27.299> hook<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.660> up<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.530> external

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
do is we'll hook this up to a external

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:38.589 
do is we'll hook this up to a external
LED<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.840> we'll<00:03:31.319> see<00:03:31.470> what<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.680> does

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.679 

okay<00:03:39.499> we're<00:03:39.620> going<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.799> hook<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.040> sensor<00:03:40.430> up

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
okay we're going to hook the sensor up

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.959 
okay we're going to hook the sensor up
to<00:03:41.689> see<00:03:41.930> how<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.230> supplies<00:03:42.739> current<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.639> a<00:03:43.670> load

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:43.969 
to see how it supplies current to a load

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.199 
to see how it supplies current to a load
and<00:03:44.299> I'm<00:03:44.810> just<00:03:44.930> going<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.079> use<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.260> small

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
and I'm just going to use a small

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.729 
and I'm just going to use a small
incandescent<00:03:47.209> bulb<00:03:47.689> just<00:03:48.019> because<00:03:48.319> it's<00:03:48.469> easy

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
incandescent bulb just because it's easy

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.300 
incandescent bulb just because it's easy
to<00:03:48.859> interface<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.969> an<00:03:50.629> LED<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.469> nice<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.129> you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
to interface to an LED is nice but you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.770 
to interface to an LED is nice but you
have<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.609> have<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.790> current<00:03:53.060> limiting<00:03:53.359> resistor

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
have to have a current limiting resistor

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.890 
have to have a current limiting resistor
for<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.109> this<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:54.980> real<00:03:55.730> quick<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.359> easy<00:03:56.569> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
for that this is real quick and easy and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.709 
for that this is real quick and easy and
it<00:03:57.889> it's<00:03:58.609> fairly<00:03:58.819> bright<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.359> you<00:03:59.450> can<00:03:59.569> see

00:03:59.709 --> 00:03:59.719 
it it's fairly bright so you can see

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.869 
it it's fairly bright so you can see
what's<00:03:59.900> going<00:03:59.959> on<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.010> anyway<00:04:01.340> I've<00:04:01.430> got<00:04:01.609> these

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
what's going on so anyway I've got these

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.920 
what's going on so anyway I've got these
two<00:04:02.150> leads<00:04:02.420> hook<00:04:02.719> to<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.769> incandescent<00:04:04.489> bulb

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
two leads hook to the incandescent bulb

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.670 
two leads hook to the incandescent bulb
first<00:04:05.930> thing<00:04:06.079> we're<00:04:06.169> going<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.319> do<00:04:06.469> though<00:04:06.650> is

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
first thing we're going to do though is

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.190 
first thing we're going to do though is
we're<00:04:07.129> going<00:04:07.219> to<00:04:07.280> take<00:04:07.489> our<00:04:07.930> battery<00:04:08.930> here<00:04:09.169> a

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
we're going to take our battery here a

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.520 
we're going to take our battery here a
9-volt<00:04:09.620> battery<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.750> I've<00:04:11.750> got<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.139> red<00:04:12.319> lead

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
9-volt battery and I've got the red lead

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.330 
9-volt battery and I've got the red lead
hook<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:13.010> plus<00:04:13.909> and<00:04:14.409> the<00:04:15.409> green<00:04:15.620> lead<00:04:15.829> hook<00:04:16.070> to

hook to plus and the green lead hook to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.719 
hook to plus and the green lead hook to
minus<00:04:16.940> on<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.209> battery<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.280> red<00:04:19.519> lead<00:04:19.699> is

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
minus on the battery so the red lead is

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.080 
minus on the battery so the red lead is
going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> go<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.239> my<00:04:20.889> brown<00:04:21.889> wire<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.880> green

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
going to go to my brown wire the green

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.060 
going to go to my brown wire the green
lead<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.509> going<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.720> go<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.930> my<00:04:27.470> blue<00:04:27.830> wire

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
lead is going to go to my blue wire

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.790 
lead is going to go to my blue wire
don't<00:04:28.789> go<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:28.970> black<00:04:29.210> that's<00:04:29.599> easy<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.650> do

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
don't go to black that's easy to do

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.860 
don't go to black that's easy to do
because<00:04:31.009> most<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.150> time<00:04:32.330> they<00:04:32.419> identify

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
because most the time they identify

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.439 
because most the time they identify
black<00:04:33.229> with<00:04:36.070> negative<00:04:37.070> but<00:04:37.820> that's<00:04:38.120> not<00:04:38.300> the

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
black with negative but that's not the

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.689 
black with negative but that's not the
case<00:04:38.630> with<00:04:38.780> sensors<00:04:39.199> also<00:04:39.710> be<00:04:40.250> careful

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
case with sensors also be careful

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.420 
case with sensors also be careful
because<00:04:41.030> not<00:04:41.750> all<00:04:41.930> sensors<00:04:42.410> have<00:04:42.979> a<00:04:43.009> color

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
because not all sensors have a color

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.600 
because not all sensors have a color
code<00:04:43.759> that<00:04:44.240> makes<00:04:44.750> sense<00:04:45.080> for<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.159> most<00:04:46.340> part

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
code that makes sense for the most part

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.390 
code that makes sense for the most part
you'll<00:04:46.909> see<00:04:47.120> brown<00:04:47.389> blue<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:47.900> black<00:04:48.080> or<00:04:48.409> brown

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
you'll see brown blue and black or brown

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.350 
you'll see brown blue and black or brown
blue<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:49.820> white<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:51.560> it's<00:04:52.180> depending<00:04:53.180> on<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
blue and white if it's depending on the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.930 
blue and white if it's depending on the
type<00:04:53.509> of<00:04:53.539> sensor<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.080> is<00:04:54.220> but<00:04:55.220> what<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.699> see

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
type of sensor it is but what you see

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.820 
type of sensor it is but what you see
most<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.360> time<00:04:56.570> for<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.810> three-wire<00:04:57.259> sensor

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
most of the time for a three-wire sensor

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.550 
most of the time for a three-wire sensor
is<00:04:58.479> brown<00:04:59.500> blue<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.770> black<00:05:02.259> okay<00:05:03.259> so<00:05:03.320> I've<00:05:03.530> got

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
is brown blue and black okay so I've got

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.600 
is brown blue and black okay so I've got
this<00:05:03.830> hooked<00:05:04.099> up<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:05.270> power<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.280> if<00:05:07.400> I<00:05:07.460> take

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
this hooked up to power and so if I take

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.089 
this hooked up to power and so if I take
the<00:05:07.789> sensor<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.590> put<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.680> down<00:05:09.800> on<00:05:10.070> the

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
the sensor and I put it down on the

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.350 
the sensor and I put it down on the
table<00:05:11.080> sensing<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.229> tabletop<00:05:12.949> or<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:13.370> can<00:05:13.550> have

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
table sensing the tabletop or I can have

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.620 
table sensing the tabletop or I can have
it<00:05:14.419> since<00:05:14.720> my<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.860> notice<00:05:16.789> if<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:16.970> even<00:05:17.180> grab<00:05:17.449> it

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
it since my and notice if I even grab it

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.060 
it since my and notice if I even grab it
on<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.750> sides<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.380> goes<00:05:18.590> off<00:05:18.800> these

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
on the sides it goes off these

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.740 
on the sides it goes off these
capacitive<00:05:19.759> sensors<00:05:20.060> are<00:05:20.180> pretty<00:05:20.360> sensitive

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
capacitive sensors are pretty sensitive

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.129 
capacitive sensors are pretty sensitive
that<00:05:20.930> way<00:05:21.430> okay<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:22.490> that's<00:05:22.930> indicator<00:05:23.930> lights

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
that way okay so that's indicator lights

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.420 
that way okay so that's indicator lights
telling<00:05:24.530> me<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.860> sensor<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.250> actually

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
telling me that the sensor is actually

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.980 
telling me that the sensor is actually
act<00:05:25.820> activated<00:05:27.280> okay<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:28.400> it's<00:05:28.639> activated<00:05:29.479> but

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
act activated okay so it's activated but

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.510 
act activated okay so it's activated but
we're<00:05:30.139> not<00:05:30.229> driving<00:05:30.409> anything<00:05:30.949> yet<00:05:31.130> with<00:05:31.340> it

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
we're not driving anything yet with it

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.260 
we're not driving anything yet with it
so<00:05:32.000> let's<00:05:32.210> hook<00:05:32.330> up<00:05:32.419> our<00:05:32.599> load<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:34.240> before<00:05:35.240> I

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
so let's hook up our load and before I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.180 
so let's hook up our load and before I
do<00:05:35.360> that<00:05:35.449> let<00:05:35.750> me<00:05:35.780> go<00:05:35.930> back<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.380> this<00:05:36.500> diagram

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
do that let me go back to this diagram

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.010 
do that let me go back to this diagram
here<00:05:37.849> on<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.780> sensor<00:05:39.400> this<00:05:40.400> particular

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
here on the sensor this particular

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.249 
here on the sensor this particular
sensor<00:05:42.020> has<00:05:43.389> some<00:05:44.389> information<00:05:44.900> here<00:05:45.080> that's

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
sensor has some information here that's

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.830 
sensor has some information here that's
useful<00:05:45.500> of<00:05:45.949> the<00:05:46.630> current<00:05:47.630> carrying

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
useful of the current carrying

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.839 
useful of the current carrying
capability<00:05:47.990> for<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.710> sensors<00:05:49.070> 300<00:05:49.580> milliamps

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
capability for the sensors 300 milliamps

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.680 
capability for the sensors 300 milliamps
and<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:51.080> tells<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.590> that

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
and it tells you that

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.600 
and it tells you that
the<00:05:53.690> capability<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.830> voltage<00:05:55.130> capability

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
the capability the voltage capability

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.490 
the capability the voltage capability
for<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.790> sensor<00:05:56.150> is<00:05:56.440> six<00:05:58.570> volts<00:05:59.570> 230<00:06:00.080> volts

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
for the sensor is six volts 230 volts

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.720 
for the sensor is six volts 230 volts
and<00:06:00.590> you<00:06:00.680> may<00:06:00.800> be<00:06:00.860> able<00:06:00.980> to<00:06:01.100> see<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.430> or<00:06:01.550> not

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
and you may be able to see that or not

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.350 
and you may be able to see that or not
it's<00:06:02.020> not<00:06:03.020> coming<00:06:03.500> in<00:06:03.710> real<00:06:04.670> clear<00:06:04.940> here<00:06:05.180> but

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
it's not coming in real clear here but

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.730 
it's not coming in real clear here but
there<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:05.690> go<00:06:05.920> so<00:06:06.920> it's<00:06:07.340> six<00:06:07.670> volts<00:06:08.090> to<00:06:08.740> 36

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
there you go so it's six volts to 36

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.360 
there you go so it's six volts to 36
volts<00:06:10.070> at<00:06:11.060> 300<00:06:11.960> milliamps<00:06:12.200> turns<00:06:12.860> out<00:06:13.010> my<00:06:13.130> lamp

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
volts at 300 milliamps turns out my lamp

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.610 
volts at 300 milliamps turns out my lamp
is<00:06:13.640> going<00:06:13.880> to<00:06:13.970> draw<00:06:14.180> about<00:06:14.810> half<00:06:15.020> that<00:06:15.050> so

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
is going to draw about half that so

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.770 
is going to draw about half that so
we're<00:06:16.040> safe<00:06:16.310> okay<00:06:19.060> so<00:06:20.060> now<00:06:20.330> I'm<00:06:20.450> going<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.660> hook

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
we're safe okay so now I'm going to hook

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.800 
we're safe okay so now I'm going to hook
up<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.380> sensor<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:24.710> lamp<00:06:25.010> and<00:06:25.610> so<00:06:26.570> the<00:06:26.690> way

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
up the sensor to the lamp and so the way

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.710 
up the sensor to the lamp and so the way
I<00:06:26.840> do<00:06:26.960> that<00:06:27.290> is<00:06:27.640> remember<00:06:28.640> this<00:06:28.760> is<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:28.970> sourcing

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
I do that is remember this is a sourcing

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.400 
I do that is remember this is a sourcing
sensor<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:31.580> we're<00:06:32.210> going<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.420> hook<00:06:32.600> the<00:06:33.200> black

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
sensor so we're going to hook the black

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.160 
sensor so we're going to hook the black
terminal<00:06:33.800> to<00:06:34.100> one<00:06:34.340> of<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.490> leads<00:06:34.700> and<00:06:35.170> because

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
terminal to one of the leads and because

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.860 
terminal to one of the leads and because
it's<00:06:36.350> sourcing<00:06:36.830> we<00:06:37.250> want<00:06:37.460> the<00:06:37.610> other<00:06:37.820> lead<00:06:38.060> to

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
it's sourcing we want the other lead to

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.010 
it's sourcing we want the other lead to
go<00:06:39.080> to<00:06:40.090> ground<00:06:41.830> so<00:06:42.830> once<00:06:43.070> I<00:06:43.160> do<00:06:43.220> that<00:06:43.340> I<00:06:43.790> have<00:06:44.720> a

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
go to ground so once I do that I have a

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.290 
go to ground so once I do that I have a
path<00:06:45.590> a<00:06:45.860> possible<00:06:46.280> path<00:06:46.490> when<00:06:46.820> the<00:06:46.910> sensor<00:06:47.270> is

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
path a possible path when the sensor is

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.510 
path a possible path when the sensor is
actuated<00:06:48.230> so<00:06:48.530> let's<00:06:48.680> go<00:06:48.800> ahead<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:48.980> actuate

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
actuated so let's go ahead and actuate

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.120 
actuated so let's go ahead and actuate
it<00:06:49.550> and<00:06:49.880> there<00:06:50.870> we<00:06:50.960> go<00:06:51.080> we've<00:06:51.290> got<00:06:51.320> a<00:06:51.650> complete

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
it and there we go we've got a complete

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.780 
it and there we go we've got a complete
circuit<00:06:52.610> the<00:06:53.360> sensor<00:06:53.810> switch<00:06:54.560> the<00:06:54.980> PNP<00:06:55.400> switch

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
circuit the sensor switch the PNP switch

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.580 
circuit the sensor switch the PNP switch
in<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.210> sensor<00:06:56.600> is<00:06:57.730> allowing<00:06:58.930> the<00:06:59.930> positive

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
in the sensor is allowing the positive

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.190 
in the sensor is allowing the positive
voltage<00:07:00.770> from<00:07:01.160> the<00:07:01.250> battery<00:07:01.610> to<00:07:02.420> reach<00:07:02.690> the

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
voltage from the battery to reach the

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.220 
voltage from the battery to reach the
load<00:07:03.410> go<00:07:04.310> through<00:07:04.880> the<00:07:05.000> load<00:07:05.210> into<00:07:05.960> ground

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
load go through the load into ground

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.520 
load go through the load into ground
when<00:07:06.740> I<00:07:07.720> activate<00:07:08.720> the<00:07:08.960> sensor<00:07:11.260> now<00:07:12.260> you<00:07:12.320> can

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
when I activate the sensor now you can

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.570 
when I activate the sensor now you can
have<00:07:12.710> normally<00:07:13.250> open<00:07:13.910> sensors<00:07:14.330> like<00:07:14.540> this<00:07:14.810> in

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
have normally open sensors like this in

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.520 
have normally open sensors like this in
which<00:07:16.580> the<00:07:16.610> switch<00:07:16.940> closes<00:07:17.440> when<00:07:18.440> you

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
which the switch closes when you

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.560 
which the switch closes when you
activate<00:07:18.980> the<00:07:19.100> sensor<00:07:19.490> but<00:07:20.180> you<00:07:20.300> can<00:07:20.450> also

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
activate the sensor but you can also

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.990 
activate the sensor but you can also
have<00:07:20.840> normally<00:07:21.290> closed<00:07:21.650> sensors<00:07:22.130> that<00:07:22.580> open

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
have normally closed sensors that open

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.920 
have normally closed sensors that open
the<00:07:23.090> switch<00:07:23.440> when<00:07:24.440> you<00:07:25.480> activate<00:07:26.480> the<00:07:26.600> sensor

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
the switch when you activate the sensor

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.840 
the switch when you activate the sensor
so<00:07:27.080> you<00:07:27.110> have<00:07:27.260> to<00:07:27.380> be<00:07:27.470> careful<00:07:27.950> about<00:07:28.100> when

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:28.850 
so you have to be careful about when

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.490 
so you have to be careful about when
you're<00:07:28.970> ordering<00:07:29.270> the<00:07:29.390> sensor<00:07:29.780> that<00:07:30.380> you

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
you're ordering the sensor that you

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.040 
you're ordering the sensor that you
order<00:07:30.770> it<00:07:30.830> with<00:07:30.919> right<00:07:31.100> characteristics<00:07:31.910> in

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
order it with right characteristics in

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.390 
order it with right characteristics in
reality<00:07:33.050> it<00:07:33.290> doesn't<00:07:33.500> matter<00:07:33.800> what<00:07:34.100> kind<00:07:34.250> of

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
reality it doesn't matter what kind of

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.220 
reality it doesn't matter what kind of
sensor<00:07:34.820> you're<00:07:34.970> using<00:07:35.270> if<00:07:35.870> you're<00:07:36.020> going<00:07:36.169> to

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
sensor you're using if you're going to

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.790 
sensor you're using if you're going to
hook<00:07:36.290> it<00:07:36.410> up<00:07:36.500> to<00:07:36.560> a<00:07:36.680> PLC<00:07:37.930> you<00:07:38.930> can<00:07:39.140> get<00:07:39.290> any<00:07:39.530> kind

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 
hook it up to a PLC you can get any kind

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.580 
hook it up to a PLC you can get any kind
of<00:07:39.980> behavior<00:07:40.460> you<00:07:40.490> want<00:07:40.960> through<00:07:41.960> the<00:07:42.110> PLC

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.590 
of behavior you want through the PLC

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.530 
of behavior you want through the PLC
programming<00:07:43.070> so<00:07:44.060> whether<00:07:44.300> you<00:07:44.390> have<00:07:44.450> a

normally closed renoble open sensor it

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.730 
normally closed renoble open sensor it
doesn't<00:07:46.730> really<00:07:46.880> matter<00:07:47.230> but<00:07:48.230> it<00:07:48.380> does<00:07:48.530> matter

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:48.740 
doesn't really matter but it does matter

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.380 
doesn't really matter but it does matter
if<00:07:49.100> your<00:07:49.280> piece<00:07:49.490> of<00:07:49.520> equipment<00:07:49.669> is<00:07:50.090> already

if your piece of equipment is already

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.409 
if your piece of equipment is already
set<00:07:50.660> up<00:07:50.690> to<00:07:51.410> handle<00:07:51.620> uh<00:07:51.919> normally<00:07:52.310> closed<00:07:52.610> or<00:07:53.360> a

PLC program to accommodate the new
sensor<00:08:02.470> so<00:08:03.470> hope<00:08:03.620> this<00:08:03.650> was<00:08:03.919> useful<00:08:04.510> I'll<00:08:05.510> do

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.690 
sensor so hope this was useful I'll do

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.040 
sensor so hope this was useful I'll do
another

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.050 
another

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.779 
another
