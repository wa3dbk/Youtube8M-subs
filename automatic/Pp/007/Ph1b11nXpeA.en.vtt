00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.590
 it took me two days to arrive 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.930
 practically full HD with USB input 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.219
 which reads practically most of the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.110
 formats in circulation today 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.350

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.300

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.150
 as for the prices I paid 191 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.270

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.400
 be really satisfied with a hundred hearts 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.540
 what else is that you do n't believe 100 vers 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 and anyway I saw you in the tops 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.400
 amazon seller so I said why 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.970
 don't take it and really guys it was time 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.890
 because that is why for more than ten years I have 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 played in the dining room 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.060
 probably practically attacked 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.010
 to the kitchen so it really was a nightmare 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.820
 really play in one thing 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.010
 indescribable 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.700
 on the contrary, expect to see where 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.140
 I played 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.910
 sorry for the darkness 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.130
 if I played there and then that 40 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.980
 inch maybe it is a tv also emerges 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.050
 however, even a little older is the 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.650
 problem was that there is the kitchen then 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.560
 I used to play there and it was the slaughter that is that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.290
 who knows me on skype 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.870
 well and the others in the group know it was 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.900
 something indescribable because 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.540
 we were always all the brothel i 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.150
 my came here made casinos e 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.020
 all the rest so here we say was 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.110
 a bit a company to play maybe 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.300

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.640
