this in half and mix up two different
batches<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.280> it'd<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.399> worth

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
batches but I don't think it'd be worth

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
batches but I don't think it'd be worth
the<00:00:47.820> hassle<00:00:47.940> honestly<00:00:48.660> you're<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> supposed

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the hassle honestly you're just supposed

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.000 
the hassle honestly you're just supposed
to<00:00:49.289> make<00:00:49.379> yourself<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:51.260> one-pound<00:00:52.260> batch<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to make yourself a a one-pound batch of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
to make yourself a a one-pound batch of
frosting<00:00:53.550> every<00:00:53.820> time<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.539> so

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
frosting every time you do this so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060

in a cupcake before if you like cotton
candy<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:47.820> you'll<00:01:47.970> enjoy<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:49.259> my

personal thing and finally chocolate

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
personal thing and finally chocolate
marshmallow<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.290> i<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.189> pretty

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
marshmallow which i think is a pretty

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.260 
marshmallow which i think is a pretty
good<00:01:53.460> idea<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> flavor<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
good idea for a flavor as good as a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.679 
good idea for a flavor as good as a
really<00:01:57.570> creamy<00:01:58.219> light<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.579> would<00:02:00.030> say<00:02:00.240> area

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
really creamy light I would say area

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.530 
really creamy light I would say area
chocolate<00:02:01.229> flavor<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.969> sort

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
chocolate flavor to it it's not as sort

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.620 
chocolate flavor to it it's not as sort
of<00:02:03.570> cocoa<00:02:03.990> intense<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.770> would<00:02:04.950> prefer<00:02:05.630> it's
