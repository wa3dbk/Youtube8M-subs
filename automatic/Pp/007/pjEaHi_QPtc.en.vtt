feature<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:49.610> well<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:51.320> think<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.280> will<00:03:52.489> hold

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
feature as well I think this will hold

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.180 
feature as well I think this will hold
probably<00:03:52.940> three<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.020> half<00:03:54.080> ounces<00:03:54.709> i<00:03:54.770> think

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
probably three and a half ounces i think

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.400 
probably three and a half ounces i think
is<00:03:55.310> what<00:03:55.459> they<00:03:55.550> say<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.910> use<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.510> will<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.140> uses

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
is what they say it use it will it uses

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.770 
is what they say it use it will it uses
