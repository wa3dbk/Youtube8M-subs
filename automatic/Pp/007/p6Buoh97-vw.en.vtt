00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.690 
added into battlefield 4 that's kind of
gone<00:00:29.550> under<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.030> radar<00:00:30.320> until<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:31.770> now

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
gone under the radar until just now now

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
gone under the radar until just now now
they<00:00:32.940> could<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.300> possibly<00:00:33.570> added<00:00:34.230> this

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
feature in recently it could possibly be

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.130

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
dragon's teeth DLC or it could have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.570

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

something<00:01:01.470> or<00:01:01.589> another<00:01:01.769> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.339> was

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
watch so yeah I thought that this was an

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
watch so yeah I thought that this was an
interesting<00:01:53.009> issue<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.579> definitely<00:01:54.000> wanted<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
interesting issue I definitely wanted to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
interesting issue I definitely wanted to
discuss<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.320> whether<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.859> was<00:01:56.009> possibly

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
discuss it whether it was possibly

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.899 
discuss it whether it was possibly
intentional<00:01:57.299> by<00:01:57.450> dice<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.140> maybe<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
intentional by dice or maybe it's just a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
intentional by dice or maybe it's just a
bug<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.420> nice<00:02:00.780> needs<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> fix<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.219> either

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
bug that nice needs to fix and either

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.660 
bug that nice needs to fix and either
way<00:02:02.789> in<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.119> opinion<00:02:03.359> dice<00:02:03.810> needs<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.469> get<00:02:05.429> rid

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
way in my opinion dice needs to get rid

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.609 
way in my opinion dice needs to get rid
of<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.359> will<00:02:06.539> go<00:02:06.659> into<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.469> just

earlier<00:02:13.700> because<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.030> really<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
earlier because it's really going to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.390 
earlier because it's really going to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
show you how it works I'm going to try

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.160 
show you how it works I'm going to try
to<00:02:17.430> explain<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> doesn't<00:02:18.930> come

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
to explain it but if it doesn't come
across<00:02:19.320> good<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.160> yeah<00:02:20.790> definitely<00:02:21.210> make

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
across good and yeah definitely make

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.930 
across good and yeah definitely make
sure<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.720> check<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.080> his<00:02:22.230> video<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:23.490> basically

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
sure to check out his video is basically

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600 
sure to check out his video is basically
when<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> player<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.050> nearing<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.159> enemies

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
when a player is nearing the enemies

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.960 
when a player is nearing the enemies
that

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.940 
that
employment<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.720> area<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> where<00:02:28.830> they

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
employment the area of where they

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220 
employment the area of where they
initially<00:02:29.280> spawn<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.270> vehicle<00:02:30.780> spawning

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
initially spawn in with vehicle spawning

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.990 
initially spawn in with vehicle spawning
and<00:02:31.350> all<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.710> well<00:02:32.550> when<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> player<00:02:32.970> is

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
and all that well when a player is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.450 
and all that well when a player is
approaching<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.810> area<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.410> are

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
approaching that area they are

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.630 
approaching that area they are
automatically<00:02:35.690> spotted<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.930> mini-map

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
automatically spotted on the mini-map

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.980 
automatically spotted on the mini-map
now<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.120> why<00:02:39.270> I'm<00:02:39.390> kind<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.690> thinking

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
now this is why I'm kind of thinking

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.860 
now this is why I'm kind of thinking
that<00:02:40.380> nice<00:02:41.240> intentionally<00:02:42.240> put<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> into<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that nice intentionally put it into the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.340 
that nice intentionally put it into the
game<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.410> possibly<00:02:44.040> warrant<00:02:44.670> ward<00:02:45.060> off<00:02:45.350> base

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
game to possibly warrant ward off base

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.430 
game to possibly warrant ward off base
rapers<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.280> spawn<00:02:47.610> campers<00:02:48.180> or<00:02:48.390> things<00:02:49.230> of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
rapers or spawn campers or things of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.850 
rapers or spawn campers or things of
that<00:02:49.500> nature<00:02:50.060> which<00:02:51.060> may<00:02:52.020> be<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.320> feature<00:02:52.710> that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
that nature which may be a feature that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.640 
that nature which may be a feature that
some<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.580> would<00:02:53.730> actually<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.870> in

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
some of you would actually like to be in

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800 
some of you would actually like to be in
the<00:02:55.890> game<00:02:56.100> no<00:02:56.430> personally<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> don't<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the game no personally I don't want to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.020 
the game no personally I don't want to
feature<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.220> into<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> game<00:02:59.730> in<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
feature like that into the game in the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.180 
feature like that into the game in the
game<00:03:00.380> ravick<00:03:01.380> pointed<00:03:01.740> out<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
game ravick pointed out in the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.800 
game ravick pointed out in the
description<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.850> his<00:03:03.000> video<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.630> thought

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
description of his video and I thought

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.050 
description of his video and I thought
that<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.140> was<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> good<00:03:04.830> point<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:05.640> never

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that this was a good point it's never

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.110 
that this was a good point it's never
been<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.840> battlefield<00:03:07.170> game<00:03:07.590> before<00:03:08.120> now

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
been in a battlefield game before now

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.940 
been in a battlefield game before now
that<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.450> makes<00:03:09.690> sense<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.170> me<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.680> never

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that just makes sense to me it's never

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.890 
that just makes sense to me it's never
been<00:03:11.130> in<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.370> battlefield<00:03:11.730> game<00:03:12.090> before<00:03:12.450> people

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
been in a battlefield game before people

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.750 
been in a battlefield game before people
love<00:03:13.110> battlefield<00:03:13.740> leave<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.490> out<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
love battlefield leave it out of the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.420 
love battlefield leave it out of the
game<00:03:14.970> we<00:03:15.330> don't<00:03:15.480> need<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.959> sure<00:03:16.380> base<00:03:16.950> raping

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
game we don't need that sure base raping

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.000 
game we don't need that sure base raping
suck<00:03:17.790> sometimes<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:19.080> most<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> maps<00:03:19.800> in

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
suck sometimes but most of the maps in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.920 
suck sometimes but most of the maps in
battlefield<00:03:20.520> 4<00:03:20.610> were<00:03:20.970> actually<00:03:21.450> designed

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
battlefield 4 were actually designed

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.320 
battlefield 4 were actually designed
pretty<00:03:22.320> well<00:03:22.590> where<00:03:22.890> base<00:03:23.520> raping<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.120> not

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
pretty well where base raping is not

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.510 
pretty well where base raping is not
possible<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.080> let's<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.500> say<00:03:25.680> dice<00:03:25.950> actually

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
possible so let's just say dice actually

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.820 
possible so let's just say dice actually
meant<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.390> as<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.959> feature<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
meant to have this as a feature in the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.979 
meant to have this as a feature in the
game<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.370> really<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:30.030> felt<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.690> was

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
game and really just felt like it was

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.110 
game and really just felt like it was
something<00:03:31.230> they<00:03:31.500> can<00:03:31.650> let<00:03:31.830> slide<00:03:32.220> under<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
something they can let slide under the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.479 
something they can let slide under the
radar<00:03:33.480> well<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.470> good<00:03:34.650> thing<00:03:34.709> somebody's

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
radar well it's a good thing somebody's

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.180 
radar well it's a good thing somebody's
actually<00:03:35.730> found<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.830> tested<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.980> and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
actually found it and tested it and

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.310 
actually found it and tested it and
seeing<00:03:38.519> how<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.090> works<00:03:39.420> because<00:03:40.290> it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
seeing how it really works because it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.520 
seeing how it really works because it
does<00:03:40.769> present<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.670> huge<00:03:42.180> issue<00:03:42.420> whether<00:03:43.200> or<00:03:43.380> not

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
does present a huge issue whether or not

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.229 
does present a huge issue whether or not
you<00:03:43.709> think<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> good<00:03:44.310> idea<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.700> ward<00:03:45.150> off

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
you think it's a good idea to ward off

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.199 
you think it's a good idea to ward off
base<00:03:45.630> rapers<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.920> definitely<00:03:47.700> needs<00:03:48.030> some

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
base rapers it definitely needs some

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.449 
base rapers it definitely needs some
tweaking<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.110> they<00:03:49.350> are<00:03:49.620> going<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.040> put<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.370> in

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
tweaking if they are going to put it in

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.090 
tweaking if they are going to put it in
the<00:03:50.580> game<00:03:50.790> if<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.780> check<00:03:52.110> out<00:03:52.260> radix<00:03:52.769> video

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
the game if you check out radix video

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.150 
the game if you check out radix video
you'll<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> lot<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.300> situations<00:03:54.950> where<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
you'll see a lot of situations where the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.060 
you'll see a lot of situations where the
radar<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.239> actually<00:03:57.959> picking<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.530> on<00:03:58.680> players

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
radar is actually picking up on players

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.960 
radar is actually picking up on players
while<00:03:59.880> they<00:04:00.030> are<00:04:00.209> on<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:01.170> flag<00:04:01.560> nearest<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
while they are on the flag nearest the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.509 
while they are on the flag nearest the
enemy's<00:04:03.450> base<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.230> their<00:04:04.410> own<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:05.250> flag

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
enemy's base so if their own the flag

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.370 
enemy's base so if their own the flag
near<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.030> enemy<00:04:06.330> base<00:04:06.600> they<00:04:06.930> are<00:04:06.959> still

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
near the enemy base they are still

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.580 
near the enemy base they are still
showing<00:04:07.769> up<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.459> radar<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.230> just

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
showing up on the radar so if it's just

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.610 
showing up on the radar so if it's just
trying<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.980> point<00:04:11.190> out<00:04:11.360> base<00:04:12.360> rapers<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.140> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
trying to point out base rapers and it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.130 
trying to point out base rapers and it
definitely<00:04:13.830> needs<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.459> be<00:04:14.580> tweaked<00:04:15.109> quite<00:04:16.109> a

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
definitely needs to be tweaked quite a

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.680 
definitely needs to be tweaked quite a
bit<00:04:16.410> especially<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.609> quite<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.209> few<00:04:18.330> of<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
bit especially on quite a few of the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.570 
bit especially on quite a few of the
maps<00:04:18.900> definitely<00:04:19.530> check<00:04:19.739> out<00:04:19.859> rabbits<00:04:20.310> video

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
maps definitely check out rabbits video

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.730 
maps definitely check out rabbits video
he'll<00:04:20.850> point<00:04:21.060> him<00:04:21.180> out<00:04:21.359> I'll<00:04:22.140> name<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.470> few

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
he'll point him out I'll name a few

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.460 
he'll point him out I'll name a few
examples<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:24.090> first<00:04:24.330> example<00:04:24.540> he<00:04:24.960> gave<00:04:25.140> was

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
examples the first example he gave was

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.030 
examples the first example he gave was
the<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.680> flag<00:04:26.280> on<00:04:26.550> sunken<00:04:27.270> dragon<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.650> radars

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
the a flag on sunken dragon the radars

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.100 
the a flag on sunken dragon the radars
picking<00:04:29.340> players<00:04:29.790> up<00:04:30.120> because<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.510> flag<00:04:30.900> is

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
picking players up because that flag is

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.670 
picking players up because that flag is
so<00:04:31.380> close<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:33.090> enemy's<00:04:33.570> deployment<00:04:34.260> area

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
so close to the enemy's deployment area

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.360 
so close to the enemy's deployment area
or<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.849> flag<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:36.330> rogue<00:04:36.810> transmission

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
or the a flag on rogue transmission

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.279 
or the a flag on rogue transmission
because<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.940> flag<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:39.690> close

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
because that flag is so close

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.649 
because that flag is so close
to<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.469> enemy<00:04:40.860> deployment<00:04:41.460> area<00:04:41.819> so<00:04:42.539> it

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
to the enemy deployment area so it

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.109 
to the enemy deployment area so it
definitely<00:04:42.930> needs<00:04:43.499> some<00:04:43.649> tweaking<00:04:44.099> even<00:04:44.969> on

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:45.119 
definitely needs some tweaking even on

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:48.829 
definitely needs some tweaking even on
game<00:04:45.419> modes<00:04:45.689> like<00:04:45.839> rush<00:04:46.339> where<00:04:47.599> and<00:04:48.599> I'm<00:04:48.689> not

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:48.839 
game modes like rush where and I'm not

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:50.269 
game modes like rush where and I'm not
really<00:04:49.020> sure<00:04:49.110> how<00:04:49.559> this<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:49.800> going<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.129> work

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:50.279 
really sure how this is going to work

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.659 
really sure how this is going to work
once<00:04:51.119> you<00:04:51.300> move<00:04:51.569> up<00:04:51.809> an<00:04:52.110> objective<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:53.520> he

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
once you move up an objective but he

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.820 
once you move up an objective but he
points<00:04:54.059> out<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.509> let's<00:04:54.990> see<00:04:55.139> i<00:04:55.349> forget<00:04:55.740> what

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
points out on let's see i forget what

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.719 
points out on let's see i forget what
Zavod<00:04:56.430> 311<00:04:57.110> when<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.649> attackers<00:04:59.189> are<00:04:59.369> able<00:04:59.639> to

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
Zavod 311 when the attackers are able to

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.719 
Zavod 311 when the attackers are able to
move<00:04:59.879> up<00:05:00.089> to<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.389> second<00:05:00.899> base<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:02.069> defenders

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
move up to the second base the defenders

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.989 
move up to the second base the defenders
are<00:05:02.999> spotted<00:05:03.779> almost<00:05:03.990> back<00:05:04.830> all<00:05:05.189> the<00:05:05.849> way<00:05:05.969> to

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:05.999 
are spotted almost back all the way to

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.059 
are spotted almost back all the way to
the<00:05:06.300> second<00:05:06.689> base<00:05:06.809> I<00:05:07.050> mean<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.439> long<00:05:07.740> way

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
the second base I mean it's a long way

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.129 
the second base I mean it's a long way
that<00:05:08.339> they're<00:05:08.460> actually<00:05:08.610> spotted<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.960> let's

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
that they're actually spotted so let's

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.600 
that they're actually spotted so let's
just<00:05:10.319> say<00:05:10.469> they<00:05:10.649> wanted<00:05:10.889> to<00:05:11.009> come<00:05:11.249> up<00:05:11.279> and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
just say they wanted to come up and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.239 
just say they wanted to come up and
steal<00:05:11.969> the<00:05:12.180> tank<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:12.779> come<00:05:13.619> up<00:05:13.770> behind<00:05:13.919> the

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
steal the tank and come up behind the

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.219 
steal the tank and come up behind the
enemy<00:05:14.430> like<00:05:14.819> players<00:05:15.270> used<00:05:15.569> to<00:05:15.689> do<00:05:15.809> all<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
enemy like players used to do all the

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.779 
enemy like players used to do all the
time<00:05:16.439> on<00:05:16.860> grand<00:05:17.610> bazaar<00:05:18.059> in<00:05:18.300> battlefield<00:05:18.959> 3

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
time on grand bazaar in battlefield 3

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.549 
time on grand bazaar in battlefield 3
they<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:21.479> know<00:05:21.509> if<00:05:21.719> players<00:05:21.990> are<00:05:22.199> actually

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:22.559 
they you know if players are actually

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:24.019 
they you know if players are actually
paying<00:05:22.770> attention<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.430> their<00:05:23.580> mini<00:05:23.789> map

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
paying attention to their mini map

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:25.429 
paying attention to their mini map
they're<00:05:24.569> not<00:05:24.719> really<00:05:24.990> going<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.169> have<00:05:25.319> the

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
they're not really going to have the

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.249 
they're not really going to have the
opportunity<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:26.580> do<00:05:26.909> that<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.539> while

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
opportunity to do that and while

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.799 
opportunity to do that and while
stealing<00:05:28.979> players<00:05:29.459> vehicles<00:05:30.089> in<00:05:30.270> battlefield

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:30.809 
stealing players vehicles in battlefield

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.070 
stealing players vehicles in battlefield
that's<00:05:31.379> what<00:05:31.649> battlefield<00:05:32.219> is<00:05:32.399> all<00:05:32.550> about<00:05:33.080> so

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
that's what battlefield is all about so

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.230 
that's what battlefield is all about so
I<00:05:34.409> don't<00:05:35.039> like<00:05:35.249> it<00:05:35.459> in<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:35.759> game<00:05:35.939> especially

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
I don't like it in the game especially

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.989 
I don't like it in the game especially
in<00:05:36.689> game<00:05:36.719> modes<00:05:37.110> like<00:05:37.229> rush<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:38.009> can<00:05:38.490> kind<00:05:38.819> of

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
in game modes like rush I can kind of

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.969 
in game modes like rush I can kind of
see<00:05:39.209> where<00:05:39.389> they<00:05:39.479> were<00:05:39.539> going<00:05:39.659> with<00:05:40.229> conquest

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
see where they were going with conquest

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.909 
see where they were going with conquest
but<00:05:41.759> rush<00:05:42.089> is<00:05:42.360> all<00:05:42.569> about<00:05:43.050> breaking<00:05:43.589> out<00:05:43.709> of<00:05:43.740> a

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
but rush is all about breaking out of a

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.709 
but rush is all about breaking out of a
spawn<00:05:44.189> trap<00:05:44.550> that's<00:05:44.819> what<00:05:45.089> the<00:05:45.269> name<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.629> the

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
spawn trap that's what the name of the

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.170 
spawn trap that's what the name of the
game<00:05:45.899> is<00:05:46.259> it's<00:05:46.559> about<00:05:46.830> getting<00:05:47.189> past<00:05:47.789> the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
game is it's about getting past the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.480 
game is it's about getting past the
enemy<00:05:48.569> team<00:05:48.809> finding<00:05:49.409> a<00:05:49.529> way<00:05:49.680> around<00:05:50.279> the
