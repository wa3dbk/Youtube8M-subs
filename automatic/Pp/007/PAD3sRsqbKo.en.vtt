more<00:00:14.130> fun<00:00:14.490> I'm<00:00:14.820> thinking<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.599> being<00:00:16.320> like

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
more fun I'm thinking like being like

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.870

who<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.949> are<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.580> that's<00:00:17.760> an

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
who we are and I think that's an

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.609 
who we are and I think that's an
important<00:00:18.210> lesson<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.779> into<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.320> really

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
important lesson going into it is really

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.800 
important lesson going into it is really
I<00:00:19.800> mean<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.609> cliche<00:00:21.000> right<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.420> yourself

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I mean it's so cliche right be yourself

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.769 
I mean it's so cliche right be yourself
but<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.529> still<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.010> good<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.449> always

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
but it's still really good to always

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.120 
but it's still really good to always
just<00:00:25.189> from<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> start<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.939> don't<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:28.130> you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
after building it over these four years

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.900 
after building it over these four years

sometimes that they work out extremely

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.810 
sometimes that they work out extremely
well<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:16.680> either<00:02:16.920> way<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.730> is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
well but either way it's a lot of it is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.770 
well but either way it's a lot of it is
if<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.180> come<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> right<00:02:18.750> mindset

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
if you come in with the right mindset

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660 
if you come in with the right mindset
that<00:02:19.320> helps<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.770> you've<00:02:19.890> never<00:02:20.040> had<00:02:20.310> roommate

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that helps but you've never had roommate

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.760 
that helps but you've never had roommate
before<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.960> you've<00:02:22.200> never<00:02:22.350> lived<00:02:22.620> with

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
before and and you've never lived with

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.260 
before and and you've never lived with
your<00:02:22.950> friends<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.490> mean<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.760> might<00:02:23.910> not<00:02:24.060> think

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
your friends I mean you might not think

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.040 
your friends I mean you might not think
that<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:25.110> living<00:02:25.410> habits<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:26.010> usual<00:02:26.670> or

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
that your living habits are usual or

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.180 
that your living habits are usual or
yeah<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.500> difficult<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.950> what

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
yeah so it's difficult to know what

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.350 
yeah so it's difficult to know what
you're<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.460> or<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.910> want<00:02:30.150> really

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you're like or what you want really

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.540 
you're like or what you want really
wouldn't<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:30.990> live<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:31.440> our<00:02:31.590> family<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
wouldn't really live with our family and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.760 
wouldn't really live with our family and
like<00:02:32.880> friends<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.930> short<00:02:34.230> term<00:02:34.410> basis

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
like friends for on short term basis

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.440 
like friends for on short term basis
right<00:02:35.100> or<00:02:35.400> who<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:35.820> along<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.180> best

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
right or who do you get along with best

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.270 
right or who do you get along with best
when<00:02:36.750> you're<00:02:36.870> living<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.320> it's<00:02:37.770> it's<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.250> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
when you're living so it's it's like a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.310 
when you're living so it's it's like a
natural<00:02:38.670> apprehension<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.200> be

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
natural apprehension to have to be

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.320 
natural apprehension to have to be
uncertain<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:41.220> whether<00:02:41.430> you'll<00:02:42.030> get<00:02:42.180> along

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
uncertain of whether you'll get along

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.390 
uncertain of whether you'll get along
with<00:02:42.510> them<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.320> think<00:02:43.560> people<00:02:44.220> should<00:02:44.250> take

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
with them but I think people should take

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
with them but I think people should take
comfort<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.090> knowing<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.900> will<00:02:46.050> get

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
comfort in knowing that you will get

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.460 
comfort in knowing that you will get
along<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.650> them<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:49.110> even<00:02:49.260> if<00:02:49.350> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
along with them and and even if you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.780 
along with them and and even if you
don't<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.280> end<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.610> world

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
don't it's not the end of the world

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.360 
don't it's not the end of the world
because<00:02:51.270> there's<00:02:52.050> nothing<00:02:52.320> else<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.709> you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
because there's nothing else you can you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.010 
because there's nothing else you can you
know<00:02:53.459> make<00:02:53.640> make<00:02:54.060> do<00:02:54.270> with<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
know make make do with what you have and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.449 
know make make do with what you have and
they'll<00:02:55.170> find<00:02:55.380> friends<00:02:55.650> other<00:02:55.800> places<00:02:56.130> but<00:02:56.400> I

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
they'll find friends other places but I

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.460 
they'll find friends other places but I
think<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.660> haven't<00:02:57.930> heard<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.320> like

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
think I really haven't heard of like

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.560 
think I really haven't heard of like
some<00:02:58.980> treacherous<00:02:59.370> remains<00:02:59.730> tuitions<00:03:00.180> at<00:03:00.420> all

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
some treacherous remains tuitions at all

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.360 
some treacherous remains tuitions at all
at<00:03:00.690> Princeton<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.620> that's<00:03:01.860> as<00:03:01.980> well<00:03:02.220> just

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
at Princeton so that's as well just

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.890 
at Princeton so that's as well just
knowing<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.700> everyone's<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.390> right

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
knowing that everyone's there right

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.540 
knowing that everyone's there right
there<00:03:04.080> with<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.410> learning<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.340> same<00:03:05.489> things

there with you learning the same things

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.610

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
each other so that just makes it that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.120 
each other so that just makes it that
makes<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.430> much<00:03:11.550> easier<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.850> bond
