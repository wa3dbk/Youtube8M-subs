00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.680
 movement is life and still a guarantee of health 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.389
 your spine structure 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.400
 spinal flexure 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.349
 formed in the process of evolution when 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 the main occupation of man was hunting 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.240
 Mammoth today is our lot 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.359
 sedentary work and this is a real test 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 for intervertebral disc cartilage which 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.970
 play a role 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 elastic shock absorbers between 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 vertebrae if a person holds a large 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 part of the time at the computer in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.460
 intervertebral discs begin 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.680
 develop 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.930
 dystrophic changes drive loses 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.840
 its structure and there is already a disk 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 disc herniation is a fragment of intervertebral 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.800
 the disk which left the intervertebral canal 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.260
 sometimes this fragment 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 separated from the disk itself and then the doctors 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.570
 call it a sequestration namely sequestration 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.090
 pinches the spinal cord and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 causes severe pain for example in the leg 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.829
 main symptom of intervertebral hernia 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.859
 to diagnose the disk exchange is necessary 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 do mrt research very often 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.150
 neurologists mistakenly assign 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.610
 computed tomography but this method is not 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.619
 enough to diagnose 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 intervertebral disc herniation pain in 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.820
 lower back and then in the leg is a reason 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 consult a neurologist and if 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.439
 conservative treatment does not help 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.299
 ax to visit a neurosurgeon home 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.280
 problem to solve and not to run because 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 weakness in the leg may develop 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.799
 up to the risk of becoming a hostage 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.860
 armchairs 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.570
 another gross violation is a problem with 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.220
 urination may occur 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 retention urination flying 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.369
 urination 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 if in such a case during the patient is not 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.900
 punching these violations can stay 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.670
 for life a standard operation on 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.189
 intervertebral hernia lies in 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 removing a piece of disk squeezing in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.689
 spinal cord root or in removal 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 the whole disk and the one and the other method 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 have disadvantages in the first case when 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.740
 removed only a fragment of the disk can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 arise relapse cartilage goes into 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 spinal canal again removing the same 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.460
 the entire disk may lead to 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.100
 between the vertebrae will not be elastic 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.540
 shock absorber to save the disc but when 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.750
 this save the patient from intervertebral 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.130
 hernia was coming up with a special implant 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.110
 with this operation 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.840
 we only remove the fragment itself which 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.570
 squeezed the nerve root 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.520
 drive leave intact implant 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.190
 neurosurgeon sets in place 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 remote sequestration with this feature 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.510
 intervertebral disc persists a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.510
 hernia and patient pain disappear
