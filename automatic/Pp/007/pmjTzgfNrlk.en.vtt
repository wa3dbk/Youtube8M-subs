shops but all you too just imagine

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.640 
shops but all you too just imagine
something<00:00:33.820> also<00:00:34.210> easily<00:00:34.570> from<00:00:34.810> here<00:00:35.050> when<00:00:35.590> I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
something also easily from here when I

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.960 
something also easily from here when I
take<00:00:35.860> this<00:00:36.040> privet<00:00:36.940> leaf<00:00:37.120> off<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:38.850> don't<00:00:39.850> if

take this privet leaf off and don't if

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.550 
take this privet leaf off and don't if
you<00:00:40.030> can<00:00:40.120> see<00:00:40.329> that<00:00:40.360> on<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.750> end<00:00:40.870> right<00:00:41.260> on<00:00:41.440> the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
you can see that on the end right on the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.360 
you can see that on the end right on the
end<00:00:41.650> there<00:00:42.360> there's<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.450> little<00:00:43.630> stalk<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:45.160> see

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
end there there's a little stalk you see

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.960 
end there there's a little stalk you see
that<00:00:45.550> now<00:00:46.120> imagine<00:00:46.450> that<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:48.220> little<00:00:48.610> stock

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
that now imagine that that little stock

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.890 
that now imagine that that little stock
is<00:00:49.180> called<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.480> PTO

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.800 

and<00:00:51.990> in<00:00:52.800> rhubarb<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.480> only<00:00:54.690> other

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.750 
and in rhubarb and the only other
platter<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:55.740> his<00:00:55.890> gunner<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
platter can think of his gunner in

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.530 
platter can think of his gunner in
rhubarb<00:00:57.330> that<00:00:57.930> PTO<00:00:58.380> is<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.310> big<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.330> that's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
rhubarb that PTO is that big and that's

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.500 
rhubarb that PTO is that big and that's
what<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.870> saw<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.530> growing<00:01:01.920> rhubarb<00:01:02.510> you're

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
what we saw your growing rhubarb you're

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
what we saw your growing rhubarb you're
actually<00:01:03.660> growing<00:01:04.550> ptl's<00:01:05.550> like<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.220> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
actually growing ptl's like that and the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.470 
actually growing ptl's like that and the
hard<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> forgive<00:01:08.730> the<00:01:08.880> noise<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.330> well

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
hard to forgive the noise as well

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.940 
hard to forgive the noise as well
because<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.230> a<00:01:10.260> lot<00:01:10.410> of<00:01:10.500> traveling<00:01:10.800> around

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because it's a lot of traveling around

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.830 
because it's a lot of traveling around

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
today but never mind so rhubarb is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
today but never mind so rhubarb is
actually<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.530> action<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> growing<00:01:18.030> Peters

attached<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.819> both<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.209> them<00:02:23.360> are<00:02:23.659> these<00:02:24.519> two

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
attached to both of them are these two

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.300 
attached to both of them are these two
look<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.689> roots<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.859> in<00:02:27.950> actual<00:02:28.250> fact

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
look like roots but in actual fact

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.030 
look like roots but in actual fact
they're<00:02:29.239> rhizomes<00:02:29.900> there<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.290> rhizome<00:02:30.769> is<00:02:30.799> an

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
they're rhizomes there a rhizome is an

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.020 
they're rhizomes there a rhizome is an
underground<00:02:31.390> stem<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.170> rhizome<00:02:33.709> is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
underground stem and this rhizome is

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.699 
underground stem and this rhizome is
absolutely<00:02:35.030> packed<00:02:35.799> with<00:02:36.939> starch<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.530> is

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
absolutely packed with starch so this is

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.440 
absolutely packed with starch so this is
what<00:02:39.890> keeps<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.310> plant<00:02:40.519> going<00:02:40.730> next<00:02:41.060> year<00:02:41.209> now

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
what keeps the plant going next year now

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.349 
what keeps the plant going next year now
we're<00:02:41.659> going<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.989> divide<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.709> into<00:02:43.150> two<00:02:44.150> by

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
we're going to divide this into two by

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.960 
we're going to divide this into two by
cutting<00:02:44.840> through<00:02:45.620> there<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.099> this<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.519> is

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
cutting through there so this one is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.750 
cutting through there so this one is
going<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.269> go<00:02:47.359> with<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.659> bud<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.799> one<00:02:49.129> and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
going to go with this bud this one and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.849 
going to go with this bud this one and
this<00:02:49.909> together<00:02:50.090> now<00:02:50.389> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.569> look<00:02:50.689> at<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:50.989> it

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
this together now if you look at this it

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.649 
this together now if you look at this it
was<00:02:52.040> rotting<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.639> rescued<00:02:53.090> most<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.569> I'm

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
was rotting I rescued most of it I'm

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.460 
was rotting I rescued most of it I'm
soaked<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.200> water<00:02:54.319> for<00:02:54.680> about<00:02:55.180> three<00:02:56.180> days

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
soaked it in water for about three days

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.899 
soaked it in water for about three days
so<00:02:57.470> I'm<00:02:57.620> going<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.159> do<00:02:58.370> something<00:02:58.790> special

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
so I'm going to do something special

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.809 
so I'm going to do something special
with<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:00.290> piece<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.430> piece<00:03:01.669> is

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
with this this piece but this piece is

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.229 
with this this piece but this piece is
going<00:03:01.970> directly<00:03:02.209> into<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.470> ground<00:03:04.060> now<00:03:05.060> this

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
going directly into the ground now this

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.530 
going directly into the ground now this
is<00:03:05.299> Victoria<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.109> think<00:03:06.939> it's<00:03:07.939> been<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.389> the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
is Victoria I think it's been in the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.110 
is Victoria I think it's been in the
ground<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.900> about<00:03:09.409> four<00:03:09.859> years<00:03:10.189> and<00:03:10.549> we've

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
ground for about four years and we've

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.990 
ground for about four years and we've
only<00:03:11.269> got<00:03:11.569> two<00:03:12.079> these<00:03:12.980> are<00:03:13.129> called<00:03:13.280> crowns<00:03:13.609> or

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
only got two these are called crowns or

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.179 
only got two these are called crowns or
and<00:03:14.689> they're<00:03:14.870> they're<00:03:15.109> kind<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.470> extensions

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
and they're they're kind of extensions

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.159 
and they're they're kind of extensions
of<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.370> stem<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.939> they're<00:03:17.480> full<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.930> birds

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
of the stem and they're full of birds

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.990 
of the stem and they're full of birds
and<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:18.439> is<00:03:18.560> where<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.829> leaves<00:03:19.069> are<00:03:19.819> going

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
and this is where the leaves are going

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.809 
and this is where the leaves are going
to<00:03:20.060> come<00:03:20.239> off<00:03:20.590> next<00:03:21.590> year<00:03:21.919> so<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.639> hopefully

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
to come off next year so that hopefully

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.020 
to come off next year so that hopefully
we'll<00:03:23.180> get<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.359> good<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.810> good<00:03:24.260> crop<00:03:24.849> more<00:03:25.849> about

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
we'll get a good a good crop more about

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.080 
we'll get a good a good crop more about
that<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.299> second<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.400> most<00:03:28.519> important

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
that in a second so the most important

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.430 
that in a second so the most important
thing<00:03:29.239> having<00:03:29.540> salt<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:30.049> for<00:03:30.199> a<00:03:30.229> couple<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
thing having salt it for a couple of

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.050 
thing having salt it for a couple of
days<00:03:30.530> because<00:03:30.769> these<00:03:30.979> dry<00:03:31.250> out<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.430> quickly

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
days because these dry out so quickly

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.909 
days because these dry out so quickly
and<00:03:32.629> once<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.019> dried<00:03:33.260> out<00:03:33.290> there<00:03:33.650> really

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
and once it dried out there really

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.089 
and once it dried out there really
difficult<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.549> get<00:03:34.699> going<00:03:34.879> again<00:03:35.979> we're<00:03:36.979> going

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
difficult to get going again we're going

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.240 
difficult to get going again we're going
to<00:03:37.159> part<00:03:37.430> them<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.870> wounded<00:03:39.319> one<00:03:39.530> we're<00:03:40.099> going

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
to part them the wounded one we're going

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.869 
to part them the wounded one we're going
to<00:03:40.340> plant<00:03:40.639> in<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.780> box<00:03:41.959> under<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:43.310> healthy

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
to plant in a box under the healthy

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.789 
to plant in a box under the healthy
looking<00:03:44.150> one<00:03:44.329> we're<00:03:44.930> going<00:03:45.079> to<00:03:45.169> plant<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.739> the

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
looking one we're going to plant in the

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:53.210 
looking one we're going to plant in the
ground<00:03:46.549> so<00:03:47.269> good<00:03:48.079> sharp<00:03:48.379> knife

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.370 

and<00:03:53.820> quite<00:03:54.060> literally<00:03:54.570> we're<00:03:55.080> going<00:03:55.260> to

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
and quite literally we're going to

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
and quite literally we're going to
simply<00:03:55.980> cut<00:03:56.960> right<00:03:57.960> down<00:03:59.120> here<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.280> we

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
simply cut right down here so that we

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.500 
simply cut right down here so that we
have<00:04:04.100> then<00:04:05.100> that's<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.400> attached<00:04:06.090> it'll<00:04:06.390> be

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
have then that's just attached it'll be

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.600 
have then that's just attached it'll be
fine<00:04:06.890> look<00:04:07.890> at<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:09.590> stem<00:04:10.590> work<00:04:10.800> on<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.100> inside

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
fine look at the stem work on the inside

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.680 
fine look at the stem work on the inside
of<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.860> plant<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.070> hollow<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:15.360> see<00:04:15.540> that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
of the plant is hollow you see that

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.229 
of the plant is hollow you see that
actually<00:04:16.620> earth<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.880> middle<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
actually earth in the middle of the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.670 
actually earth in the middle of the
plant<00:04:18.570> that's<00:04:20.510> filled<00:04:21.510> up<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.780> spaces<00:04:22.049> inside

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
plant that's filled up the spaces inside

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.840 
plant that's filled up the spaces inside
there<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:24.740> we'll<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.890> new<00:04:26.070> vascular<00:04:26.640> tissue

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
there and we'll get new vascular tissue

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.450 
there and we'll get new vascular tissue
between<00:04:27.150> here<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.710> bullet<00:04:29.010> or<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.190> first

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
between here and the bullet or the first

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.430 
between here and the bullet or the first
thing<00:04:29.700> we<00:04:29.790> want<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.030> do<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.930> we're<00:04:31.170> going<00:04:31.350> to

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
thing we want to do is we're going to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.300 
thing we want to do is we're going to
plant<00:04:31.770> this<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:33.210> one<00:04:33.480> you<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.140> see<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:34.560> it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
plant this this one you can see that it

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.220 
plant this this one you can see that it
got<00:04:35.550> rotted<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.090> I'll<00:04:36.180> trim<00:04:36.480> most<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:36.990> away

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
got rotted so I'll trim most of it away

get rid of our water now this bot simply
contains<00:04:55.889> good<00:04:56.889> quality<00:04:57.520> compost<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:59.370> it's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
contains good quality compost and it's

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.100 
contains good quality compost and it's
had<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.580> bit<00:05:00.759> of<00:05:00.789> mineral<00:05:01.330> well-rotted<00:05:01.960> manure

had a bit of mineral well-rotted manure

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.379 
had a bit of mineral well-rotted manure
thrown<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.919> when<00:05:03.490> we're<00:05:03.610> burying<00:05:03.909> that<00:05:04.120> one<00:05:04.270> in

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
thrown it when we're burying that one in

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.249 
thrown it when we're burying that one in
the<00:05:04.479> ground<00:05:04.629> in<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:04.930> moment<00:05:05.289> we're<00:05:05.470> going<00:05:05.710> to

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
the ground in a moment we're going to

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.960 
the ground in a moment we're going to
added<00:05:08.259> quite<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:08.860> bit<00:05:09.190> of<00:05:09.370> manure<00:05:09.669> to<00:05:09.879> the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
added quite a bit of manure to the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.879 
added quite a bit of manure to the
bottom<00:05:10.270> of<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.539> hole<00:05:11.199> so<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.470> that's<00:05:11.680> going

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
bottom of the hole so that that's going

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.520 
bottom of the hole so that that's going
to<00:05:11.949> go<00:05:12.099> really<00:05:12.340> really<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.479> this<00:05:13.599> is<00:05:13.810> simply

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
to go really really and this is simply

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:23.399 
to go really really and this is simply
going<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.750> completely<00:05:16.750> buried

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409

so<00:05:24.069> that<00:05:24.219> there<00:05:24.399> is

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
so that there is

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.460

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.100 
none of it showing and we're going to
put<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:28.980> in<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.760> cool<00:05:30.030> greenhouse<00:05:31.850> roundabout

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
put this in a cool greenhouse roundabout

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.500 
put this in a cool greenhouse roundabout
