00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I was four years old I don't really know

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.780 
I was four years old I don't really know
anything<00:00:09.570> else<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.590> life<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:11.429> work

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
anything else it's my life it's my work

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.749 
anything else it's my life it's my work
it's<00:00:12.480> my<00:00:12.690> hobby<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.860> everything<00:00:14.190> combined

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
but I think the most special thing about

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.070 
but I think the most special thing about
fishing<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.180> basically<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.810> wide

understand or remember and it's gone
away<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.500> from<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.220> idea<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.850> angling<00:01:51.659> was
