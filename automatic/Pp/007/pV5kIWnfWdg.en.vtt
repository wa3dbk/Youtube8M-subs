00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
so I've been asked about harvesting

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.170 
so I've been asked about harvesting
basil<00:00:26.700> specifically<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.700> basil<00:00:29.700> is<00:00:29.850> a<00:00:29.880> great

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
basil specifically and basil is a great

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.550 
basil specifically and basil is a great
crop<00:00:30.450> it's<00:00:30.780> a<00:00:30.870> really<00:00:31.080> high<00:00:31.260> dollar

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
crop it's a really high dollar

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.230 
crop it's a really high dollar
high-value<00:00:32.279> crop<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.820> lot<00:00:32.970> of<00:00:33.000> different

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
high-value crop in a lot of different

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.170 
high-value crop in a lot of different
areas<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.980> if<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.250> kind<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.030> getting

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
areas and if you're kind of just getting

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.210 
areas and if you're kind of just getting
into<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> commercial<00:00:36.960> growing<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.980> even

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
into the commercial growing or if even

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.700 
into the commercial growing or if even
if<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.580> a<00:00:38.610> home<00:00:38.809> producer<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.290> great

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
if you're a home producer it's a great

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.229 
if you're a home producer it's a great
crop<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.130> grow<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.700> worth<00:00:41.880> a<00:00:42.059> lot

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
crop to grow because it's worth a lot

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
crop to grow because it's worth a lot
and<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.980> grow

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and it's really really easy to grow

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.780 
and it's really really easy to grow
so<00:00:45.500> harvesting<00:00:46.500> I'll<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> square<00:00:47.550> one

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
so harvesting I'll go to square one

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.020 
so harvesting I'll go to square one
should<00:00:48.390> always<00:00:48.809> happen<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.530> dawn<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.489> pre-dawn

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
should always happen at dawn or pre-dawn

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.030 
should always happen at dawn or pre-dawn
okay<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> reason<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> when

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
okay and there's a reason for that when

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.530 
okay and there's a reason for that when
you<00:00:53.100> come<00:00:53.280> through<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> night<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
you come through the night all the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.510 
you come through the night all the
plants<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:54.930> holding<00:00:55.290> their<00:00:55.440> water<00:00:55.710> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
plants are holding their water really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
plants are holding their water really
well<00:00:56.850> they've<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:57.960> good<00:00:58.170> body<00:00:58.470> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
well they've got really good body and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.270 
well they've got really good body and
there's<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.640> more<00:01:00.350> weight<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.800> okay

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
there's a lot more weight to them okay

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
there's a lot more weight to them okay
so<00:01:02.880> but<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> weight<00:01:04.020> thing<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so but it's not just a weight thing the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
so but it's not just a weight thing the
flavor<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.800> better<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.369> everything<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
flavor is better just everything is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.460 
flavor is better just everything is
better<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.869> morning<00:01:07.020> they've<00:01:07.290> gone

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
better in the morning they've gone

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
better in the morning they've gone
through<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.830> night<00:01:08.040> their<00:01:08.970> stall<00:01:09.450> mates<00:01:09.660> are

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
through the night their stall mates are

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
through the night their stall mates are
often<00:01:10.229> closed<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.920> before<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> Sun<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
often closed it's before the Sun is is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180 
often closed it's before the Sun is is
hitting<00:01:12.660> them<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> water<00:01:13.560> demand<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.040> really

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
hitting them and water demand is really

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.740 
hitting them and water demand is really
high<00:01:14.310> before<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:14.940> start<00:01:15.149> losing<00:01:15.300> water

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
high before they start losing water

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
high before they start losing water
during<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.140> day<00:01:16.550> so<00:01:17.550> that's<00:01:18.149> usually<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
during the day so that's usually the

during the day so that's usually the
time<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> harvest<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.649> fairly<00:01:20.310> early

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
early if possible and but you know if if

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
early if possible and but you know if if
you<00:01:48.510> have<00:01:48.690> orders<00:01:48.990> coming<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.350> during<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> day

that need to be filled that day

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.200 
that need to be filled that day
sometimes<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.189> worth<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:53.729> filling<00:01:54.090> them

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
sometimes it's worth just filling them

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.390 
sometimes it's worth just filling them
but<00:01:54.780> when<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.080> cut<00:01:55.350> basil<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.830> usually<00:01:56.159> take

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
but when we cut basil we usually take

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.140 
but when we cut basil we usually take
the<00:01:56.580> tips<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> most

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
them in bags we'll weigh em we'll take

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.140 
them in bags we'll weigh em we'll take
them<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.320> market<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> restaurant<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
them to market to the restaurant to you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.539 
them to market to the restaurant to you
know<00:02:18.269> whoever's<00:02:18.750> ordered<00:02:19.110> them<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:20.370> can

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
know whoever's ordered them and we can

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.789 
know whoever's ordered them and we can
usually<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:21.180> quite<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> bit<00:02:22.049> off<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.650> these

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
usually get quite a bit off of these

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.900 
usually get quite a bit off of these
towers<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> recommend<00:02:24.590> fairly<00:02:25.910> consistent

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
towers so I recommend fairly consistent

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.520 
towers so I recommend fairly consistent
and<00:02:27.030> constant<00:02:27.239> harvesting<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.110> can<00:02:28.320> as

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and constant harvesting if you can as

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.260 
and constant harvesting if you can as
you<00:02:28.799> can<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.700> massive

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
you can see this this you know massive

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.850 
you can see this this you know massive
towers<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.170> what

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
towers this is what

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.420 
towers this is what
twelve<00:02:35.190> towers<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.540> sixteen<00:02:37.320> towers<00:02:37.770> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
twelve towers here or sixteen towers and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.120 
twelve towers here or sixteen towers and
there's<00:02:38.610> probably<00:02:39.410> several<00:02:40.410> hundred<00:02:40.650> pounds

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
there's probably several hundred pounds

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.810 
there's probably several hundred pounds
of<00:02:41.580> basil<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.920> saleable<00:02:43.920> basil<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.670> what

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
of basil in here saleable basil and what

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.040 
of basil in here saleable basil and what
we<00:02:44.970> do<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.450> basically<00:02:45.780> cut<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:48.050> we

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
we do is we just basically cut that we

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.710 
we do is we just basically cut that we
just<00:02:49.230> cut<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:50.700> regular<00:02:51.120> basis<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.630> we

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
just cut that on a regular basis so we

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.500 
just cut that on a regular basis so we
cut<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.960> every<00:02:52.170> day<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:53.580> go<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.760> market<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.390> go

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
cut it every day to go to market to go

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.480 
cut it every day to go to market to go
to<00:02:54.600> certain<00:02:54.930> customers<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.250> kind<00:02:56.430> of

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
to certain customers and we just kind of

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.880 
to certain customers and we just kind of
let<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.790> grow<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.000> now<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.530> only<00:02:58.680> do

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
let it grow back now you can only do

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.220 
let it grow back now you can only do
that<00:02:59.040> for<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.520> long<00:02:59.810> if<00:03:00.810> you're<00:03:01.020> doing

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that for so long if you're doing

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.900 
that for so long if you're doing
complete<00:03:01.740> harvests<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.340> you're<00:03:02.490> cutting<00:03:02.790> it

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
complete harvests if you're cutting it

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.030 
complete harvests if you're cutting it
back<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.600> leaving<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.770> bit<00:03:04.920> of

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
back and leaving a little bit of

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.490 
back and leaving a little bit of
material<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.700> root<00:03:06.120> mass<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.690> part<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
material the root mass and part of the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.410 
material the root mass and part of the
stem<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.950> regrow<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.430> plant<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.240> do

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
stem to regrow that plant you can do

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.770 
stem to regrow that plant you can do
that<00:03:09.860> but<00:03:10.860> typically<00:03:11.280> if<00:03:11.820> we<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.390> we<00:03:12.540> only

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
that but typically if we do that we only

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.620 
that but typically if we do that we only
do<00:03:12.930> two<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.100> three<00:03:14.130> cuttings<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:15.270> two<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.570> three

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
do two to three cuttings at two to three

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.210 
do two to three cuttings at two to three
cuttings<00:03:16.080> it's<00:03:16.260> getting<00:03:16.500> woody<00:03:16.740> enough<00:03:17.040> it's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
cuttings it's getting woody enough it's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.130 
cuttings it's getting woody enough it's
getting<00:03:17.340> mature<00:03:17.760> enough<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.870> flavor

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
getting mature enough that the flavor

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.690 
getting mature enough that the flavor
changes<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.770> little<00:03:19.920> bit<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.220> becomes<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.580> little

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
changes a little bit it becomes a little

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.130 
changes a little bit it becomes a little
bit<00:03:20.790> more<00:03:21.000> bitter<00:03:21.240> it's<00:03:21.390> producing<00:03:21.840> more<00:03:21.990> of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
bit more bitter it's producing more of

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.530 
bit more bitter it's producing more of
kind<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.380> those<00:03:22.500> bitter<00:03:22.709> alkaloids<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.540> we

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
kind of those bitter alkaloids and we

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.240 
kind of those bitter alkaloids and we
don't<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:25.170> don't<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.709> as<00:03:25.890> much<00:03:26.070> our

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
don't we don't like that as much our

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.970 
don't we don't like that as much our
customers<00:03:26.670> don't<00:03:27.090> typically<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.500> we

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
customers don't typically like it so we

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.220 
customers don't typically like it so we
stick<00:03:29.190> with<00:03:29.220> nice<00:03:29.580> young<00:03:30.030> tender<00:03:30.690> shoots<00:03:30.930> like

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
stick with nice young tender shoots like

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.160 
stick with nice young tender shoots like
this<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.770> we'll<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.510> want<00:03:33.510> between<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.140> and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
this and we'll do want between one and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.020 
this and we'll do want between one and
three<00:03:34.320> cuttings<00:03:34.830> if<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.490> a<00:03:35.580> total<00:03:35.850> harvest

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
three cuttings if it's a total harvest

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.440 
three cuttings if it's a total harvest
or<00:03:36.390> basically<00:03:37.290> about<00:03:37.650> four<00:03:38.070> weeks<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:39.180> five

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
or basically about four weeks to five

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.000 
or basically about four weeks to five
weeks<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:40.050> cutting<00:03:40.890> constantly<00:03:42.620> for<00:03:43.620> market

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
weeks of cutting constantly for market

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.620 
weeks of cutting constantly for market
before<00:03:44.430> we<00:03:44.640> tear<00:03:44.940> everything<00:03:45.180> out<00:03:45.420> and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
before we tear everything out and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.370 
before we tear everything out and
replant<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.890> it's<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.820> great<00:03:48.120> crop<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.959> really

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
replant so it's a great crop it's really

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.920 
replant so it's a great crop it's really
nice<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.830> easy<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.130> harvest<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:51.390> don't<00:03:51.600> do<00:03:51.750> any

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
nice and easy to harvest we don't do any

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.110 
nice and easy to harvest we don't do any
rinsing<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.560> our<00:03:52.920> basil<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.459> comes<00:03:53.700> off<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
rinsing on our basil it comes off the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.229 
rinsing on our basil it comes off the
plant<00:03:54.360> nice<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.930> clean<00:03:55.519> because<00:03:56.519> we<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.120> know

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
plant nice and clean because we you know

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.850 
plant nice and clean because we you know
we're<00:03:57.390> not<00:03:57.510> we're<00:03:57.720> not<00:03:57.750> using<00:03:58.050> any<00:03:58.230> nasty

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
we're not we're not using any nasty

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.800 
we're not we're not using any nasty
pesticides<00:03:59.430> or<00:03:59.580> herbicides<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.239> we're

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
pesticides or herbicides and we're

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.030 
pesticides or herbicides and we're
growing<00:04:01.019> hydroponically<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.800> it's<00:04:01.920> not

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
growing hydroponically so it's not

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
growing hydroponically so it's not
really<00:04:02.280> dirty<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:04.200> goes<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.560> market<00:04:04.709> they'll

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
really dirty it goes to market they'll

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.970 
really dirty it goes to market they'll
rinse<00:04:05.519> it<00:04:05.730> wherever<00:04:06.540> we're<00:04:06.870> selling<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:07.800> we

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
rinse it wherever we're selling it so we

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.590 
rinse it wherever we're selling it so we
basically<00:04:08.310> cut<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.880> dry<00:04:09.720> put<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.600> bags

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600
