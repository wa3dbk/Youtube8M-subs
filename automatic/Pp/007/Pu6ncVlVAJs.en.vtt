with the balloons while riding opponent
but<00:00:34.800> ironically<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
but ironically this is actually not the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.790 
but ironically this is actually not the
best<00:00:36.420> way<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> defeat<00:00:36.989> them<00:00:37.200> I'm<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
best way to defeat them I'm going to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
best way to defeat them I'm going to
show<00:00:37.950> her<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.280> first<00:00:38.579> since<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
show her way first since it can be

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.580 
show her way first since it can be
difficult<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.930> most<00:00:40.140> likely<00:00:40.469> what

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
difficult and it's most likely what

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.420 
difficult and it's most likely what
you're<00:00:40.710> struggling<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.309> you're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you're struggling with if you're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.680 
you're struggling with if you're
watching<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.790> video<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> show

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
watching this video so I'm going to show

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.970 
watching this video so I'm going to show
it<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.590> indeed

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it so you can see that it is indeed

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
it so you can see that it is indeed
possible<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.390> red<00:00:45.539> light<00:00:45.719> appears<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
possible as the red light appears and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.229 
possible as the red light appears and
begins<00:00:46.559> depositing<00:00:47.160> aliens<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.059> want

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
begins depositing aliens around you want

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
begins depositing aliens around you want
to<00:00:48.300> take<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.629> look<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.110> mini-map<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
to take a look at your mini-map and the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
to take a look at your mini-map and the
aliens<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.250> appear<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.610> white<00:00:50.820> dots<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.180> your

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
aliens will appear as white dots on your

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
aliens will appear as white dots on your
map<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.020> confusing<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.739> it's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
map it's kind of confusing because it's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.430 
map it's kind of confusing because it's
the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.850> doors<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.960> also<00:00:55.170> white

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the same as the doors are also white

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
the same as the doors are also white
dots<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.829> map<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:56.940> note<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
dots on your map but just make note of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.549 
dots on your map but just make note of
these<00:00:57.329> starting<00:00:57.629> locations<00:00:58.079> every<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
these starting locations every time you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.799 
these starting locations every time you
defeat<00:00:58.890> an<00:00:59.039> alien<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.940> appear<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:00.629> at

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
defeat an alien it will appear back at

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
defeat an alien it will appear back at
its<00:01:00.930> starting<00:01:01.230> location<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.430> hasn't

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
its starting location so if it hasn't

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.179 
its starting location so if it hasn't
traveled<00:01:03.180> very<00:01:03.270> far<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.379> kill<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
traveled very far and you kill it it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.440 
traveled very far and you kill it it
will<00:01:05.339> only<00:01:05.489> move<00:01:05.700> back<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> little<00:01:06.090> bit

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
will only move back a little bit

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
will only move back a little bit
meanwhile<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> wait<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.890> while<00:01:08.100> for

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
meanwhile if you wait a little while for

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.550 
meanwhile if you wait a little while for
it<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.939> closer<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.960> kill<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it to get closer and then you kill it it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
it to get closer and then you kill it it
will<00:01:10.770> push<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> back<00:01:11.250> further<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.970> comparison

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
will push it back further in comparison

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510 
will push it back further in comparison
does<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.960> make<00:01:13.080> sense<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
does that make sense so because of this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
does that make sense so because of this
I<00:01:14.700> actually<00:01:14.909> recommend<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> wait<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> little

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
I actually recommend you wait a little

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.749 
I actually recommend you wait a little
while<00:01:16.380> before<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.860> begin<00:01:17.070> killing<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.580> so

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
while before you begin killing them so

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.190 
while before you begin killing them so
that<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> make<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.299> efforts<00:01:18.630> worthwhile

you're<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.680> sporadically<00:01:20.280> shooting<00:01:20.729> them

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you're just sporadically shooting them

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
you're just sporadically shooting them
and<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.060> panicking<00:01:21.630> oh<00:01:21.780> no<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> aliens<00:01:22.470> are

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and going panicking oh no the aliens are

and going panicking oh no the aliens are

this harder for yourself always work

this harder for yourself always work
your<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.110> clockwise<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.890> counter<00:01:29.130> clockwise

your way clockwise or counter clockwise
around<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> barn<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.420> take<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> slow<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
around the barn just take it slow and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.899 
around the barn just take it slow and
kill<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> time<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.610> mini<00:01:32.759> may

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
kill one at a time use your mini may

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
kill one at a time use your mini may
have<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.210> how<00:01:33.360> far<00:01:33.390> away<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
have to see how far away they are so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.480 
have to see how far away they are so
that<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.650> chase<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:34.979> down<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> gets

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that you can chase one down if it gets

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
that you can chase one down if it gets
too<00:01:35.579> close<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> believe<00:01:36.450> most<00:01:36.659> people<00:01:36.840> make

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
too close now I believe most people make

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600 
too close now I believe most people make
a<00:01:37.140> mistake<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.680> charging<00:01:38.040> opponent<00:01:38.369> around

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
a mistake of charging opponent around

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
a mistake of charging opponent around
and<00:01:38.850> killing<00:01:39.030> any<00:01:39.270> aliens<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.900> sight<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.619> end

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and killing any aliens in sight they end

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230 
and killing any aliens in sight they end
up<00:01:40.829> being<00:01:41.009> too<00:01:41.189> far<00:01:41.400> away<00:01:41.490> from<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> barn<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
up being too far away from the barn and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.609 
up being too far away from the barn and
as<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> result<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:42.869> can't<00:01:43.079> make<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.439> in

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
as a result they can't make it back in

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109 
as a result they can't make it back in
time<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> kill<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> ones<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.700> too<00:01:44.820> close

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
time to kill the ones that get too close

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.600 
time to kill the ones that get too close
as<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.530> riding<00:01:46.920> opponent<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> bit

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
as you can see riding opponent is a bit

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.130 
as you can see riding opponent is a bit
awkward<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> focus<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.780> moving<00:01:49.049> her

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
awkward you have to focus on moving her

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
awkward you have to focus on moving her
around<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:50.310> she<00:01:50.490> keeps<00:01:50.670> moving<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
around and because she keeps moving you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
around and because she keeps moving you
may<00:01:51.210> end<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.420> missing<00:01:51.750> an<00:01:51.869> alien<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.380> it's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
may end up missing an alien because it's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050 
may end up missing an alien because it's
difficult<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> turn<00:01:53.070> around<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> get

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
difficult to turn around when you get

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.010 
difficult to turn around when you get
sick<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> here's<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> trick<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
sick of it here's the trick to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
sick of it here's the trick to
completing<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:56.070> off<00:01:56.189> Epona<00:01:56.520> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
completing this get off Epona it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:57.920 
completing this get off Epona it's
really<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.540> simple

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
really that simple

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
really that simple
as<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> stopped<00:01:59.070> an<00:01:59.250> alien

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
as you can see here I stopped an alien

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.679 
as you can see here I stopped an alien
that<00:01:59.700> almost<00:02:00.000> reached<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> barn<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that almost reached the barn and I

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.120 
that almost reached the barn and I
didn't<00:02:00.930> mean<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> let<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.619> close<00:02:01.860> but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
didn't mean to let it get that close but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.889 
didn't mean to let it get that close but
it's<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> also<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.060> perfect<00:02:03.270> example<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it's this is also a perfect example of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.600 
it's this is also a perfect example of
what<00:02:04.049> I'm<00:02:04.140> trying<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.380> show<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
what I'm trying to show if you have the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
what I'm trying to show if you have the
bunny<00:02:05.759> hood<00:02:05.880> slap<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.450> since<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.840> mix

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
bunny hood slap it on since this mix

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.660 
bunny hood slap it on since this mix
it's<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.500> tad<00:02:07.799> easier<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.580> not

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it's just a tad easier but it's not

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.699 
it's just a tad easier but it's not
required<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.720> run<00:02:09.929> off<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.440> side<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
required and then run off to one side of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.050 
required and then run off to one side of
the<00:02:10.770> barn<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.190> ready<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.580> circle<00:02:12.000> around

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the barn and get ready to circle around

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.120 
the barn and get ready to circle around
again

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
again

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.380 
again
I personally<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:13.940> wait<00:02:14.060> until<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
I personally like to wait until the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.450 
I personally like to wait until the
aliens<00:02:14.690> get<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> little<00:02:15.200> closer<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:16.040> actually

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
aliens get a little closer this actually

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.100 
aliens get a little closer this actually
means<00:02:16.610> I'm<00:02:16.730> shooting<00:02:17.060> less<00:02:17.300> aliens<00:02:17.750> total

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
means I'm shooting less aliens total

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.780 
means I'm shooting less aliens total
because<00:02:18.350> they<00:02:18.470> appear<00:02:18.800> less<00:02:19.070> often<00:02:19.550> that's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
because they appear less often that's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.760 
because they appear less often that's
the<00:02:20.030> trick<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:20.990> also<00:02:21.110> makes<00:02:21.350> them<00:02:21.440> easier

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the trick so it also makes them easier

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.380 
the trick so it also makes them easier
to<00:02:21.800> hit<00:02:22.010> because<00:02:22.190> they're<00:02:22.610> closer<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.270> have

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
to hit because they're closer and I have

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.450 
to hit because they're closer and I have
less<00:02:23.570> distance<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:24.050> travel<00:02:24.170> once<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.190> start

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
less distance to travel once you start

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.650 
less distance to travel once you start
just<00:02:25.610> begins<00:02:25.910> circling<00:02:26.270> around<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> barn

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
just begins circling around the barn

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.030 
just begins circling around the barn
taking<00:02:27.080> aim<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.470> as<00:02:27.530> you'll<00:02:27.710> quickly<00:02:27.860> see

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
taking aim and as you'll quickly see

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.410 
taking aim and as you'll quickly see
when<00:02:28.490> you're<00:02:28.580> not<00:02:28.700> writing<00:02:28.820> opponent<00:02:29.330> it's

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
when you're not writing opponent it's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.910 
when you're not writing opponent it's
far<00:02:29.660> easier<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.080> snipe<00:02:30.350> them<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.770> don't

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
far easier to snipe them just don't

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.190 
far easier to snipe them just don't

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.010 
sure what it is about writing opponent I
mean<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.920> sounds<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.910> good<00:02:47.120> idea<00:02:47.240> but<00:02:47.510> it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
mean it sounds like a good idea but it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.840 
mean it sounds like a good idea but it
seriously<00:02:48.590> makes<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.160> much<00:02:49.190> harder

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
seriously makes this so much harder

seriously makes this so much harder

float along super loop or slow which is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.900 
float along super loop or slow which is
makes<00:04:06.140> them<00:04:06.350> incredibly<00:04:06.500> easy<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:07.790> that

I guess cream you must have found her
out<00:05:56.870> in<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.020> field<00:05:57.170> or<00:05:57.410> something<00:05:57.740> but<00:05:57.920> she

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
out in the field or something but she

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.530 
out in the field or something but she
looks<00:05:58.250> kind<00:05:58.460> of<00:05:58.490> out<00:05:58.640> of<00:05:58.670> it<00:05:58.850> I<00:05:59.060> suppose<00:05:59.420> I
