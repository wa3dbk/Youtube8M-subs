about<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> five

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
about a five

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.360 
about a five
because<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.140> haven't<00:02:13.350> worn<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.860> enough<00:02:14.190> to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
because I haven't worn it enough to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.220 
because I haven't worn it enough to
actually<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.210> able<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.510> tell<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.050> any

more<00:02:16.500> than<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> five<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.240> think<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:19.050> five<00:02:19.350> right

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
more than a five so I think a five right
