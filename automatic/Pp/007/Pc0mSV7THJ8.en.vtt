00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.570

 about bluetooth certificates and then 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.490
 As for the design of the device, then how 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.770
 he always excellent keyboard case 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.110

 Work characters on the keys are applied 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.119
 gray but this is a problem 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.250
 since they are quite contrasting and not 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.319
 different but since i was buying 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.410

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.929
 This review appeared so late as 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.720
 two months have passed due to the fact 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.509
 that I did not dare to pay 200 hryvnia for 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.240

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.090
 I found in Russian letters they cost only 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 only 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.790

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.290
 battery compartment and radio module 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.180
 on its right side is a button 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.549

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.709

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.390
 you can open the lid with a screwdriver 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.489
 or for example money on the bottom of the files 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.709

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.510
 let's summarize focus attention 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.790
 on the main pros and cons of this 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.470
 keyboard plus should be attributed nice 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.880

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.950
 apple product innovation 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.599

 connections implemented very high quality 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.180
 as well as the duration of work from 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.910
 battery 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.010
 the disadvantages include the ebru file 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.069
 dominoes are not always recognized by dominoes 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.889

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.109
 digital input on the other hand exactly 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.000
 due to the lack of digital decay 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.889
 we got a very compact device 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.709
 looking back at all of the above 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.690

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.799
