00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.950
 the materials that we need are what 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.260
 next the color trapillo that 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.900
 We want one crochet knitting 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.059
 trapillo and scissors we started the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.059
 is knotting 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.200
 and we make 15 chains 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.620
 once the 15 chains are done we do 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.090
 one more chain 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.160
 and we make 15 half points in the case of 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.199
 want a bigger basket we can 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.570
 make more chains at the beginning and we do 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.390
 a half point at all points of the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.559
 previous return 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.940
 As we have done 15 chains we will do 15 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.940
 half points 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.260
 once the 15 half points are made 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:26.200
 we make a chain we turn the fabric and 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.200
 We make 15 more half points 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.759
 and we are going to repeat laps with 15 media 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:48.539
 points until we have 10 laps of 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.539
 half points 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.950
 we already have the 10 laps that will be the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.500
 basis of the party we now make a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.050
 chain we turn the fabric 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.110
 and let's make a point in all 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.340
 points around the base outline 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.850
 but taking the back half of the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.850
 points 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:28.200
 let's remember a point in all the points 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.660
 of the base of the basket but taking the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.660
 half back of the points 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.489
 once we have gone around the whole 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.030
 basket join with a slipped point with 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.230
 the first chain we have made 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 at the beginning of this round 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.610
 we make a slip stitch and we already have 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.950
 the first round of the top 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.959
 of the beams depending on how high the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.819
 we want to do more or less 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.640
 turns 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.379
 of half points now in this case 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.439
 let's do six more laps of media 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.710
 points at all points of the turn 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:25.090
 previous 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.090
 remember every time we arrive 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.330
 to the chain of start we make a point 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.330
 slipped up a chain 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.050
 and we can continue with the return of 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.010
 half points 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.820
 in this case we are going to do 6 laps of 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.820
 half points 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.010
 once we have finished all the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.480
 turns of half points we only have 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:13.200
 that close with a slipped point 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.500
 we make a chain and we can cut 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.930
 we pull the thread and with the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.720
 help from the same crochet let's go 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:28.120
 losing this thread by the tissue 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.120
 and we already have the c is finished 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.280
 Y
