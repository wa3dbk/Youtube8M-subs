this one where the of on your pole this
one<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.540> push<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.710> easy<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.400> control<00:00:17.670> free

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
one you push so easy to control free

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380 
one you push so easy to control free
will<00:00:18.810> kit<00:00:19.080> which<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.340> change<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
year two wheel so it's very similar to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.929 
year two wheel so it's very similar to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
seller rater so you walk in place

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.080 
seller rater so you walk in place
whether<00:00:37.950> walked<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> place<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.790> adjust

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
whether walked in place you can adjust

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.630 
whether walked in place you can adjust
it<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.129> point<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> view<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.610> really

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
good it's because it's balanced sight is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
control the height of it yep and you've

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
control the height of it yep and you've
got<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.879> okay<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.570> will<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.140> sure<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
got this okay that will make sure if you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
got this okay that will make sure if you
have<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> heavy<00:00:53.789> tackle<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.690> not

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
have got a lot of heavy tackle it's not

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.540 
have got a lot of heavy tackle it's not
going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.170> break<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> depending

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
going to break this at all and depending

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
going to break this at all and depending
on<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.090> height<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.930> adjust<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
on your height you know just adjust it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.840 
on your height you know just adjust it
for<00:00:58.559> comfort<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.070> obviously<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> main

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
for comfort but obviously the main

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
for comfort but obviously the main
factories<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.629> free<00:01:00.840> wheels<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.620> takes<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> lot

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
factories are free wheels it takes a lot

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.670 
factories are free wheels it takes a lot
more<00:01:02.399> weight<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.989> makes<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> even<00:01:04.229> easier<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
more weight and makes it even easier I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.200 
more weight and makes it even easier I
guess<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.369> lot<00:01:05.580> easier<00:01:05.909> because

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
guess there's a lot lot easier because

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
guess there's a lot lot easier because
you<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> day<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.320> leave<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you in a day you can just leave it like

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
you in a day you can just leave it like
that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
that
and<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> topple<00:01:09.210> over<00:01:09.600> or

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and it's not going to topple over or

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.469 
and it's not going to topple over or
anything<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> lot

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
anything like that and so it's a lot

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
anything like that and so it's a lot
easier<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> control<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.380> again<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.710> someone

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
easier to control and again it's someone

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640 
easier to control and again it's someone
who's<00:01:14.010> got<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.430> poor<00:01:14.850> health<00:01:15.560> situation<00:01:16.560> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
who's got a poor health situation in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
who's got a poor health situation in
life<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.820> even<00:01:18.180> better<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.420> them

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
life this is even better for them

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
life this is even better for them
because<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.890> does<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because it does it all for you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.030 
because it does it all for you
without<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.540> yeah<00:01:21.900> well<00:01:22.259> another<00:01:22.590> great<00:01:22.799> bit

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
without that yeah well another great bit

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.120 
without that yeah well another great bit
of<00:01:23.070> kit<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.970> again<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:24.750> easy<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.860> the
