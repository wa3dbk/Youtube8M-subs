same power supply as the CV for which is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
same power supply as the CV for which is
where<00:00:36.629> we<00:00:36.719> get<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> nine<00:00:37.109> patterns<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
where we get the nine patterns from and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.849 
where we get the nine patterns from and
it<00:00:38.789> also<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.679> have<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
it also has on the back here we have a

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.649 
it also has on the back here we have a
high<00:00:41.070> pass<00:00:41.370> filter<00:00:41.789> and<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.999> pan<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.539> which

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
high pass filter and a pan on it which

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.619 
high pass filter and a pan on it which
we<00:00:42.809> actually<00:00:43.170> don't<00:00:43.289> have<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.589> the<00:00:43.679> CV<00:00:43.980> for

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
we actually don't have on the CV for

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
we actually don't have on the CV for
what's<00:00:45.629> different<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.109> it<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> CV<00:00:47.039> for

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
what's different about it and the CV for

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.290 
what's different about it and the CV for
is<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:49.819> transformer<00:00:50.819> that's<00:00:50.999> more<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
is it has a transformer that's more of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
is it has a transformer that's more of
the<00:00:51.390> size<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.839> like<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> c12<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> 251<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.609> it's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the size of like a c12 or a 251 so it's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
the size of like a c12 or a 251 so it's
a<00:00:53.819> smallest<00:00:54.300> transformer<00:00:55.109> with<00:00:55.260> at<00:00:55.409> sea

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
a smallest transformer with at sea

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.040 
a smallest transformer with at sea
before<00:00:55.649> has<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> large<00:00:56.640> transformer<00:00:57.179> like<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> 47

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
before has a large transformer like a 47

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.459 
before has a large transformer like a 47
or<00:00:58.140> something<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.979> it<00:00:59.339> also<00:00:59.519> has<00:00:59.699> a

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
or something like this and it also has a

or something like this and it also has a
miniature<00:01:01.469> pentode<00:01:02.010> tube<00:01:02.339> where<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> sea

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
miniature pentode tube where the sea

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.569 
miniature pentode tube where the sea
before<00:01:03.659> has<00:01:03.929> a<00:01:03.960> EF<00:01:04.620> eight<00:01:04.830> hundred<00:01:05.159> new<00:01:05.430> old

stock telefunken too but one of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.959 
stock telefunken too but one of the
things<00:01:07.680> that's<00:01:07.890> also<00:01:08.250> very<00:01:08.280> special<00:01:08.880> about

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
things that's also very special about

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.660 
things that's also very special about
this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> we've<00:01:09.990> includes<00:01:10.469> our<00:01:10.829> expanded<00:01:11.579> our

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this is we've includes our expanded our

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
this is we've includes our expanded our
manufacturing<00:01:12.270> capabilities<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.590> we

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
manufacturing capabilities and that we

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
manufacturing capabilities and that we
actually<00:01:13.950> created<00:01:14.460> tools<00:01:14.759> for<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
actually created tools for this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
actually created tools for this
microphone<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.079> we're<00:01:16.590> becoming<00:01:16.829> more<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
microphone so we're becoming more like a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.910 
microphone so we're becoming more like a
more<00:01:17.759> sophisticated<00:01:18.500> manufacturer<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
more sophisticated manufacturer and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.709 
more sophisticated manufacturer and
we're<00:01:20.070> able<00:01:20.219> to<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.149> much<00:01:21.420> lower

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
we're able to make this at a much lower

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.630 
we're able to make this at a much lower
cost<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.409> far<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> body<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.029 
talk about it and when we were hoping
for<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.869> come<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.289> say<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.679> sounds

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
for is they come back and say it sounds

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.279

almost<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.549> good<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> CV<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.539> but<00:01:51.960> actually

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
almost as good as a CV for but actually

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.450 
almost as good as a CV for but actually
what<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.500> found<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.039> came<00:01:53.189> back<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
what we found out is they came back and

what we found out is they came back and
said<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.850> sounds<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.689> good<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> see

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
said it sounds just as good as to see

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.660 
said it sounds just as good as to see
before<00:01:55.560> some<00:01:55.829> people<00:01:56.070> liked<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> better<00:01:56.490> than

here's the little brother of the c7 it's
to<00:02:45.320> see<00:02:45.530> one<00:02:45.740> it's<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.340> exact<00:02:46.760> same

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
to see one it's the exact same

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.760 
to see one it's the exact same
microphone<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> c7<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.260> only<00:02:48.470> difference

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
microphone as the c7 the only difference

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.200 
microphone as the c7 the only difference
being<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.280> fixed<00:02:49.610> cardioid<00:02:50.000> pickup

high pass filter in the same pan uses

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.010 
high pass filter in the same pan uses

from<00:02:57.170> am<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.040> also<00:02:58.520> has<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> internal<00:02:59.390> bias

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
from am I it also has the internal bias

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.970 
from am I it also has the internal bias
switch<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.410> change<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.800> bias

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
switch so you can change the bias

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.760

the are 99 from Mike tech this is

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.970 
the are 99 from Mike tech this is
actually<00:03:20.600> we<00:03:20.690> applied<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.050> a<00:03:21.230> patent<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:21.739> call

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
actually we applied for a patent we call

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.580 
actually we applied for a patent we call
it<00:03:22.100> an<00:03:22.190> auto<00:03:22.400> set<00:03:22.790> duel<00:03:23.540> mode<00:03:23.810> ribbon<00:03:24.200> mic<00:03:24.350> and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
it an auto set duel mode ribbon mic and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.530 
it an auto set duel mode ribbon mic and
what<00:03:24.770> we<00:03:24.890> mean<00:03:25.100> by<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:26.150> put<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.360> bunch

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
what we mean by that is we put a bunch

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.760 
what we mean by that is we put a bunch
of<00:03:26.600> prototypes<00:03:27.080> out<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.410> our<00:03:27.530> favorite

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
of prototypes out to our favorite

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.340 
of prototypes out to our favorite
engineers<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.670> Nashville<00:03:29.060> we<00:03:29.239> had<00:03:29.480> my<00:03:29.959> K<00:03:30.020> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
engineers in Nashville we had my K and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.510 
engineers in Nashville we had my K and
Mike<00:03:30.500> being<00:03:30.739> we<00:03:30.890> said<00:03:31.040> which<00:03:31.160> one<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.489> like

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
Mike being we said which one do you like

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.430 
Mike being we said which one do you like
better<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.120> they<00:03:32.690> said<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.050> know<00:03:33.170> we<00:03:33.290> like

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
better and they said you know we like

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.870 
better and they said you know we like
this<00:03:33.560> one<00:03:33.800> on<00:03:33.890> this<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.190> we<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.580> one<00:03:34.760> on

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
this one on this and we like this one on

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.340 
this one on this and we like this one on
this<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.330> basically<00:03:36.170> two<00:03:36.320> different

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
this so basically two different

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.070 
this so basically two different
microphones<00:03:36.890> one<00:03:37.280> had<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.489> sweet<00:03:38.120> transformer

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
microphones one had a sweet transformer

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.710 
microphones one had a sweet transformer
by<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.260> mi<00:03:39.800> for<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> very<00:03:40.640> vintage<00:03:41.060> classic<00:03:41.600> kind

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
by a mi for a very vintage classic kind

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.330 
by a mi for a very vintage classic kind
of<00:03:41.870> sound<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.410> other<00:03:42.560> one<00:03:42.770> was<00:03:42.890> inactive

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
of sound and the other one was inactive

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.910 
of sound and the other one was inactive
with<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.580> more<00:03:43.810> modern<00:03:44.810> kind<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.050> circuit<00:03:45.440> so

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
with the more modern kind of circuit so

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.470 
with the more modern kind of circuit so
since<00:03:46.160> everybody<00:03:46.520> said<00:03:46.730> they<00:03:46.760> look<00:03:46.970> like<00:03:47.120> both

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
since everybody said they look like both

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.080 
since everybody said they look like both
of<00:03:47.510> them<00:03:47.870> we<00:03:48.110> had<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.380> idea<00:03:48.560> mutually<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.489> bunch

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
of them we had the idea mutually a bunch

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.820 
of them we had the idea mutually a bunch
of<00:03:50.209> us<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.510> actually<00:03:50.660> try<00:03:51.020> to<00:03:51.050> put<00:03:51.350> both<00:03:51.530> sets

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
of us to actually try to put both sets

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.350 
of us to actually try to put both sets
of<00:03:51.920> electronics<00:03:52.489> in<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:52.970> that's

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
of electronics in there and that's

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.270 
of electronics in there and that's
exactly<00:03:53.540> what<00:03:53.989> we<00:03:54.080> did<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:54.770> basically<00:03:55.190> you

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
exactly what we did so basically you

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.010 
exactly what we did so basically you
have<00:03:55.430> both<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.760> active<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.450> passive

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
have both the active and the passive

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.960 
have both the active and the passive
electronics<00:03:57.680> here<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.100> all<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.580> need<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.850> do

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
electronics here and all you need to do

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.670 
electronics here and all you need to do
is<00:03:59.120> turn<00:03:59.360> on<00:03:59.420> phantom<00:04:00.110> power<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
is turn on phantom power and the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.110 
is turn on phantom power and the
microphone<00:04:01.130> automatically<00:04:01.700> switches<00:04:02.090> to

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
microphone automatically switches to

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.990 
microphone automatically switches to
active<00:04:02.660> mode<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.530> have<00:04:03.680> two<00:04:03.920> voices<00:04:04.280> great

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
active mode so you have two voices great

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.640 
active mode so you have two voices great
sound<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.390> ribbon<00:04:05.720> mic<00:04:05.900> right<00:04:06.440> at<00:04:06.530> your

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
sound and ribbon mic right at your

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.260 
sound and ribbon mic right at your
fingertips<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:07.430> can<00:04:07.580> switch<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:07.850> easily

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270
