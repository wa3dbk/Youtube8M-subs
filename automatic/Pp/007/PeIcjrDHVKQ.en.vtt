00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.080
 in dread 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.570
 start-up and maintenance 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.730
 preventive engines in estimated power 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.070
 customer we appreciate the trust for 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 have bought a motor in power to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.240
 Here's how to put it 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.590
 underway and how to maintain it 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.480
 preventive start-up step 1 what 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.730
 first thing to check is that the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.850
 engine have oil the type of oil that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.770
 it is recommended is the sae 30 mono grade in 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.899
 the lower right side bears a 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.479
 bayonet remove it and through that hole 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.370
 introduce the oil the amount is 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:42.350
 depending on the engine according to the following 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.780
 5.5 motor table and 6.5 horsepower 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.420
 600 milliliters motor 8 horses 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 force and 9 horsepower one thousand 100 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.269
 milliliters engine 13 horsepower 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.269
 thousand 100 milliliters engine 15 horsepower 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.199
 force one thousand 100 milliliters motor 20 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.399
 horsepower thousand 400 milliliters 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 verify that the level marked on the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.970
 bayonet is the right one 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
 this action must be done with the engine 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.230
 placed horizontally if the level 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.120
 of oil is less than indicated 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.040
 guardian will activate protect his 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.530
 equipment and will not let the engine start 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 Otherwise, if the level is exceeded 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.760
 there is a possibility of evil 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 operation since the oil will pass to 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.590
 the combustion chamber and the carburetor 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.320
 causing bad engine performance 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 step 2 introduce gasoline into the tank 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 fuel is recommended to use gasoline 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
 new and clean it is important not to remove 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 the tank filter since its function 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.290
 is to retain particles that could cover 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 the carburetor step 3 place the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.870
 start switch in its position 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.970
 in step 4 open the stopcock of 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.120
 fuel to the right side such 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.520
 as indicated by your decal step 5 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.440
 when it is cold the engine should be 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 place the gray lever of the player 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.370
 towards the left side this is with the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 so that the carburetor reaches a 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.430
 richer mix of fuel and what 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.980
 help start step 6 in case of engine 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.350
 only with retractable pulley pull 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.630
 firmly the handle of the piola if your 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.520
 motor has electric gear drive 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.380
 with the key its starting position 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.750
 step 7 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.580
 once the engine has started, return the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.100
 gray lever of the player towards the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.140
 right side allowing air to pass through and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.300
 make an ideal mixture of gasoline and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.780
 air for the proper functioning of the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.790
 motor step 8 adjust with the lever of the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.920
 accelerator in the revolutions that 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.070
 require your equipment should not exceed 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 3600 revolutions per minute as 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.060
 runs the risk of damaging the engine shutting down 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.400
 the team step 1 return the lever of the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.160
 accelerator to the right side 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.060
 Step 2 Operate the motor switch 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.010
 towards your position or step 3 close the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.440
 fuel passage driving the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.330
 lever to the left side in case 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.310
 that the engine is not used in a 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.280
 Long period of time is recommended 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.950
 empty the tank fuel change 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.290
 of oil to the first 20 hours of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.870
 Work should change the oil 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.110
 new oil changes later 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.000
 must do every 100 hours 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.640
 preventive maintenance change 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.069
 filter in a normal environment clean the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.579
 air filter every 50 hours 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.480
 operation must be done 1 remove nut 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:34.349
 Butterfly 2 Remove filter cap 3 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.629
 remove the filter element 4 remove the 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.319
 filter sponge washing it with water and 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:43.709
 soap 5 introduce air under pressure from the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.049
 Internal part of the filter out 6 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.060
 Replace the sponge and rub the 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.459
 hands with a little oil to wet 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.499
 slightly the same for this to help 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.040
 to retain the particles from the environment of 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:58.169
 work 7 reposition the filter and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.379
 ensure that the lid is tightly closed 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.449
 with his nut butterfly note in case of 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.030
 environments with a lot of dust make this 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:08.189
 operation every 10 working hours the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.949
 engine will not work properly if the 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.680
 air filter is saturated change by 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:16.560
 new filter every 100 hours change of 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.900
 spark plug every 100 hours and it should be changed 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.449
 the spark plug using the tool that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.349
 Calibration is included in each equipment 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.900
 of the spark plug should be from 0.7 to 0.8 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.790
 millimeters the correct maintenance of 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.190
 your engine will ensure a long 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.080
 lifespan the do not carry out these 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.570
 recommendations can affect the
