 brand new unboxing today I present to you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 the last but use of this boxing series 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.490
 which is hell that the mans that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.780
 honestly it pokes me a little more 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 just for this cover really 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.510
 really flamboyant but because it is a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.490
 mouse with many programmable keys e 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.320
 so it's great for use for ad 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.410
 example is not even which I want good 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 kraft story metin maybe put nokia 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 few skills we see macro pro who 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.329
 then addressed to an audience that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.670
 uses multiplayer macros a lot and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.239
 we also have an internal memory of 128 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.620
 k let's take it back if there's any 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.950
 information 11 programmable buttons 9 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.210
 sorry 128 that beats memory for 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.890
 the macros various keys that the us inserts 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.460
 cm storm ergonomic design fu speed usb 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.739
 in the evening from the case in gold at least so 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.430
 I think I would like to make a movie, let's open the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.430
 package 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.260
 we open the package I said 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.060
 so indeed first let's see if there is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 state depend on the interior 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.729
 as you know I need from the top of the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.729
 mouse we live three buttons 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.900
 another that I do not see we color all 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.200
 options all the features 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.479
 here the sensor are spied 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 features do interest 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.940
 let's open this gem right away 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 finds around 40 euros around 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.180
 the offer also on the 30 35 is perhaps one 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.369
 of the few if not the only mouse in which 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.350
 we also find a driver disk 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.820
 inside, however , I recommend it 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.910
 always download the latest from the site 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.720
 internet sim store.com we scroll the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.560
 guarantee and here in manaus we remove the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 practical and on the whole and movable we have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.239
 mouse small pressure on the carton 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.390
 to remove the wires now as they have 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:35.720
 anticipated is gold plated 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.720
 let's get close to the cardboard immediately 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.560
 so far the cable is covered in fabric 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.920
 so they will come to avoid they will come to 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.010
 miss those uncomfortable events where the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.599
 travo services and it is difficult then to pull it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.370
 we talk about the mouse are not present 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.319
 weights with we cover the mats 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:11.500
 rubberized pipidine rubberized we enjoy the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:14.680
 sensor the socket is more than good one 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.930
 what i just noticed is that maybe the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.209
 back area does not go to perfectly 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.180
 fill the palm this could create 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.310
 a problem because he didn't know the mouse 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.459
 and it should be said worn used with the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.390
 lower part that adheres to the palm 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.549
 uses of this type are not of the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.690
 all advisable because they lead to 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.670
 pains ligaments and various wheel stuff 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.790
 very large like that of the king with what it is 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.910
 very much appreciated not only by me but 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.630
 from everyone a nice wide wheel does 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.639
 always comfortable 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.730
 here we have switches for dpa and dpi 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:04.510
 the key to change the profile 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.859
 now i connect it to your computer so you 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.950
 I also show the LEDs 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.989
 because here are the numbers 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.340
 you probably see them though but 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.680
 the illuminati who not theoretically 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.590
 should be ready use them 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.829
 even if you install the drivers and we will 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.829
 let's try 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.580
 I think I'll use this as a mouse 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:31.259
 my main then we see logo it is 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.289
 also seen the lights up we try the 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:38.300
 front wheel we have two other LEDs 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.300
 revealed by the guide therefore they seem 4 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:47.460
 very nice the Czech front very well 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.129
 here I must say the ball indicated we are 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.370
 in profile one so that we have profile 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.370
 dpi 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.400
 ok so we have it instead 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.870
 the lighting we activate we deactivate 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.069
 the front LEDs change cooperation a 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:13.610
 this and we turn the logo off and on 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:17.129
 we put it in pulse mode ok 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.379
 this isn't boxing so I'm having 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:24.529
 produced with you here in the car 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:27.479
 we have three programmable keys 1 2 and 3 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:30.900
 and here there are two small points 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.909
 very useful for example for those who play 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.169
 even at fps I know I said it is 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:39.690
 indicated for mmo users however this 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.330
 can be used as a rapid fire a 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.069
 in sentinels mans 2 we have this that 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.009
 indicated as rapid fire ie you are 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.860
 here the prizes so however sincerely 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.190
 I think a little of this is more useful 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.680
 guy 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.440
 this way i'll shoot 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.900
 normally I do this and that is the p file 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.990
 for example the macros that shovel silk and 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.580
 various stuff 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.129
 well possibly in the future I will also do 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.250
 a video regarding the 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.550
 macro and management program but 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.029
 for this unboxing is everything for the siam 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.740
 storm hell is also all here at one 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.089
 road so that it has not yet been 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.089
 extremely fine 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.479
 I greet you all bye bye
