00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.980
 but how about hayward friends are 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.370
 welcome once again to one of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 this year's guides as you know there was a 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.770
 voting system in a previous video 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 where we put several professions the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.880
 winners were alchemy and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.770
 herbalism so let's try to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 make a super fast guide is super 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.530
 easy that five chapters or less 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.829
 we managed to climb the profession in time 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.590
 real is going to be estimated in two days or such 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.210
 less time if it applies so good 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's start our guide 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.879
 alchemy but for that as all the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 world knows 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.739
 we need a lot of plants and then 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 we 're going to get that on this trip 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.489
 so we started with this guide 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.769
 herbalisty let's start in the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.030
 deaf area still deaf good 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.230
 friends, I'm sorry 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.910
 the first dots from 1 to 75 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.210
 you're going to have to go up on your own 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 account and then you can follow this this 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.860
 guide later on let's continue with 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.960
 neutral maps where they can go now and 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.540
 alliance to be able to raise the profession 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 so just start our route 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 and we are going to put the fastest way 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.900
 as you already know in the previous videos 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 like the quick so it does not get too 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.770
 long this video 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.350
 these areas are very good for 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.260
 getting too much silver leaf and flower 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 peace we are also going to annex that although 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.780
 there are very few behind but also 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.190
 we can find the ground root for 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.290
 be able to climb the profession do not forget 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.120
 buy their for sight that they can 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 get anywhere where 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.020
 they sell material if you're from the alliance 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.910
 Well, here and remove from the golden village 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.820
 in this area you can buy your for the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.910
 proof is that you have your little stick we can 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.710
 begin our route this route is going to be 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.130
 one of the simplest because despite 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.560
 that it is an area close to for 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 alliance is a neutral zone for all 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.300
 the partners of the alliance can reach and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.850
 accessing this area very easy is a 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.780
 area full of plants with two turns in 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.880
 this area three turns something a lot 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.620
 you can not find plants or people and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.480
 also that the profession is going up 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.090
 well, it's going to be three laps but if 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 you are alone in one hour of the night 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.270
 Well, it's going to be super easy to follow 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 this guide we need around 100 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.400
 plants of both factions but let's 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.739
 also need another one called root 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.140
 of earth as I said this root the who 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.910
 find out of their houses way but I 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.160
 I will indicate exactly the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 position of your account in each one for 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.540
 that suffer it so much looking for so much 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.880
 back through this guide for this route more 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.570
 what on the screen should be 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.519
 appearing the map of the route goes to 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.190
 be a while and then go to 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.739
 disappear so put him on pause or else 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.970
 put in the pei do not do anything 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.370
 but copy this photo 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.500
 once they have then they can start 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.210
 your day memorize as well as the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.870
 memorizing memories in the zones 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.460
 that we are going to go by and then nothing is going 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.280
 to get a good material and we're going 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.260
 to be able to climb the profession very fast 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750
 very very useful what takes longer in 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.640
 climb alchemy is not just solver 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.850
 herbalist since we need 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.550
 too many plants because in itself having 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 the facility of alchemy plants is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.360
 very very very easy so let's go to 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.910
 take the first round in this area as 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.920
 you can see here we find in the wake of 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.660
 earth and well then later I'll 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.910
 to explain more about the areas where 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.459
 you can find are three or four zones 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.610
 where we can find only this one 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.570
 material and the good thing is that it reappeared 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.190
 2003 you are in one and you go to the next and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.010
 then the next the other and appeared 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.810
 and so on then it's a route 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.170
 infinite where you can get the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.450
 material very very fast yes yes if you 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.610
 you are changing a place a flower or what 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.470
 what do you want if it's going to take longer I do not know 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.600
 what's up with the system I do not know if it's 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.460
 detected that but if you stay where 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.550
 the material will appear 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.260
 much more than usual, if not 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.390
 you were there then I recommend you 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.510
 that you do the rotation quietly without 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.240
 hurry because if not good then graze 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.960
 weapons involved by changing 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.590
 compose the drums almost in half 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.229
 of the rotation and we took 21 dots and 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.020
 we started on 1 it is very easy there 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.849
 too many plants the rotation that 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.490
 I'm checking does not indicate the position 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.710
 exactly where they are the plants but 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.500
 indicates a place by an approximate where 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.030
 they are going to be why they must activate their 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.400
 look for plants because while they go 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.130
 flying around that area the king is going to 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.860
 detect and you will go down 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.389
 where are you going to find these and these 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.259
 plants not like I said at the beginning 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.539
 we only found flower behind and leaf 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.159
 banana and ground root that are the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.599
 first materials to climb alchemy 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:11.699
 from 1 to 75 if I'm not wrong if I eat 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.430
 you can see we've finished the rotation 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.940
 we finished 28 dots nothing wrong in one 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.349
 simple easy first round and then 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.000
 let's try to make everything simple 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.370
 same as the engineering guide in 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.900
 engineering a lot of people have spent there 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.770
 sending messages by 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.110
 by impulse mailboxes where they have gone very 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.449
 alright so three times two more laps 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.240
 and they will have 58 points 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:43.169
 good makes a note we have our 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.779
 second round we have 47 points and for 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.339
 raise the kilo we need the root well 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.900
 that I 'm going to edit the positions 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:51.089
 where will they be so they go 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.159
 putting cause and go memorized 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.159
 to be here here 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.470
 here 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.600
 ready to place I hope now we already 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.150
 given but as I want later on in 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.370
 a second round I'm going to close them with 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.290
 a little circle where they will be 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.840
 I can also give them exactly 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.580
 coordinates and like but well I think 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.990
 which is better is closing those with a 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.540
 circle in the block almost followed more 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:25.870
 and with coordinates we will need 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:27.910
 around 60 40 why not many 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.820
 so good let's continue with our 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:37.350
 rotation so good here goes here 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:40.830
 where I am here here my team well 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.740
 pause well lath we continue a 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.289
 third round more and we see in what we 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.240
 we are 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:50.539
 the guys we took third round 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:55.309
 we get around 63 plants 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:58.039
 team see that it 's 12 22 stacks and 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:59.719
 here is one of 3 and here is the third 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.629
 ground root stack 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:04.939
 we get 63 in an easy way there's no 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.619
 many problems of getting it as you 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.569
 continue if they rotate between one and another 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:10.939
 it's going to be easy to get one time 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.490
 having we will be able to upload our 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:15.889
 profession of kenia very fast so 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.719
 see you in the next chapter or more 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.240
 well in the alchemy chapter where 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:23.059
 We will serve the profession we were 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.669
 in 58 points and later we will see 

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:28.899
 a trick to climb faster see you 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.899
 to the app 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.880
 i 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.220
 Y
