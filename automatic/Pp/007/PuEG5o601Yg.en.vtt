with<00:01:04.860> some<00:01:05.159> things<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.519> found<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
with some things I found around the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.460 
with some things I found around the
house<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:08.090> I've<00:01:10.460> actually<00:01:11.460> I've<00:01:11.880> already

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
house so I've actually I've already

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
house so I've actually I've already
antiqued<00:01:13.470> these<00:01:14.159> oxidized<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> can

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
antiqued these oxidized so you can

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.450 
antiqued these oxidized so you can
better<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> texture<00:01:19.009> see<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.310> hold

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
better see the texture see if I can hold

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.899 
better see the texture see if I can hold
that<00:01:20.520> closer<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.700> little

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that closer so this is just a little

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
that closer so this is just a little
coin<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.990> textured<00:01:25.770> copper<00:01:26.759> coin<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
coin that I textured copper coin that I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
coin that I textured copper coin that I
textured<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.939> ball<00:01:30.509> peen<00:01:30.540> hammer<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.540> end

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
textured with a ball peen hammer the end

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.859 
textured with a ball peen hammer the end
of<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:38.280> chasing<00:01:38.670> hammer<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> that's

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of this chasing hammer here and that's

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.760

hard steel wire that I just sort of been
up<00:03:13.269> into<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:14.100> funky<00:03:15.100> shape<00:03:17.010> laid<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.250> top<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
up into a funky shape laid it on top and

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.670 
up into a funky shape laid it on top and
using<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.320> plain<00:03:20.530> old<00:03:21.090> household<00:03:22.090> hammer

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
using just a plain old household hammer

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:31.520 
using just a plain old household hammer
hammer<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:24.010> there

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.600 

now<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.310> sort<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.880> feather<00:03:33.530> shape<00:03:34.550> is<00:03:35.550> a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
now this sort of feather shape is a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.449 
now this sort of feather shape is a
combination<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:37.530> grungy<00:03:37.950> hammer<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.800> a

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
combination of the grungy hammer and a

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.760 
combination of the grungy hammer and a
chisel<00:03:42.050> tip<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.080> know<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.440> can

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
chisel tip and that I you know you can

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.770 
chisel tip and that I you know you can
see<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> u.s.<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.790> can<00:03:47.819> add<00:03:48.150> some<00:03:48.420> really

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
see a u.s. you can add some really

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.740 
see a u.s. you can add some really
really<00:03:49.020> fun<00:03:49.350> texture<00:03:49.739> with<00:03:50.069> that<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.750> I'd

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
really fun texture with that and I'd

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.600 
really fun texture with that and I'd
actually<00:03:51.930> probably<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.160> more<00:03:53.370> on

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
actually probably like to do more on

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.500 
actually probably like to do more on
this<00:03:53.730> one<00:03:54.000> but<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:55.819> polished<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:56.910> up<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.300> and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
this one but I polished it up and and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.449 
this one but I polished it up and and
stuff<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.500> show<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.770> today<00:03:59.010> but<00:03:59.370> i'll

stuff to show you today but i'll

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.740 
stuff to show you today but i'll

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
actually probably go back and do a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.040 
actually probably go back and do a
little<00:04:00.989> bit<00:04:01.110> more<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.560> later<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:03.950> this

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
little bit more on that later on this

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.540 
little bit more on that later on this
here<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> flathead<00:04:07.560> screwdriver<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.739> i

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
here is a flathead screwdriver and i

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
just did the same thing just pounded it

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.710 
just did the same thing just pounded it
in<00:04:15.079> so<00:04:16.079> um<00:04:17.480> that's<00:04:18.480> that's<00:04:19.410> about<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.209> now<00:04:21.209> some

while<00:04:26.400> we're<00:04:26.550> here<00:04:26.700> talking<00:04:27.169> i<00:04:28.250> started<00:04:29.250> out

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
while we're here talking i started out

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.990 
while we're here talking i started out
by<00:04:30.120> annealing<00:04:30.630> my<00:04:30.810> metal<00:04:31.139> on<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.940> torch<00:04:32.940> to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
by annealing my metal on the torch to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.659 
by annealing my metal on the torch to
make<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.450> nice<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.600> soft<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.040> received<00:04:35.550> the

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
make it nice and soft so it received the

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.710 
make it nice and soft so it received the
texture<00:04:36.229> better<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.680> when<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.280> start<00:04:41.460> out<00:04:41.729> go

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
texture better so when you start out go

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.080 
texture better so when you start out go
ahead<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.169> aneel<00:04:43.410> your<00:04:43.669> Neil<00:04:44.669> your<00:04:44.850> peace

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
ahead and aneel your Neil your peace

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.719 
ahead and aneel your Neil your peace
with<00:04:45.120> your<00:04:45.479> torch<00:04:46.039> get<00:04:47.039> it<00:04:47.130> nice<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.340> glowing

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
with your torch get it nice and glowing

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.110 
with your torch get it nice and glowing
red<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:49.520> anneal<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.720> now<00:04:52.669> this<00:04:53.669> is<00:04:53.820> also<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
red and anneal it now this is also the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.779 
red and anneal it now this is also the
opportunity<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:58.620> want<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.010> use<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.460> usually

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
opportunity you want to use I usually
