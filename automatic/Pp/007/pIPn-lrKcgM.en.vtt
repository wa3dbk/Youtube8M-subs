obviously<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.489> wasn't<00:03:25.670> much<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.120> contender

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
obviously it wasn't much of a contender

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.479 
obviously it wasn't much of a contender
there<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.959> don't<00:03:27.019> see<00:03:27.350> this<00:03:28.010> film<00:03:28.280> being

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
there and I don't see this film being

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.070 
there and I don't see this film being
much<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.940> contender<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.420> think<00:03:29.630> March<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:29.989> a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
much of a contender I think March was a

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.960 
much of a contender I think March was a
great<00:03:30.260> release<00:03:30.560> date<00:03:30.860> for<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.220> because<00:03:31.730> I

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
great release date for it because I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.940 
great release date for it because I
think<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:32.600> gonna<00:03:32.720> have<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.930> hard<00:03:33.170> time<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.769> it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
think it's gonna have a hard time of it

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.729 
think it's gonna have a hard time of it
both<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.790> audiences<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:36.530> know<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
both with audiences and you know the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.500 
both with audiences and you know the
industry<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.280> terms<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.730> awards<00:03:38.090> circuit

industry in terms of the awards circuit
I<00:03:38.920> also<00:03:39.920> surprised<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.519> he<00:03:40.579> wouldn't<00:03:40.790> reteam

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
I also surprised that he wouldn't reteam

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.360 
I also surprised that he wouldn't reteam
with<00:03:41.150> Daniel<00:03:41.600> Bruhl<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:42.140> love<00:03:42.620> Daniel<00:03:42.860> Bruhl<00:03:43.190> so

with Daniel Bruhl I love Daniel Bruhl so

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.759 
with Daniel Bruhl I love Daniel Bruhl so
much<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.820> film<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.570> rush<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.140> thought<00:03:45.620> he

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
much in that film and rush I thought he

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.259 
much in that film and rush I thought he
was<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.040> breakout<00:03:46.370> Talent<00:03:46.880> he<00:03:46.970> was<00:03:47.120> what

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
was the breakout Talent he was what

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.560 
was the breakout Talent he was what
really<00:03:47.390> made<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.930> film<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:49.670> know<00:03:49.790> Revit

really made that film you know Revit

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.660 
really made that film you know Revit
engines<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.709> he<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.130> has<00:03:52.280> really<00:03:52.489> got

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
engines and he just has really got

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.009 
engines and he just has really got
nothing<00:03:53.180> out<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.570> which<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.720> so

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
nothing out of it which is so

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.720 
nothing out of it which is so
disappointing<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.799> guess<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:55.130> guess<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.400> Fifth

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
disappointing I guess I guess the Fifth

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.880 
disappointing I guess I guess the Fifth
Estate<00:03:55.880> really<00:03:56.390> cooled<00:03:56.930> cooled<00:03:57.530> off<00:03:57.709> his

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
Estate really cooled cooled off his

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.650 
Estate really cooled cooled off his
reputation<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.820> Hollywood<00:03:59.239> which

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
reputation in Hollywood which

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.000 
reputation in Hollywood which
unfortunately<00:04:00.260> came<00:04:00.410> out<00:04:00.620> around<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.950> same

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
unfortunately came out around the same

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.130 
unfortunately came out around the same
time<00:04:01.489> as<00:04:01.730> Rush<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.600> really<00:04:02.930> feel<00:04:03.110> that

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
time as Rush but I really feel that

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.449 
time as Rush but I really feel that
Daniel<00:04:03.500> Bruhl<00:04:03.680> should<00:04:03.829> have<00:04:03.920> gotten<00:04:04.160> more<00:04:04.400> out

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
Daniel Bruhl should have gotten more out

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.819 
Daniel Bruhl should have gotten more out
of<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.910> film<00:04:05.180> but<00:04:05.840> Chris<00:04:06.019> Hemsworth<00:04:06.380> seems<00:04:06.680> to

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
of the film but Chris Hemsworth seems to

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.400 
of the film but Chris Hemsworth seems to
be<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.070> only<00:04:07.100> one<00:04:07.430> doing<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:08.090> semi<00:04:08.750> victory<00:04:09.200> lap

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
have to wonder what's the point of

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.340 
have to wonder what's the point of
making<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.820> movie<00:04:46.150> like<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.330> if<00:04:47.140> it's<00:04:47.290> not

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
making a movie like this if it's not

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.900 
making a movie like this if it's not
going<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.710> have<00:04:47.800> anyone<00:04:48.070> see<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.640> no<00:04:48.760> one's

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
going to have anyone see it and no one's

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.730 
going to have anyone see it and no one's
gonna<00:04:49.030> recognize<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.870> for<00:04:50.020> its<00:04:50.140> for<00:04:50.620> its

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
gonna recognize it for its for its

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.470 
gonna recognize it for its for its
achievements<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.460> do<00:04:51.760> think<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.150> looks<00:04:52.300> like<00:04:52.420> a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
achievements I do think it looks like a

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
before that's kind of interesting and

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.960 
before that's kind of interesting and
the<00:05:02.890> way<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.130> whales<00:05:03.310> coming<00:05:03.700> in<00:05:03.790> on<00:05:03.880> the

water that's pretty scary but then you
know<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.370> makes<00:05:06.520> me<00:05:06.700> think<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:06.910> you<00:05:07.150> know

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.400 
know it makes me think that you know
this<00:05:07.360> is<00:05:07.480> a<00:05:07.510> true<00:05:07.750> story<00:05:08.050> but<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.320> know

there's a similar true story with a

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
although I think he's pretty busy these

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.020 
although I think he's pretty busy these
days<00:05:20.170> cuz<00:05:20.530> clearly<00:05:20.650> he<00:05:20.920> realizes<00:05:21.610> nobody

not<00:05:47.830> with<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.010> kind<00:05:48.190> of<00:05:48.220> capabilities<00:05:48.820> we

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
not with the kind of capabilities we

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.790 
not with the kind of capabilities we
have<00:05:49.060> today<00:05:49.300> in<00:05:49.419> terms<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.750> filmmaking<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:50.590> I

have today in terms of filmmaking and I

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.110 
have today in terms of filmmaking and I
think<00:05:51.010> at<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.130> very<00:05:51.310> least<00:05:51.490> people<00:05:51.850> would<00:05:52.030> be

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
think at the very least people would be

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.030 
think at the very least people would be
like<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.480> know<00:05:52.600> what<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:53.020> should<00:05:53.560> see<00:05:53.740> Moby

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
like you know what I should see Moby

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.409 
like you know what I should see Moby
Dick<00:05:54.250> I<00:05:54.400> should<00:05:54.669> be<00:05:54.760> familiar<00:05:54.970> with<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.390> story

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
Dick I should be familiar with the story

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.940 
Dick I should be familiar with the story
and<00:05:55.780> I<00:05:55.870> sure<00:05:56.080> as<00:05:56.110> heck<00:05:56.380> don't<00:05:56.560> want<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.830> read

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
and I sure as heck don't want to read

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.260 
and I sure as heck don't want to read
the<00:05:57.070> book<00:05:57.220> I've<00:05:57.520> read<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:57.910> book<00:05:58.090> it's

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
the book I've read the book it's

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.730 
the book I've read the book it's
required<00:05:58.690> reading<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.169> believe<00:05:59.440> in<00:05:59.590> most

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
required reading I believe in most

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.080 
required reading I believe in most
educational<00:06:00.520> systems

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
educational systems

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.870 
educational systems
it's<00:06:01.690> obviously<00:06:02.290> classic<00:06:02.980> but<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.430> think<00:06:03.700> it's

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
it's obviously classic but I think it's

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.580 
it's obviously classic but I think it's
a<00:06:03.970> very<00:06:04.150> rich<00:06:04.390> classic<00:06:04.930> that<00:06:05.080> could<00:06:05.260> really

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
a very rich classic that could really

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.710 
a very rich classic that could really
benefit<00:06:06.430> from<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.730> good<00:06:06.850> adaptation<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:07.660> I

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
benefit from a good adaptation and I

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.210 
benefit from a good adaptation and I
think<00:06:07.930> that<00:06:08.080> seeing<00:06:08.590> based<00:06:08.860> on<00:06:09.010> what<00:06:09.100> I'm

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
think that seeing based on what I'm

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.370 
think that seeing based on what I'm
seeing<00:06:09.460> here<00:06:09.790> this<00:06:10.660> might<00:06:10.900> be<00:06:11.020> a<00:06:11.050> team<00:06:11.350> that

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
seeing here this might be a team that

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.710 
seeing here this might be a team that
could<00:06:11.740> do<00:06:11.980> it<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.640> just<00:06:12.669> if<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.419> were<00:06:13.570> the
