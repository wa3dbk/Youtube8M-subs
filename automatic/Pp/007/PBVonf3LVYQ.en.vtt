00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.820
 hello I have fans with message or jose 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:05.200
 techno fanatic dotcom and we're going to 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.209
 do the first unpack 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.810
 clock impressions maybe the polygon 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:13.230
 good from the company tokyo fly.com under 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.230
 the video 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.700
 as you can see open river and the box 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.490
 It has not kept me he has not kept me 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.830
 to be able to return watch 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.430
 comes from the company tokyo flash them 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.010
 characterize developing watches 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.070
 with unique designs and they are usually 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.260
 divisions limited to the nascent with 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 the card the user manual in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.760
 English and here you can see the clock 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.449
 How beautiful is made of wood 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.679
 have there your leather strap can see 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.000
 the legitimate and it can be a bit when 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.769
 you tell them today this but what 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.940
 difficult for the hour but it is not 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.430
 this case is simple in the watches of the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 Tokiyo flash company is characterized by 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 present us the time in different 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 forms but in this case it's fine 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.899
 simple and I 'll explain them to you but 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.909
 first I want to give you the 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.080
 specifications of this watch we are going to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.300
 remove the mini dad if I can find 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.690
 30 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.450
 and the sound finishes in the part of 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 back we will stop and then sda 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.080
 we go with the specifications of the clock 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.550
 maybe there is a web polygon that you are 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.740
 polygon good has the ability 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.270
 show us the time and date as 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.910
 it also has an alarm mode in the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.380
 lcd screen has back light 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.330
 so that in case we are in 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 the darkness we can see the work is 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.680
 Made of wood in most 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.660
 sandal the weight is 45 grams is 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 Water resistant to 3 tm this 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.110
 it means you can not submerge it until 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
 30 meters deep personally 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 I would not do it I know that this greater is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.020
 treated so that it is prevented from going to 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.790
 value but anyway anyway not 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.590
 I would only put in personally how he lives 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.540
 also the leather strap the battery 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.010
 replaceable and this has a time 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.020
 lasting more or less than two years in the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.360
 typical battery of this type of watches and 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.190
 It has a year warranty price 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.260
 of $ 139 and the company that what 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.180
 It distributed as you know estoqueÃ³ 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.580
 dotcom flashes below this well in the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.400
 description let's leave the link 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.290
 to see the time in the polygon guti well 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.910
 simple let's have 12 polygons in 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.470
 the outside and we're going to have 6 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.540
 triangles on the inside and a 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.570
 space in the middle that will give us 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.320
 also the simple minute for example in 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.840
 this moment is 11 and 28 minutes 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.260
 then there you can see that in 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.360
 the part of here is marked 11 and in the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.000
 part of here is marked showing 220 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.400
 and here we have the number 8 is 11 and 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.920
 28 now when we want to see the date 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.900
 let's go to the next space if you 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.060
 they're going to see that on the outside we 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.580
 will show the polygons to show the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.400
 month and the middle along with the triangles 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.370
 will show us the day then in this 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.410
 case we are September and how are we 8 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.180
 September is going to mark the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.060
 upper triangle we're going to have the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.100
 8 in the middle when we say it's 18 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.630
 then we are going to have in the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.980
 first marked triangle and here we go to 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.470
 have the 8 and that means it's the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.150
 September 18 we will also have 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.350
 a weapon mode in this case we 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.290
 we have placed the alarm for 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.780
 sound at 11 and 58 then that's how 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.850
 you are going to be able 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.680
 see her now in this watch in this 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.310
 moment we have placed the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.270
 alarm to this one you can see 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.400
 11 and 34 should be playing between 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.400
 seconds we will show here 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.280
 that are still 11 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.280
 and 33 let's wait a few seconds 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.050
 and you are listening then there 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.200
 we have the alarm and for that reason it is very 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.959
 simple the 1 and 2 to do is go to the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.330
 area of the gun we started this button 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.530
 higher 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.900
 and it's going to start to vibrate we're all going to 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.640
 for example the minutes and why we do 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.530
 here is to tighten and we will put the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.530
 number 5 or work that you want 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.720
 then we press here and that would be all the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.180
 they would have it ready to sound 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.110
 at 11 and 35 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.300
 one of the main features 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.490
 of the polygon boot is that it's made of 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.710
 wood we do not usually see watches with 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.480
 this material and all the flash then we 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.630
 presents the good poleman with wood 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.000
 sandalwood the other is the strap that is of 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.520
 legitimate leather that you can see 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.620
 legitimate leather and other advantages is 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.270
 that resists water I appreciate pretty the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.830
 watch is interesting and it's easy to see 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.020
 compared to other watches that the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.390
 company touch flash thus offers this 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.250
 here it is easy to see achieve a point that 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.550
 I could complain if it's the fact that 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.440
 when we are in front of light or light 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.150
 direct there let's see what it is 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.280
 reflects a lot and unfortunately we're not going 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.630
 to be able to see the time well 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.120
 but outside of it I can tell you that 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.969
 the watch is very nice and it is an icon 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.269
 the fact that it is made of wood 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.379
 and another connotation of this clock or in 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:15.539
 case you liked this watch 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.639
 maybe and polygons already know company that 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.139
 distributes and develops it is tokyoflash 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.229
 dotcom they have a 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.409
