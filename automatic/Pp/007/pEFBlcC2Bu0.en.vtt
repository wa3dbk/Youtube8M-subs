00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
hull to its original form let's find out

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.270 
hull to its original form let's find out
give<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.959> try<00:02:54.049> first<00:02:54.560> yeah<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:59.390> here<00:03:00.280> is

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
give that a try first yeah and here is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.520 
give that a try first yeah and here is
an<00:03:01.489> example<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.599> a<00:03:03.349> station<00:03:04.069> that's<00:03:05.000> made<00:03:05.530> of

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
an example of a station that's made of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.819 
an example of a station that's made of
