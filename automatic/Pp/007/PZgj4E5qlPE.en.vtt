00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:26.649 
concern was as good as the originals but

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.290 
concern was as good as the originals but
unfortunately<00:05:27.189> it<00:05:27.279> wasn't<00:05:27.459> but<00:05:27.849> those<00:05:28.179> are

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
unfortunately it wasn't but those are

unfortunately it wasn't but those are
old<00:05:28.449> classics<00:05:28.959> from<00:05:29.080> me<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.379> I<00:05:29.469> really

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
old classics from me and I really

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.009 
old classics from me and I really
enjoyed<00:05:30.099> them<00:05:30.389> so<00:05:31.389> that's<00:05:31.539> basically<00:05:31.689> the

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:32.019 
enjoyed them so that's basically the

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:33.629 
enjoyed them so that's basically the
core<00:05:32.439> foundation<00:05:33.009> of<00:05:33.099> my<00:05:33.159> gaming<00:05:33.459> history

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
core foundation of my gaming history

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.299 
core foundation of my gaming history
it's<00:05:33.999> just<00:05:34.149> a<00:05:34.240> lot<00:05:34.449> of<00:05:34.629> FPS<00:05:35.139> after<00:05:35.529> FPS<00:05:36.009> and

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:36.309 
it's just a lot of FPS after FPS and

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:37.980 
it's just a lot of FPS after FPS and
that's<00:05:36.699> probably<00:05:36.849> what<00:05:37.149> explains<00:05:37.659> why<00:05:37.839> my

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
that's probably what explains why my

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.600 
that's probably what explains why my
skills<00:05:38.289> of<00:05:38.469> transferred<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.099> current<00:05:39.430> days
