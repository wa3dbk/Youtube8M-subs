00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:22.300
 when they crushed this some tutorial of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.980
 the accordion chords of the sun in this 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.829
 video 'm not going to explain how 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.989
 call each note that make up the 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.720
 coordinate what the chords are for most 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.430
 they explain nothing to overcome that no 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.440
 you do not struggle in memorizing I know 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.020
 this and apart from the notes and all that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.910
 you are not just treading on you 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.940
 alone or I'm going to make another video 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.730
 explaining what they serve how they rise and 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.680
 all that but so that they do not stop 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.690
 that you do not get much weight I'm going 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.750
 to explain just the steps yes 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.200
 chords I hope and hope you understand that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 that I tell them and let's go to it happens with the 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.160
 chord of 2 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.760
 inside 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.800
 not sharp good 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.640
 good 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640
 no no 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.130
 Y 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.829
 Y 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.680
 re sharp or E flat 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.659
 yes 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.810
 no no 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 one 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.630
 has argued that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 Y 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.290
 Sun 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.770
 It does not matter 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.530
 sustained sun that would be time 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.520
 now yes 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.800
 or not 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 Y 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.420
 the sharp 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.010
 ah 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.010
 7 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:20.420
 gone again these are all we're going to 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.420
 give another review 2 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.780
 no no no 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:42.970
 sharp and sustained 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.350
 the afternoon 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.350
 and see 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:06.010
 you learn fabrics and nothing else 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.989
 and then I look at them with the notes of 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.330
 accordion as it's called out all for 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.799
 inside out and that's why I do not know 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.870
 mortify you do not go to flat 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.030
 footprints and the name of the agreement by 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.430
 example king all that then that you 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.590
 explain and then I also explained 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.590
 several agreements invested like this one 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.830
 as well 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.040
 I'm going to explain how they are 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.580
 those of the inverted chords that here 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.039
 for example this one is also r 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.750
 and this is also going to explain everything 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.789
 that of the inverted chords 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.590
 these are major chords then explain 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.419
 also the minor chords and all that 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.430
 if you like if you are motivated 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.229
 this video that I order and the little hand 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.210
 up to find out if they want them 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.219
 it serves the other theory videos 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.280
 I would also be uploading more 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:57.860
 more videos of instructional 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.479
 songs and all that but I hope if I 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.219
 support in this video I will upload the 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.280
 others that I already told you what they are for 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:08.560
 the first sounds will be the minor ones 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.719
 the seventh also that other chords 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.150
 the scales I'm missing is also the 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:24.650
 note the names of the night and check 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:28.569
 The win was not expected already know the 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.569
 they encourage and practice the chords too
