now<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.049> have<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:35.030> target<00:01:36.030> layer<00:01:36.810> selected

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
now when I have my target layer selected

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.460 
now when I have my target layer selected
so<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:39.150> grunt<00:01:39.479> plane<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.140> target

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so my this my grunt plane is my target

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.429 
so my this my grunt plane is my target
layer<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> select<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> now

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
layer I have to select that one and now

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.429

when<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.710> click<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> cube<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> I'm

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
when I click you see a cube and I'm

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.530 
when I click you see a cube and I'm
still<00:01:46.799> clicking<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.369> dragging<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
still clicking and dragging and when I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.370 
still clicking and dragging and when I
let<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.369> have<00:01:50.369> painted<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.060> cube<00:01:51.840> over<00:01:52.049> there

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
let go I have painted a cube over there

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.910 
let go I have painted a cube over there
again<00:01:52.890> click<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.549> drag<00:01:53.850> let<00:01:54.720> go<00:01:54.930> click<00:01:55.680> and

paint mode is set to slides when I send

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.160 
paint mode is set to slides when I send
it<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.689> strokes<00:02:01.340> then<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.719> I'm<00:02:04.219> going<00:02:05.219> to

it to strokes then you see I'm going to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.500 
it to strokes then you see I'm going to
draw<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.500> number

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
draw a number

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.990 
draw a number
of<00:02:10.510> cubes<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.320> spheres<00:02:11.800> along<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.610> stroke

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
of cubes and spheres along that stroke

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.690 
of cubes and spheres along that stroke
right<00:02:13.600> now<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.840> branch<00:02:14.200> brush<00:02:14.950> density<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
right now the branch brush density is a

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.860 
right now the branch brush density is a
bit<00:02:15.910> I'm<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:17.070> points<00:02:18.070> point<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
bit I'm going to points point one so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.990 
bit I'm going to points point one so
again<00:02:20.970> stroke<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.990> see<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:24.580> my
