00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
that I can get ready for purfling

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.310 
that I can get ready for purfling
purfling<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.520> white<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.090> black<00:01:07.600> inlay

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
purfling is the white and black inlay

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.760 
purfling is the white and black inlay
that<00:01:08.770> goes<00:01:08.950> around<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.369> edge<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:11.380> kind<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
that goes around the edge it's kind of a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.010 
that goes around the edge it's kind of a
decorative<00:01:12.070> feature<00:01:12.340> but<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:12.850> also<00:01:13.030> helps<00:01:13.840> if

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
decorative feature but it also helps if

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.900 
decorative feature but it also helps if
the<00:01:14.170> instrument<00:01:14.649> were<00:01:14.800> to<00:01:15.070> get<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.310> crack<00:01:15.670> that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
the instrument were to get a crack that

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.180 
the instrument were to get a crack that
started<00:01:16.270> on<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.420> edge<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:17.410> crack<00:01:17.619> would<00:01:17.800> stop

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
started on the edge the crack would stop

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.520 
started on the edge the crack would stop
at<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.820> end<00:01:18.940> lay<00:01:19.149> and<00:01:19.479> not<00:01:19.780> go<00:01:19.990> into<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
at the end lay and not go into the

molds<00:01:37.569> that<00:01:37.599> strata<00:01:38.050> very<00:01:38.319> used<00:01:38.619> than

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
molds that strata very used than

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.400 
molds that strata very used than
different<00:01:39.640> points<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.330> his<00:01:40.450> life<00:01:40.660> he<00:01:40.990> used

mold is one of the larger of the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.139 
mold is one of the larger of the
Stradivari<00:01:46.479> molds<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:46.959> he<00:01:47.080> used<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:48.149> it's

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
Stradivari molds that he used and it's

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
actually the exact same size and we will

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.779 
actually the exact same size and we will
actually<00:01:51.849> take<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.270> finished<00:01:53.170> measurement<00:01:53.789> of

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
actually take a finished measurement of

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.760 
actually take a finished measurement of
the<00:01:55.060> back<00:01:55.239> plate<00:01:55.599> which<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.200> standard<00:01:56.649> way

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
the back plate which is a standard way

to<00:01:56.800> measure<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.459> violin<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.239> we<00:01:58.750> try<00:01:58.959> to<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.259> it

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
to measure a violin and we try to get it

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.979 
to measure a violin and we try to get it
to<00:01:59.560> within<00:01:59.950> usually<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:01.030> tenth<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.899> a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989 
to within usually a tenth of a

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.270 
to within usually a tenth of a
millimeter<00:02:02.440> as<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.830> what

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
millimeter as to what

there<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.280> still<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.880> prejudice<00:03:14.480> in<00:03:14.720> the

better<00:03:17.840> than<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> old<00:03:18.260> instruments<00:03:18.950> part<00:03:19.640> of

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
better than the old instruments part of

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.880 
better than the old instruments part of
why<00:03:20.210> players<00:03:20.600> like<00:03:21.080> old<00:03:21.320> instruments<00:03:21.800> is

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
why players like old instruments is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.010 
why players like old instruments is
because<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.670> instruments<00:03:23.120> have<00:03:23.270> history<00:03:23.690> and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
because the instruments have history and

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.570 
because the instruments have history and
especially<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.680> great<00:03:24.890> instrument<00:03:25.460> it's

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
especially the great instrument it's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.970 
especially the great instrument it's
like<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.820> player<00:03:26.210> can<00:03:26.510> say<00:03:26.720> well<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.380> went<00:03:27.650> to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
like a player can say well it went to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.680 
like a player can say well it went to
this<00:03:28.160> virtuoso<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.240> went<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.540> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
this virtuoso and it went to that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.920 
this virtuoso and it went to that
virtuoso<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.590> now<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.400> play<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.150> so

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
virtuoso and now I get to play it and so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.840 
virtuoso and now I get to play it and so
I<00:03:32.960> think<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.380> players<00:03:33.860> probably<00:03:34.580> really

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
I think that players probably really

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.940 
I think that players probably really
like<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.420> ancestry<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.560> they<00:03:36.710> feel

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
like the ancestry and that they feel

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.670 
like the ancestry and that they feel
connected<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.210> past<00:03:38.390> world<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:39.050> music<00:03:39.530> if

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
connected to the past world of music if

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.400 
connected to the past world of music if
they<00:03:39.860> have<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.400> great<00:03:40.670> old<00:03:40.880> instrument<00:03:44.410> there

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
they have a great old instrument there

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.590 
they have a great old instrument there
is<00:03:45.680> some<00:03:45.920> research<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.490> on<00:03:46.670> about<00:03:47.150> what

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
is some research going on about what

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.210 
is some research going on about what
makes<00:03:47.900> instruments<00:03:48.470> good<00:03:48.620> instruments<00:03:49.070> and

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
makes instruments good instruments and

and<00:04:22.940> with<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.360> wood<00:04:23.510> that's<00:04:23.630> cut<00:04:23.870> away<00:04:24.110> it

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
and with the wood that's cut away it

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.090 
and with the wood that's cut away it
enables<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.540> wood<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.930> flex<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.919> is

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
enables the the wood to flex and this is

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.520 
enables the the wood to flex and this is
probably<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.760> most<00:04:28.910> important<00:04:29.450> part<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
probably the most important part of the

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.130 
probably the most important part of the
sounding<00:04:30.950> point<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.400> instrument<00:04:31.900> if<00:04:32.900> they

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
sounding point of the instrument if they

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.990 
sounding point of the instrument if they
don't<00:04:33.410> have<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> background<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.400> violin<00:04:34.850> or

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
don't have a background in violin or

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.730 
don't have a background in violin or
stringed<00:04:35.270> instruments<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:36.140> give<00:04:36.560> them

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
stringed instruments we give them

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.770 
stringed instruments we give them
lessons<00:04:36.950> because<00:04:37.430> we<00:04:37.970> feel<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.360> they<00:04:38.600> need

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
lessons because we feel that they need

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.690 
lessons because we feel that they need
to<00:04:39.020> have<00:04:39.169> at<00:04:39.320> least<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.650> rudimentary<00:04:39.980> ability

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
to have at least a rudimentary ability

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.520 
to have at least a rudimentary ability
to<00:04:40.820> play<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.240> instrument<00:04:41.810> for<00:04:42.140> them<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.410> be

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
to play the instrument for them to be

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.850 
to play the instrument for them to be
good<00:04:42.680> makers

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.670 

in<00:04:48.340> our<00:04:48.520> modern<00:04:48.880> world<00:04:49.440> people<00:04:50.440> don't<00:04:50.590> think

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
in our modern world people don't think

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.350 
in our modern world people don't think
about<00:04:50.890> where<00:04:51.250> things<00:04:51.460> come<00:04:51.730> from<00:04:51.910> people

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
about where things come from people

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.460 
about where things come from people
don't<00:04:52.510> think<00:04:52.690> about<00:04:52.870> how<00:04:53.080> they're<00:04:53.260> made

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
don't think about how they're made

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.650 
don't think about how they're made
people<00:04:53.950> don't<00:04:54.100> think<00:04:54.190> about<00:04:54.400> even<00:04:55.180> where

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
people don't think about even where

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.350 
people don't think about even where
their<00:04:55.810> food<00:04:56.050> comes<00:04:56.290> from<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.740> it's<00:04:57.670> so<00:04:57.940> nice

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
their food comes from and it's so nice

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.800 
their food comes from and it's so nice
so<00:04:59.080> you'll<00:04:59.670> be<00:05:00.670> able<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:01.090> make<00:05:01.270> something<00:05:01.660> and

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
so you'll be able to make something and

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.900 
so you'll be able to make something and
and<00:05:02.080> know<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.100> made<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.490> from<00:05:03.820> the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
and know that I made it from the

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.760 
and know that I made it from the
beginning<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.300> end<00:05:04.450> then<00:05:04.840> like<00:05:05.050> this<00:05:05.380> is<00:05:05.590> where

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
beginning to end then like this is where

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.070 
beginning to end then like this is where
it<00:05:05.890> came<00:05:06.040> from<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.700> how<00:05:07.090> I<00:05:07.510> got<00:05:07.780> there

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
it came from and this is how I got there

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.620 
it came from and this is how I got there
and<00:05:08.290> I<00:05:08.920> think<00:05:09.400> there's<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.640> lot<00:05:10.000> of<00:05:10.030> value<00:05:10.450> in

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
and I think there's a lot of value in

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.000 
and I think there's a lot of value in
that<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:11.050> gives<00:05:11.320> you<00:05:11.470> a<00:05:11.500> sense<00:05:11.860> of

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
that it gives you a sense of

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.760 
that it gives you a sense of
accomplishment<00:05:13.170> violin<00:05:14.170> making<00:05:14.500> for<00:05:14.680> all

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
accomplishment violin making for all

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.560 
accomplishment violin making for all
these<00:05:14.860> little<00:05:15.040> things<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.580> think<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.330> have<00:05:16.450> to

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
these little things I think you have to

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.360 
these little things I think you have to
be<00:05:18.450> just<00:05:19.450> intuitive<00:05:20.200> you<00:05:20.440> know<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.800> just<00:05:20.980> kind

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
be just intuitive you know and just kind

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.970 
be just intuitive you know and just kind
of<00:05:21.430> take<00:05:21.700> things<00:05:22.000> on<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.660> way<00:05:23.380> you<00:05:23.440> feel<00:05:23.680> about

I<00:05:34.670> had<00:05:35.670> no<00:05:35.940> idea<00:05:36.120> how<00:05:36.570> difficult<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:37.140> was

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
I had no idea how difficult it was

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.410 
I had no idea how difficult it was
before<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:37.890> started<00:05:38.310> school<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:39.270> know<00:05:39.360> you

before I started school you know you
start<00:05:39.780> with<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> chunk<00:05:40.410> of<00:05:40.590> wood<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.670> end

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
start with a chunk of wood and the end

start with a chunk of wood and the end
you<00:05:41.940> end<00:05:42.120> up<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:42.390> violin<00:05:42.810> I<00:05:43.080> mean<00:05:43.320> that's
