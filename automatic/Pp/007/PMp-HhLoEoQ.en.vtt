00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.480
 I would not have thought 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.580
 yes unfortunately that was formerly a black and white film included 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.550

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.339
 you should do that anyway 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.339
 Yes 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 after all, that way 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.019
 they have to 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.969
 they are not interested in this 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.089
 Longsucker II just press the red button or not so approved 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.089

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.849
 how important this 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.039

 but not normal 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.870
 that feels good 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.600
 a fine way to greet people wearing such a fine

 Dr 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.990

 Dr 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.199

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.219
 not reported 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.219
 I'm afraid of the worst 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.809
 but also the semi-final too 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.320
 why our power does not guarantee us

 Finally, be discarded 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:11.119

 the criticisms 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.180
 that's why it takes a long time
