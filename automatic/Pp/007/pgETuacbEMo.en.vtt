00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 then the rapprochement with sparta in 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 did it come from a desire to really 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.130
 make a nice project at the turn of the league 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.309
 of legends very much focused on streaming 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.770
 particular is to offer content 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.420
 with personalities who could 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.730
 really a very endearing and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 charismatic for the public all 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.180
 partner with the gaming image and our 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.660
 communication strength etc etc and the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.140
 is here to see a team evolve 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.610
 a semi pro pro team and see them 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.590
 every day a little 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 finally play and that's the atmosphere on 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 really wanted people to be able to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.540
 to have them inside a team with 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.970
 players who are quite charismatic who 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.280
 have a lived on stage and so that's it 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.190
 there have been 7 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.559
 the project at the base was proposed 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.590
 by iraqi boots in its form under the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 form in which was carried out in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.050
 made 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 and so we talked a lot during 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.820
 its clearly the negotiations have 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.930
 lasted a few months on the shape of the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.610
 thing etc etc etc 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 and finally we got here and there 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 Basically romance will go q who came 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.759
 with this idea on the long term low on 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.270
 really wanted to propose a species 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.790
 of immersion actually to viewers to people 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.440
 who followed in gaming and sparta and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.690
 we wanted to propose here 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.270
 entertainment mainly the goal 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 was really not going far 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.440
 competitively and finally that's it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.240
 had agreed with the team and players 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.570
 at the base it was really we wanted 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 cast quality because we're going 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 to say that the profiles of the spartak 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 completed well those nuts and 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 me especially for the cast so is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.760
 also some emissions stream 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.290
 more qualitative than ever before 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.750
 do it because we wanted them 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.080
 wanted to launch there in the course of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.760
 autumn 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.770
 it could not be done finally and 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.470
 So that's just about the basics of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 project then the topics that made 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.950
 flickering the deal bah I think you 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.930
 could see the commission of the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.140
 forgiveness of gaming communication has been 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.670
 relatively smooth on the subject it's up to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 to say we did not want to expand too much 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.190
 on what made that separation 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 between the sparta so I will not go back 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.340
 a lot in detail I just think 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.570
 that we made some mistakes 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.390
 but be aware that from our point 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.260
 of view nobody is all white nor everything 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.010
 black in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.989
 in the story after that I was not going 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.890
 not publicly what may have happened 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.379
 or whatever the fact is that on the side of this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.370
 parterre here publicly there have been some 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.400
 statements from them that they 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.170
 were talking about late payment 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.239
 especially 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.040
 that's it and it's true that it was one of 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.500
 stumbling blocks is actually 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.390
 we had some minor problems at that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.439
 level there we discussed a lot with 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.629
 them on moment etc 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.730
 we did we did the best at each 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.579
 time but finally from our point of view 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.010
 even if there were late payments 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.500
 at times we always made 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.099
 better to inform them to try to 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.349
 settle the thing and that's it say that 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.049
 finally and I think the delays of 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:23.519
 payment he talks about in their 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.010
 release it's a bit exaggerated of our 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.810
 point of view because at the moment when the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.609
 release was done but we should 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.040
 world had to be bigger in fact to 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.019
 sparta after doing the accounts of 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.669
 our side so here at last I think that 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.090
 finally my opinion some terms were 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:44.400
 not necessarily adapted then yes it is sure 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.310
 sure that beyond the problems 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.359
 we will say organizational that we had 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.500
 on both sides because in fact 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.120
 it's actually knowing that gaming was 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.250
 the first time we did this guy 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.900
 project on league of legends and from where 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.489
 the fact that we are con and probably 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.769
 made some mistakes because we 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.050
 learned how to manage this 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.680
 kind of project a little 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.670
 audiovisual and actually the sparta 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.180
 in fact we do very good 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.860
 performances 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.600
 it must be said little by little the team 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.920
 has improved a lot we talked about it 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.620
 with the players with the management who 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.330
 did me but it takes a level 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.310
 and we might not have expected 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.860
 inevitably for this to happen 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.209
 as high as fast so that's true 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.120
 that the players enough of the competitors 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.280
 so after a while they have they have 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.640
 had this will somehow of 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.340
 want to go to the end we will say of their 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.460
 competitive potential and well that's true 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.170
 that it's a bit antithetical 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.450
 after a while with the 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.010
 streaming because the more you stream - you 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.030
 can train in a serious way and 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.530
 vice versa so here it is true that 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.730
 after for their competitive aims at 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.450
 it was probably better than that 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.970
 stops in the bottom ben actually he 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.090
 must end probably not in the form 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.670
 such a close partnership 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.080
 that we could put it in place in celebration 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.090
 with them because there are plenty of 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.770
 constraints of the coup so it would be without 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.970
 doubt much less finally the two 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.980
 entities would probably be a lot less 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.490
 bound duration probably much less than 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.650
 constraints 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.260
 after that again the players 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.720
 we get along very well with them 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.340
 finally say no problem to have them 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.040
 for cases from time to time you have to see 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.140
 what it would be possible or otherwise but 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.230
 in the end finally we get along pretty well 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.120
 with the players here there have been 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.770
 disagreements at the management level on 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.630
 some points and again 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.400
 nobody is neither all white nor all 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.290
 black and let's say that finally I hope 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.640
 as individually 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.610
 on the other hand it's okay 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.200
 alter our personal feelings for 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.460
 people and it's just that's it 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.649
 there have been there are disagreements of 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:54.240
 management t 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:56.509
 that we could not continue sexy 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.509
 chic
