to a lot of other masks it's just like

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.180 
to a lot of other masks it's just like
it<00:02:56.860> just<00:02:56.890> gives<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.370> like<00:02:57.730> great<00:02:59.190> like

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
it just gives that like great like

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.500
