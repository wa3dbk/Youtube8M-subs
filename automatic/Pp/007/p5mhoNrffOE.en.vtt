00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.060
 nintendo this is a title that can not

 reached its maximum level with mario power 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.050
 tennis for gamecube that years later 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.390
 had an adaptation for the wii and that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.840
 today they position it in number 4 of 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.840
 our top 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.459
 number 3 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.810
 I heard 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.400
 As they did not mention popular title 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.410
 simply called as tennis that was 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.280
 developed by the same nintendo and that 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.020
 was released for nes in 1983 this game 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.610
 He is also remembered for being one of the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.400
 first tennis games in history 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.200
 and also because it has a system of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.880
 progressive difficulty that would have gone up 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 of intensity as we progressed 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.870

 heart attacks and lightning 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.920
 against the computer that surely 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.410
 did increase control of the console 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.390
 on several occasions a curious detail 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.959
 of this game is that I had mario as 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.959
 chair referee 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.110
