00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
progress if if that's the direction they

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.180 
progress if if that's the direction they
want<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.870> spend<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.680> time<00:02:28.980> on

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
want to go but we spend a lot of time on

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.980 
want to go but we spend a lot of time on
technique<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.850> teaching<00:02:30.330> things<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.780> right

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
technique and teaching things the right

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.350 
technique and teaching things the right
way<00:02:31.050> from<00:02:31.709> day<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.940> think<00:02:33.180> that's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
way from day one and I think that's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
way from day one and I think that's
something<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.260> may<00:02:34.440> set<00:02:34.709> us<00:02:34.830> apart

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
something that that may set us apart

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.960 
something that that may set us apart
from<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.760> lot<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:37.220> traditional<00:02:38.220> some<00:02:38.489> programs

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
from a lot of traditional some programs

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.790 
from a lot of traditional some programs
we<00:02:39.150> spent<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.480> lot<00:02:39.660> more<00:02:39.930> time<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.170> technique

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
we spent a lot more time on technique

00:02:40.800 --> 00:03:05.570 
we spent a lot more time on technique
than<00:02:41.280> most<00:02:41.489> programs<00:02:41.940> across<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.330> country

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.890 

we<00:03:06.580> had<00:03:06.730> three<00:03:06.970> swimmers<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.660> we<00:03:07.780> had

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
we had three swimmers in it we had

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.870 
we had three swimmers in it we had
Ashton<00:03:08.320> Ackerman<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:08.920> Liz<00:03:09.190> broadly<00:03:09.700> and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
Ashton Ackerman and Liz broadly and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.060 
Ashton Ackerman and Liz broadly and
Sarah<00:03:10.180> broadly<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.440> was<00:03:11.530> great<00:03:11.770> for<00:03:11.950> them

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
Sarah broadly and it was great for them

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.620 
Sarah broadly and it was great for them
to<00:03:12.130> be<00:03:12.400> involved<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> junior<00:03:13.450> national

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
to be involved on the junior national

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.320 
to be involved on the junior national
level<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.380> we<00:03:15.070> had<00:03:15.220> close<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.880> 1300

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
level and we had close to 1300

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.420 
level and we had close to 1300
competitors<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.470> from<00:03:17.740> all<00:03:17.890> over<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.250> country

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
competitors in from all over the country

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.420 
competitors in from all over the country
so<00:03:19.270> it's<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.140> best<00:03:20.500> 18<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.340> under

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
so it's the the best 18 and under

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.030 
so it's the the best 18 and under
swimmers<00:03:22.000> basically<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.140> USA<00:03:23.590> has<00:03:23.620> to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
swimmers basically that the USA has to

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:50.830 
swimmers basically that the USA has to

helping to run the meet we got

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.410 
helping to run the meet we got
phenomenal<00:04:02.189> reviews<00:04:02.370> from<00:04:02.909> coaches<00:04:03.299> across

phenomenal reviews from coaches across
the<00:04:03.780> country<00:04:04.140> said<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.409> was<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> best<00:04:04.769> meet

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
the country said it was the best meet

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.160 
the country said it was the best meet
they'd<00:04:05.219> ever<00:04:05.340> had<00:04:05.579> here<00:04:05.879> in<00:04:06.000> years<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.930> we<00:04:07.079> were

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
they'd ever had here in years so we were

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.440 
they'd ever had here in years so we were
really<00:04:07.319> happy<00:04:07.799> with<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.459> for<00:04:09.420> a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
really happy with that that for a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.569 
really happy with that that for a
relatively<00:04:10.170> young<00:04:10.409> organization<00:04:10.590> with<00:04:11.430> some

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
relatively young organization with some

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.170 
relatively young organization with some
experienced<00:04:12.150> coaches<00:04:12.629> we<00:04:13.700> we<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:14.969> think

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
experienced coaches we we really think

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.360 
experienced coaches we we really think
we<00:04:15.299> did<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.480> very<00:04:15.870> nice<00:04:16.139> job<00:04:16.199> in<00:04:16.739> welcoming<00:04:17.250> them

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
we did a very nice job in welcoming them

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.150 
we did a very nice job in welcoming them
to<00:04:17.430> Central<00:04:17.940> Florida<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.680> think<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:19.949> going<00:04:20.100> to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
to Central Florida I think it's going to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.129 
to Central Florida I think it's going to
help<00:04:20.250> us<00:04:20.489> bring<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.759> lot<00:04:20.940> more<00:04:20.970> big<00:04:21.570> meats<00:04:21.840> back

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
help us bring a lot more big meats back

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:32.120 
help us bring a lot more big meats back
to<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.410> area<00:04:30.020> as<00:04:31.020> far<00:04:31.349> as<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.470> logistic

diving well available for warmup it's a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.520 
diving well available for warmup it's a
deep<00:04:47.789> pool<00:04:48.060> at<00:04:48.330> seven<00:04:48.690> feet<00:04:48.900> deep<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.349> whole

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
deep pool at seven feet deep the whole

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.740 
deep pool at seven feet deep the whole
way<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:50.009> has<00:04:50.190> good<00:04:50.460> gutters<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.000> take<00:04:51.479> away<00:04:51.630> a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
way it has good gutters that take away a

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.870 
way it has good gutters that take away a
lot<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.199> waves<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.370> what<00:04:53.520> we<00:04:53.550> call<00:04:53.669> a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
lot of the waves so it's what we call a

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.719 
lot of the waves so it's what we call a
fast<00:04:54.270> pool<00:04:54.659> and<00:04:55.099> amazingly<00:04:56.099> enough<00:04:56.400> there<00:04:56.610> are

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
fast pool and amazingly enough there are

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.969 
fast pool and amazingly enough there are
differences<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.360> pools<00:04:57.720> if<00:04:58.590> they're<00:04:58.800> real

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
differences in pools if they're real

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.129 
differences in pools if they're real
shallow<00:04:59.310> there's<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.820> lot<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.120> extra<00:05:00.360> waves<00:05:00.720> and

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
shallow there's a lot of extra waves and

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.500 
shallow there's a lot of extra waves and
turbulence<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.919> swimmers<00:05:02.639> just<00:05:02.909> don't<00:05:03.150> go<00:05:03.330> as

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
turbulence and swimmers just don't go as

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.300 
turbulence and swimmers just don't go as
fast<00:05:03.810> so<00:05:04.229> it's<00:05:04.380> popular<00:05:04.949> from<00:05:05.159> that

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
fast so it's popular from that

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.580 
fast so it's popular from that
standpoint

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590
