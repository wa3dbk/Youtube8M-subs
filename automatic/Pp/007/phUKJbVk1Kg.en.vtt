00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.409 

saturation<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:01.560> color<00:00:01.949> really<00:00:02.610> means<00:00:03.030> how

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
saturation of color really means how

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.769 
saturation of color really means how
intense<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.560> color<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:06.060> sort<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
intense the color is is it sort of the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.610 
intense the color is is it sort of the
most<00:00:07.049> red<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:07.799> be<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.660> often<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.380> way<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
most red it can be and often the way to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.410 
most red it can be and often the way to
change<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.460> intensity<00:00:11.940> because<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.269> don't

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
change the intensity because you don't

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
change the intensity because you don't
always<00:00:12.599> want<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.230> red<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.130> most<00:00:14.340> red

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
always want the red to be the most red

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.420 
always want the red to be the most red
it<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:14.910> be<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:16.320> best<00:00:16.529> way<00:00:16.859> kind<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.400> change

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it can be the best way kind of to change

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.630 
it can be the best way kind of to change
that<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> actually<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.230> put<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.039> some<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that is actually to put in some of the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029 
that is actually to put in some of the
complementary<00:00:21.390> color<00:00:21.480> which<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.560> why<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.890> did

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
complementary color which is why we did

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.580 
complementary color which is why we did
the<00:00:23.160> color<00:00:23.369> wheel<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.939> did<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the color wheel I did one for you and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.750 
the color wheel I did one for you and
then<00:00:25.710> we're<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> work<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.400> little<00:00:26.550> bit

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
then we're going to work a little bit

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
then we're going to work a little bit
with<00:00:26.820> yellow<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.510> purple<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> have

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
with yellow and purple but what I have

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
with yellow and purple but what I have
here<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.640> red<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> tube<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> my

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
here is my red out of a tube and my

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.459 
here is my red out of a tube and my
green<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.399> -<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.690> most<00:00:33.870> intense

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
green out of a - that's the most intense

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.520 
green out of a - that's the most intense
color<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.250> get<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.140> I've<00:00:37.260> done

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
color I can get and then what I've done

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.280 
color I can get and then what I've done
is<00:00:37.920> try<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> come<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> neutral<00:00:39.510> point<00:00:40.020> where

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is try to come to a neutral point where

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340 
is try to come to a neutral point where
it's<00:00:40.440> neither<00:00:40.800> red<00:00:41.309> nor<00:00:41.340> green<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:42.960> even

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it's neither red nor green but an even

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
it's neither red nor green but an even
mixture<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.850> back<00:00:44.879> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
mixture of the two and then I go back in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.049 
mixture of the two and then I go back in
each<00:00:45.809> direction<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
each direction and you can see that that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.930 
each direction and you can see that that
really<00:00:48.270> does<00:00:48.570> modulate<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> color<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.820> we're

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
really does modulate the color so we're

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
really does modulate the color so we're
going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> try<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.870> yellow<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.410> purple

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
going to try this with yellow and purple

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to try this with yellow and purple
or<00:00:53.460> violet<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.690> are<00:00:54.930> opposite<00:00:55.530> each<00:00:55.620> other

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
or violet which are opposite each other

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.400 
or violet which are opposite each other
on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.219> color<00:00:56.399> wheel<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> kicker<00:00:58.020> about

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
on the color wheel but the kicker about

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.670 
on the color wheel but the kicker about
this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.280> violet<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.300> dark<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.960> can

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this is that violet is so dark you can

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.520 
this is that violet is so dark you can
see<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.160> darker<00:01:02.370> than<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> green<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
see it's much darker than the green and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.910 
see it's much darker than the green and
yellow<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.010> lighter<00:01:06.740> here's<00:01:07.740> our

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
yellow is so much lighter here's our

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
yellow is so much lighter here's our
yellow<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> lovely<00:01:09.330> lovely

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
yellow up here it's a lovely lovely

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.980 
yellow up here it's a lovely lovely
bright<00:01:10.409> yellow<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.540> light<00:01:12.810> as

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
bright yellow and it's just as light as

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
bright yellow and it's just as light as
it<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> obviously<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.189> put<00:01:17.460> these

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
it can be so obviously if you put these

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
it can be so obviously if you put these
half<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.150> half<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.049> yellow<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
half in half if you do have yellow and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.039 
half in half if you do have yellow and
have<00:01:19.740> purple<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.310> your<00:01:20.400> palette<00:01:20.840> you're<00:01:21.840> not

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
have purple on your palette you're not

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.480 
have purple on your palette you're not
going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.560> anything<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.130> looks<00:01:23.250> like

going to have anything that looks like
you<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.240> looks<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.020> yellow<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you you know that looks like yellow so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.760 
you you know that looks like yellow so
I'm<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> show<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.670> something<00:01:27.210> else<00:01:27.770> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I'm going to show you something else you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
I'm going to show you something else you
can<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.240> tube<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> bottle<00:01:31.320> on

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
can get in the tube or in the bottle on

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.190 
can get in the tube or in the bottle on
other<00:01:31.979> colors<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> most<00:01:33.780> common

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
other colors and one of the most common

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.499 
other colors and one of the most common
ones<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> yellow<00:01:34.770> ochre<00:01:35.329> sometimes<00:01:36.329> it's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
ones is yellow ochre sometimes it's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.440 
ones is yellow ochre sometimes it's
called<00:01:36.810> yellow<00:01:37.350> oxide<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> yellow

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
called yellow oxide and that is a yellow

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.569 
called yellow oxide and that is a yellow
now<00:01:42.450> put<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.200> I'll<00:01:43.290> mix<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
now put some here I'll mix it with the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.530 
now put some here I'll mix it with the
yellow<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:47.329> it's<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
yellow I have and you can see it's a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.510 
yellow I have and you can see it's a
duller<00:01:48.899> yellow<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> mustard

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
duller yellow it's more like a mustard

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.389 
duller yellow it's more like a mustard
yellow<00:01:50.729> perhaps<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.530> duller<00:01:52.890> yellow

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
yellow perhaps but it's a duller yellow

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.149 
yellow perhaps but it's a duller yellow
it's<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.420> bright<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.619> still<00:01:55.829> yellow

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
it's not as bright so it's still yellow

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we still know it's yellow but it's just

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
not as bright as that yellow is so it's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.010 
not as bright as that yellow is so it's
less<00:02:01.740> intense<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:03.240> neutral<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.990> we

less intense it's more neutral and we

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
less intense it's more neutral and we

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
can go one further because they've even

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990 
can go one further because they've even
got<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.229> sort<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.280> further<00:02:08.700> than

got this one that's sort of further than
