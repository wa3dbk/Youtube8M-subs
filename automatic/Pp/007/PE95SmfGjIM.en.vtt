vegetables so it's all around a good
thing<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:13.080> here's<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> caveat<00:01:14.930> if<00:01:15.930> that's

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
thing now here's the caveat if that's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
thing now here's the caveat if that's
what<00:01:16.680> you're<00:01:16.860> focusing<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.420> better<00:01:18.720> have

what you're focusing on you better have

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
what you're focusing on you better have
everything<00:01:19.740> else<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.130> order<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
everything else in order because it is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.660 
everything else in order because it is
by<00:01:21.540> far<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.290> most<00:01:22.619> important<00:01:23.130> thing<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
by far not the most important thing I
