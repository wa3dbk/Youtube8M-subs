00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
are we actually still talking about this

DirectX<00:00:02.520> 12<00:00:02.669> garbage<00:00:03.240> it's<00:00:03.389> been<00:00:03.570> discussed

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
DirectX 12 garbage it's been discussed

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:14.480 
DirectX 12 garbage it's been discussed
it<00:00:04.230> doesn't<00:00:04.500> really<00:00:04.589> matter<00:00:13.070> now<00:00:14.070> don't<00:00:14.280> get

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it doesn't really matter now don't get

it doesn't really matter now don't get
me<00:00:14.639> wrong<00:00:14.670> DirectX<00:00:15.420> 12<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> great<00:00:16.020> API<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
me wrong DirectX 12 is a great API and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.080 
me wrong DirectX 12 is a great API and
logically<00:00:17.010> speaking<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.550> amazing<00:00:17.940> there

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
logically speaking it's amazing there

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849 
logically speaking it's amazing there
that<00:00:18.449> we're<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.720> release<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.199> API<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that we're going to release a new API a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.220 
that we're going to release a new API a
new<00:00:20.250> API<00:00:20.580> means<00:00:20.939> more<00:00:21.180> features<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.750> games<00:00:21.960> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
new API means more features for games it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.630 
new API means more features for games it
means<00:00:22.380> better<00:00:22.529> optimization<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.400> games

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
means better optimization for games

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.240 
means better optimization for games
especially<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.630> AMD<00:00:24.990> cpus<00:00:25.439> because<00:00:25.800> DirectX

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
especially for AMD cpus because DirectX

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
especially for AMD cpus because DirectX
12<00:00:26.340> carries<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.180> crapload<00:00:27.599> of

AMD six core notwithstanding so this is

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
a good thing but it's being addressed so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
a good thing but it's being addressed so
much<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.579> the

much that you would think it's the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.830 
interview over here with Gordon Van Dyke
and<00:00:49.739> he's<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> paradox<00:00:50.910> interactive<00:00:51.449> developer

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and he's a paradox interactive developer

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
and he's a paradox interactive developer
who<00:00:51.989> quoted<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:53.219> being<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> triple<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
who quoted not being a triple a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
who quoted not being a triple a
developer<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.629> DirectX<00:00:55.320> 12<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.890> direct

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
developer that DirectX 12 is direct

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.639 
developer that DirectX 12 is direct
extolled<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.579> far<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.000> radar<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.270> now

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
extolled was far off the radar for now

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
extolled was far off the radar for now
he<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:58.829> thought<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> new<00:00:59.820> API<00:01:00.120> would

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
he also thought that the new API would

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
he also thought that the new API would
be<00:01:00.449> bigger<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.809> better<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.680> triple-a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
be bigger and better for triple-a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.290 
be bigger and better for triple-a
developers<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.059> understandable

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
developers which is understandable

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
developers which is understandable
because<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.080> research<00:01:04.439> teams<00:01:04.799> maybe

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
because they have research teams maybe

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
because they have research teams maybe
early<00:01:05.760> access<00:01:05.939> better<00:01:06.390> information<00:01:06.659> early<00:01:07.170> on

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
early access better information early on

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
early access better information early on
money<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.220> throw<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.460> things<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.060> double-a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
money to throw at things that double-a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.630 
money to throw at things that double-a
and<00:01:10.020> any<00:01:10.140> developers<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:11.220> which

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and any developers really don't which

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
and any developers really don't which
hence<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> title<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> article<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
hence the title of the article in the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440 
hence the title of the article in the
title<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.890> video<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.610> every<00:01:14.970> developers

title of the video not every developers

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.330 
title of the video not every developers
going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.780> able<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.110> take<00:01:16.590> advantage<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
going to be able to take advantage of it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
going to be able to take advantage of it
and<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.270> point<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.650> agree

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and at that point I really do agree

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
and at that point I really do agree
there<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.939> agree<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> slightly

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
there but I think I agree for a slightly

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.690 
there but I think I agree for a slightly
different<00:01:22.080> reason<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.920> other<00:01:23.130> AP<00:01:23.549> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
different reason there are other AP is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.670 
different reason there are other AP is
like<00:01:24.570> OpenGL<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:27.150> cost<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.439> much<00:01:28.470> as

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
like OpenGL that don't cost as much as

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
like OpenGL that don't cost as much as
DirectX<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.720> ways<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:31.049> better

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
DirectX that in some ways are better

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950 
DirectX that in some ways are better
than<00:01:31.500> DirectX<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.430> lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.540> comes

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
than DirectX a lot of it it just comes

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.510 
than DirectX a lot of it it just comes
down<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.439> cheaper<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.799> better<00:01:35.100> why<00:01:35.340> not

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
down to it's cheaper it's better why not

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
down to it's cheaper it's better why not
use<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.030> mean<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.540> you've<00:01:36.659> looked<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.049> all

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
use it I mean if you've looked at all

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
use it I mean if you've looked at all
like<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> Unreal<00:01:38.430> Engine<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.350> unity<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
like the Unreal Engine and unity that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.410 
like the Unreal Engine and unity that
are<00:01:40.650> pretty<00:01:40.890> actually<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.759> accessible<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
are pretty actually very accessible to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
are pretty actually very accessible to
developers<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.829> course<00:01:43.890> their<00:01:44.250> engines

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
developers but of course their engines

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.219 
developers but of course their engines
not<00:01:44.759> api's<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.780> both<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> those

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
not api's I get that but both of those

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
not api's I get that but both of those
use<00:01:46.439> OpenGL<00:01:47.040> well<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:48.090> unreal<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.689> use

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
use OpenGL well actually unreal can use

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
use OpenGL well actually unreal can use
OpenGL<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.470> direct<00:01:49.770> x<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> games

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
OpenGL or direct x but a lot of games

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
OpenGL or direct x but a lot of games
lean<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.329> heavily<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.810> OpenGL<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> API

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
lean more heavily on OpenGL for the API

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.039 
lean more heavily on OpenGL for the API
because<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.610> cheaper<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.060> some<00:01:54.479> people<00:01:54.810> say

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
because it's cheaper and some people say

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
because it's cheaper and some people say
at<00:01:55.200> least<00:01:55.229> easier<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.100> easier<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
at least easier to use and easier to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
at least easier to use and easier to
code<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.869> plenty<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.170> other

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
code for so there are plenty of other

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.539 
code for so there are plenty of other
options<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.310> why<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> think

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
options out there and that's why I think

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
options out there and that's why I think
that<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.939> not<00:02:00.060> necessarily<00:02:00.719> an<00:02:00.810> issue<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that it's not necessarily an issue of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.780 
that it's not necessarily an issue of
developers<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.430> stuck<00:02:02.610> using

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
developers are going to be stuck using

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
developers are going to be stuck using
DirectX<00:02:03.360> 11<00:02:03.719> because<00:02:04.020> Microsoft<00:02:04.560> hates<00:02:04.770> any

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
DirectX 11 because Microsoft hates any

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
DirectX 11 because Microsoft hates any
developers<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.329> logically

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
developers it's just that logically

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
developers it's just that logically
speaking<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.710> as<00:02:07.829> many<00:02:07.920> funds

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
speaking if you don't have as many funds

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
speaking if you don't have as many funds
and<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.670> people<00:02:08.819> who<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.149> maybe<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:10.020> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and you have people who are maybe just a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.690 
and you have people who are maybe just a
little<00:02:10.200> bit<00:02:10.319> more<00:02:10.470> customed<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> using<00:02:11.430> open

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
little bit more customed to using open

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
little bit more customed to using open
source<00:02:11.819> or<00:02:12.060> cheaper<00:02:12.330> stuff<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.690> OpenGL

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
source or cheaper stuff like OpenGL

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
source or cheaper stuff like OpenGL
again<00:02:13.980> engines<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.460> unity<00:02:14.820> engines<00:02:15.180> like

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
again engines like unity engines like

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.720 
again engines like unity engines like
the<00:02:15.990> unreal<00:02:16.290> engine<00:02:16.380> etc<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:17.580> they're

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the unreal engine etc then they're

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.680 
the unreal engine etc then they're
probably<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.300> lean<00:02:18.450> more<00:02:18.480> heavily

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
probably going to lean more heavily

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.690 
probably going to lean more heavily
towards<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.560> cheaper<00:02:19.980> option<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
towards the cheaper option and the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.040 
towards the cheaper option and the
option<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.240> think<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.480> better<00:02:21.690> which

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
option that they think is better which

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.590 
option that they think is better which
at<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.410> stage<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.800> game<00:02:22.860> especially

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
at this stage in the game especially

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.540 
at this stage in the game especially
with<00:02:24.600> DirectX<00:02:25.440> 12<00:02:25.560> being<00:02:25.860> new<00:02:26.070> something

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
with DirectX 12 being new something

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
with DirectX 12 being new something
that's<00:02:26.700> pretty<00:02:26.970> unexplored<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:28.710> more<00:02:29.100> known

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that's pretty unexplored the more known

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.540 
that's pretty unexplored the more known
more<00:02:30.210> stable<00:02:30.750> world<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.230> OpenGL<00:02:31.920> based<00:02:32.220> stuff

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
more stable world of OpenGL based stuff

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.610 
more stable world of OpenGL based stuff
is<00:02:32.820> probably<00:02:33.420> going<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> stay<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:34.140> popular

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
is probably going to stay more popular

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.320 
is probably going to stay more popular
with<00:02:34.740> any<00:02:34.920> developers<00:02:35.460> now<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.880> course<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.270> do

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
with any developers now of course I do

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.510 
with any developers now of course I do
web<00:02:36.630> development<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.260> graphic<00:02:37.680> design<00:02:37.710> so

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
web development and graphic design so

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.950 
web development and graphic design so
I'm<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.820> game<00:02:39.060> developer<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.570> don't<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
I'm not a game developer I don't know a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.780 
I'm not a game developer I don't know a
whole<00:02:40.170> ton<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.950> software<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.430> coding

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
whole ton on the software and coding

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.700 
whole ton on the software and coding
side<00:02:41.970> about<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.960> I'm<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.620> with

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
side about this but I'm just going with

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.830 
side about this but I'm just going with
what<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.640> conventional<00:02:45.300> logic<00:02:45.480> and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
what I think is conventional logic and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.060 
what I think is conventional logic and
if<00:02:45.900> i'm<00:02:46.050> wrong<00:02:46.260> feel<00:02:46.560> free<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.800> correct<00:02:46.920> me

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
if i'm wrong feel free to correct me

if i'm wrong feel free to correct me
down<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.370> comments<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.090> yeah<00:02:48.270> that's<00:02:48.540> all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
down in the comments but yeah that's all

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.720 
down in the comments but yeah that's all
I<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.080> say<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.290> yet<00:02:49.860> another<00:02:49.890> DirectX

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
I have to say about yet another DirectX

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
I have to say about yet another DirectX
12<00:02:50.910> article<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.960> hype<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.770> bit

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
12 article the hype is a little bit

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.830 
12 article the hype is a little bit
unnecessary<00:02:53.100> better<00:02:53.760> optimization<00:02:54.150> yet<00:02:54.660> but

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
unnecessary better optimization yet but

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.620 
unnecessary better optimization yet but
a<00:02:54.870> graphics<00:02:55.320> yeah<00:02:55.560> worthy<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:57.210> again

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
a graphics yeah worthy of the again

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.540 
a graphics yeah worthy of the again

the<00:03:07.890> fuck<00:03:08.040> down<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.090> going<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the fuck down this is going to be a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.510 
the fuck down this is going to be a
thing<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> future<00:03:10.770> but<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.100> not<00:03:11.250> here

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
thing in the future but it's not here

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.480 
thing in the future but it's not here
yet<00:03:12.110> sure<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.140> mean<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.470> Microsoft<00:03:13.980> gives<00:03:14.190> us<00:03:14.370> an

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
yet sure I mean if Microsoft gives us an

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.950 
yet sure I mean if Microsoft gives us an
update<00:03:14.790> or<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.090> new<00:03:15.240> feature<00:03:15.480> gets<00:03:15.780> demoed

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
update or if a new feature gets demoed

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.420
