00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.450
 good afternoon with you the builder about him 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.200
 Russians from Alps olshevskaya today our 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.889
 video about what is 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.500
 Elevator assembly where it is installed 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 and how it works 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.550
 so your attention is presented 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.660
 photo where is installed 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.609
 Elevator knot means Elevator 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.660
 node is installed in high-rise 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.989
 residential buildings office buildings 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 schools stores that is in all homes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.879
 where is the central system 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.860
 heating 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 mean and so what we see means self 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.530
 Elevator node here you see it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.190
 it means this flange flange assembly 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.609
 so this jumper which 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.969
 passes from the return line in under 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.600
 connects the return line and the falling 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:10.260
 means 4 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.200
 gate valves sump manometers and manometers 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
 and thermometers and petcock 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 means how they all work means in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.689
 the first for what the elevator knot is necessary 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.140
 mean at snip temperature 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:30.049
 coolant in buildings where present 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:35.130
 that is, people should not exceed 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:38.430
 temperature range 95 70 95 degrees 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.320
 this is the flow temperature in 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 residential building 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.649
 which should pass 70 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.060
 respectively, in reverse it is 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.420
 maximum temperature at 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.750
 temperature conditions on the street minus 28 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.509
 degrees the temperature of the water that we have 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.479
 comes from the heat network this here it goes 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:02.869
 like that and goes to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 the reverse side since the heating network and with 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.880
 located 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.539
 where to be several kilometers away 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.910
 must building or administrative 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.879
 accordingly, the temperature will be high 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.120
 high it means temperature history 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.000
 if degrees and 120 to 150 degrees 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.650
 so this temperature is unacceptable in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.049
 residential buildings 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.099
 therefore, an elevator assembly is installed 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.500
 elevator which serves as a pump 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.319
 mixing pump what is he 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:42.269
 represents this here 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:46.410
 the node where the nozzle is located if you 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:50.010
 look up then painted on the wall 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.519
 written more precisely the cone of the nozzle is equal 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.470
 diameter of 6 ie six millimeters 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.030
 then this is the reverse suction line 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.310
 jumper which connects the reverse 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.319
 highway and falling masters 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.130
 that is, when moving, that is, when 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:12.569
 working system means nozzle 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.280
 creates backflow water from return 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.989
 highways 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.889
 it means from here the giving moves 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.250
 highway 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:23.120
 from the heating system and here in this place that is 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.519
 mixing takes place in the chamber 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.799
 back temperature and building and falling 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.420
 from the heating system 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.849
 the temperature decreases accordingly and 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.709
 already working temperature ie 95 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:40.440
 degrees went to the house means latches 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.739
 which is located on the left side of 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.220
 of the elevator assembly they close and 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.400
 cut house latch which 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.989
 located on the right side cut off 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.470
 heating system, respectively, gauges 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.819
 show pressure which attackers 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.959
 main heating networks 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.750
 to return in heating VTI 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.380
 it means this is where we suck 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.640
 all suspended parts accumulate 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:17.239
 and the gauge is deposited accordingly 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.340
 after the sump shows when he 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.710
 polluted when it needs to be opened 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.000
 and cleaning means thermometer thermometers 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.100
 show the temperature of the coolant 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.800
 It means unfortunately these are photos but also 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.250
 she cropped started after this 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.720
 shutters should be here in this place 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.140
 2 gauges are installed respectively 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.850
 barely a thermometer cap about which 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.880
 already shows the parameters of the type of water in 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.390
 buildings coolant means 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.820
 satellite 2 is present 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.020
 cork at the crane with the help of which system 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.349
 filled up 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.910
 during the heating period is filled in 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.050
 period summer when produced 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.780
 pressure testing and so on it all was with you 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.849
