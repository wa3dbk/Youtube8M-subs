00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
7360 x 4912 resolution and i also range

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.839 
7360 x 4912 resolution and i also range
of<00:00:25.949> 100<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.630> 6400<00:00:27.630> um<00:00:28.410> that's<00:00:29.099> possible<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
of 100 to 6400 um that's possible to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.540 
of 100 to 6400 um that's possible to
around<00:00:30.150> twenty<00:00:30.510> five<00:00:30.689> hundred<00:00:30.720> six<00:00:31.410> hundred

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
around twenty five hundred six hundred

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.840 
around twenty five hundred six hundred
twenty-five<00:00:32.550> thousand<00:00:32.940> six<00:00:32.969> hundred<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:34.380> has

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
twenty-five thousand six hundred it has

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.720 
twenty-five thousand six hundred it has
51.8<00:00:35.850> autofocus<00:00:36.809> system<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> same

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
51.8 autofocus system so that's the same

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.330 
51.8 autofocus system so that's the same
as<00:00:38.760> before<00:00:39.440> SD<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.649> CF<00:00:41.219> cards<00:00:41.790> USB<00:00:43.070> 33<00:00:44.070> inches

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
as before SD and CF cards USB 33 inches

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
as before SD and CF cards USB 33 inches
of<00:00:44.550> space<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> back<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> screen<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
of space in the back so the screen is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.850 
of space in the back so the screen is
three<00:00:47.879> inches<00:00:48.059> diagonally<00:00:48.960> which<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> quite

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
three inches diagonally which is quite

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.990 
three inches diagonally which is quite
decent<00:00:50.340> um<00:00:51.350> yeah<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:53.000> apparently

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
decent um yeah so basically apparently

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
decent um yeah so basically apparently
it's<00:00:54.120> supposed<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.600> smaller<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.110> lighter

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it's supposed to be smaller and lighter

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
it's supposed to be smaller and lighter
than<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> current<00:00:56.510> d700<00:00:57.510> um<00:00:59.420> yeah<00:01:00.420> okay<00:01:00.449> i'm

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
than the current d700 um yeah okay i'm

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.770 
than the current d700 um yeah okay i'm
not<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.160> people<00:01:02.579> care<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:02.940> like

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
not think really people care about like

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.969 
not think really people care about like
if<00:01:03.960> you're<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> camera<00:01:04.769> like

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
if you're going to get a camera like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.410 
if you're going to get a camera like
this<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.339> probably<00:01:05.519> don't<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.180> care

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this you probably don't really care

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
this you probably don't really care
about<00:01:06.510> how<00:01:06.780> much<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.140> weighs<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
about how much it weighs because it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.980 
about how much it weighs because it
chances<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.000> probably<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.869> on

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
chances are it's probably going to be on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.250 
chances are it's probably going to be on
a<00:01:10.049> tripod<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.950> sort<00:01:11.689> yeah<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.869> basically

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
a tripod of some sort yeah but basically

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
a tripod of some sort yeah but basically
um<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.850> capable<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
um it's it also going to be capable of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
um it's it also going to be capable of
1080p<00:01:16.220> unfortunately<00:01:17.220> 1080p<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> only

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
1080p unfortunately 1080p is only

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
1080p unfortunately 1080p is only
capable<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.630> 30<00:01:18.840> frames<00:01:19.049> per<00:01:19.259> second

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
capable at 30 frames per second

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.719 
capable at 30 frames per second
fortunately<00:01:20.729> 720p<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> capable<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.080> 63<00:01:22.710> m<00:01:22.799> 60

comparable to like the mark series of
canon<00:01:40.200> um<00:01:40.770> yeah<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.700> guess<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> mean<00:01:42.420> 36

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
canon um yeah I guess so I mean 36

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
canon um yeah I guess so I mean 36
megapixel<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> massive<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.180> sure

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
megapixel is massive I'm not really sure

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
megapixel is massive I'm not really sure
anyone<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> their<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.229> minds<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.710> even

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
anyone in their right minds would even

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.130 
anyone in their right minds would even
need<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> 36<00:01:47.909> megapixel<00:01:48.420> camera<00:01:48.720> eat<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.020> you're

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
guess its DS the specs are actually

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
guess its DS the specs are actually
