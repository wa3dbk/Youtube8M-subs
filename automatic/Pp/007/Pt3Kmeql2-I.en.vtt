00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.040
 ah 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.700
 tec in this broadcast you will be able to observe 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.769
 how to install what would be the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.759
 resurrection remix with his version of 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.020
 android 5.1 passed in tension let's make 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.040
 12.1 so well let's start with 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.509
 this video well the first thing that 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.669
 we would have as always I will give 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.619
 the safety recommendations for 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.050
 our device that comes to have a 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.240
 the android cope our device the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.849
 copy of the folder fs that is the folder 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.800
 of the email and the signal from the operator and 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.170
 finally, then, have the recovery touch 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.480
 obviously or any other recovery 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.830
 advanced and obviously once you already 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.019
 have all these requirements met 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.530
 I always recommend it for safety 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.729
 the basics would be to download what is 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.409
 the course that I will leave you in the 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.940
 description of this video to the same as 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.040
 the glasses the glasses are the applications 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.839
 of google and I leave you all these these 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.820
 files sheets you stored in your 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.890
 sd and power we can put our 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.809
 device in what would be the engine that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.339
 well no small parenthesis of how it 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.920
 enter the mother cover and it would be com 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.200
 pressing the volume up button 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.369
 power and the home button five seconds and 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.350
 after that we release it if not 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.670
 will focus on what the recovery is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.530
 once we are here we are going to do the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.470
 corresponding whites if you have this 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.390
 recovery 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.010
 you have to know that it includes all of us 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.320
 the webs within this install 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.780
 and your room or you can do all three 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.670
 websites is that it's practically the same 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.440
 but I will do it this cool because I 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.970
 it makes a little cleaner once 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.730
 finished proceed to see what 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.390
 it's a touch and return to once in the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.400
 start we will proceed to the installation 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.840
 has made the tip prop instaurase de 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.330
 karwan remember that we are going to install what 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.460
 which is the rumba and the cats and now 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.430
 I have for failing me here 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.800
 resurrection remix in version 5.4 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.330
 let's define perfect once 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.619
 has already installed what is the rumba 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.070
 let's proceed to install what they are 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.500
 the glasses 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.940
 them some gaps download and I'll 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.710
 install a basic that personally 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.110
 There are 3 megs simply includes what 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.880
 is the google play and also the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.830
 google services there is another one that weighs 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.240
 about 400 megabytes but it's complete 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.880
 well in all google applications 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.770
 with sainz material 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.750
 well then I install this and proceed 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.640
 just give it this does not make me very 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.200
 necessary to the others this process 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.870
 simple and we wait for normally 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.100
 finish the installation well then one 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.750
 Once you have finished here we will give you 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.820
 a tap we go back to what is the beginning 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 and we give the rebot system so that it does not 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.850
 understand what would be the android 5.1 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.800
 lollipop I'll wait for it to start 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.040
 the logo that I do not particularly like 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.870
 Much of the resurrection remix but well 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.520
 is coming back and when I do the first 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.680
 on we set up the device and 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.629
 we will do a little review 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.579
 the first good start if you have installed 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.560
 other directions because you have to configure the 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.200
 to your liking already so much July accelerates 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.200
 these steps and well let's accelerate those 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.760
 the first blessed as they see the launcher 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.560
 it is very customizable very configurable 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.330
 so we have to leave it well 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.950
 pressed and slide it here we can 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.870
 add what widgets are also 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.610
 that brings the watch that the truth is seen 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.099
 pretty pretty pretty now let's go 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.319
 make a small step there, this would be 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.780
 what is the width of the widgets the 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.220
 widget that I liked the most would be the one 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.049
 watch that we can add what is the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.090
 Weather calendar of the watch you see 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.280
 quite pretty well and this obviously 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.900
 it's configurable and you can put it to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.250
 your taste and so much eye I just you 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.250
 I give a little test 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.099
 this launcher and well well I also think 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.709
 that you already realized what it would be 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.260
 the bar that leaves you here with the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.510
 buttons that are on the screen you what 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.849
 you can remove or configure then 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.980
 what is the interface configuration and 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.010
 here disable what would be the bar 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.079
 navigation to remove those these bars 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.340
 of navigation that was here abajito 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.810
 as we can see it has a lot 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.359
 customization in what is the bar 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.849
 been and also around here to transit 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.370
 how will you see what is the bar 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.959
 navigation that I just removed and good 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 so if we go down we can also see how 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.190
 for example the various settings that this 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.170
 it would be the web locker animation and more 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.609
 things like for example the circular bar 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.250
 of applications that it had already 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.480
 brought to the sierra and droid that is 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.449
 very useful when using the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.489
 device to add effects or 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.400
 applications and give it an effect that looks 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.560
 very promising and very useful this way 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.500
 say me there it is and we can select 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.210
 what is an application 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.680
 another thing that we can also have 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.000
 would be what is the lock screen 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.180
 we can configure what are the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.280
 shortcuts shortcuts and good 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.630
 Well, more things like you can see 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.730
 you will have to go testing each 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.610
 thing so that your device s3 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.410
 be more to your liking both in what is 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.910
 the notification bar I have not 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.700
 shown but brings what is the 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.200
 5.1 lollipop animation and also we 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.960
 includes shortcuts as per 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.170
 example the wifi and the bluetooth that I finish 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.170
 to put 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.710
 and obviously also includes us what 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.499
 the customization that we can remove or 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.599
 put shortcuts here in the 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:07.129
 buttons we can find what already 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.990
 we have found other directions so 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.470
 there's not much to show and well 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.360
 obviously what would be 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.370
 the basics like screen sounds 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.230
 storage and everything that brings 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.120
 roms if we go to the information the 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.820
 device we can see that we have the 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.620
 Android version 5.1 and it is the 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.560
 remix resolution if we want to know a 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.850
 little bit more about we hear it here and 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.610
 here would give us what is the website 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.500
 share the rom or let's see what 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.140
 changes has this rom had along and 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.430
 width of your development as you can see 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.430
 here they have what is the changelog 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.070
 what has the cello to see 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.510
 what changes has affected and what has 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.130
 obviously does not have a very performance 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.760
 effective because obviously it's just in 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.670
 already stable phase but good 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.320
 that are working more thoroughly not as 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.550
 in the previous room called UFO 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.190
 room that is would leave it here too 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.680
 it was a very, very good test here you have 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.050
 install it because I already tried this rom and the 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.000
 battery like this consumes a little bit of hair 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.270
 more than the ones in a hd but it's logical 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.310
 because it's already 5.1 resurrection remix 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.560
 it has always been cataloged as making one 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.080
 of the first to bring the roms for 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.100
 our device and well then without more 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.140
 for the moment I'm going to say goodbye 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.940

 next
