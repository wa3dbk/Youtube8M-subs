00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.000
 it is to him everyone is sir 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.650
 plutonium and we find ourselves today 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.660
 for a new video a new 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.610
 gameplay is inevitably a new 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.440
 commander harrie gold first of all I 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.750
 would like to thank code qg kotcheff if 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.830
 one of the two chains where both 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.590
 drivers so that's just me 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.610
 would be enormously pleased to turn that 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.340
 of clichÃ©s show already had more than one 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.780
 time and it really made me happy 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.860
 so already I'll start with 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.850
 introduce to the gameplay so you have 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.040
 certainly saw the subject under the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.020
 video or gameplay a little bit of what 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.900
 how finally will it be 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.770
 composed then simply in-game that 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.799
 I joined so on the info 300 mm on 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.619
 out post so a map big enough that 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.970
 I do not appreciate strong not necessarily but 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.490
 this is niang was pretty good 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 rolled out so play at Lille 4-1 aiming 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.439
 silent laser gold with radar 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.690
 portable c4 and specialist assets 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.820
 that I unlock must do wall then 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.560
 as is certainly seen under 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
 the video it's going to be a moab attempt 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.000
 a perfect attempt ie not 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
 not die everything on the game so I'm going 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.820
 not spoiler you will see well if I 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.840
 will succeed or not and for the subject 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.660
 of tahri commands so that's going to be 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.670
 I'm just talking to you a little bit 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.920
 the evolution of video games 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 mentalities versus video games 2 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 how to apprehend video games 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.640
 a little 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.670
 now and before end begins to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.440
 change in fact so I'm going to these details 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.300
 and that's the best possible and to see a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.340
 little understand what I think there 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.530
 on it so first of all so you have to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.370
 know that video games have a strong 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.740
 evolved over the years is the son 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.680
 about ten years ago now 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.840
 the players enormously evolved while even 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.030
 before ten years ago I do for example 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.880
 summer really old consoles the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.860
 sega the gamecube that frame a little 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.980
 more recent but here are all these 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.220
 game consoles categorize a little the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.230
 old consoles from alela 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.280
 plus call it 1 pretty much i mean 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.489
 that I will tell in like the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.989
 old consoles and has a lot 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.150
 changed only on the country fossil there 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.950
 had not live 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.830
 acer that you really play at all the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.690
 solo games I do not know sonic 1 especially 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.910
 for the sega sony all solo games 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.770
 like that really is in my opinion 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.530
 find that we took more pleasure in 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.630
 made to play these games there it was 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.440
 many more games from the adventures of 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.420
 gameplay games of esp and finally dd 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.000
 I leave pleaded platform games 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.920
 and all that and I find that really 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.110
 it was really games or toys 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 after the days after the course days 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.730
 for a little de-stressing and it was 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.620
 really games we took 1 veal 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.989
 during pleasure and you do not rage or 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.920
 never end we try to finish his level 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.410
 for example on sonic but 160 pressure 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.320
 is really it was very good 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.880
 moments on it and really it's to be 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.280
 a bit what we should finally regret 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.049
 not maybe not regret but think 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.970
 a bit of that now squeezes that the 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.170
 video games for us what is it for 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.090
 three quarters of people it's call of 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.830
 duty and it should not be all that 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.170
 even if me really I almost you 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.610
 that that's true and it's a bit 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.090
 pity I will be really discovering 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.690
 little storage juice than that and you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
 nothing to return to the classic from before 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.230
 have not returned to games 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.750
 old but really good 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.730
 it's different games you 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.980
 buy and you were really happy 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.659
 to play there I speak I think also to tomb 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.950
 raid that I played a lot on play 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.250
 1 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 lara croft tomb raider it was 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.940
 really a very good adventure game but 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.760
 really a huge game I did 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.549
 twice I think several tomb raider 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.739
 and I really play a lot with these 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.389
 games there and I really loved it and that's 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.850
 it's not better to say that it's me 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.110
 missing because now I will get myself 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.050
 maybe a little shit on these games 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.130
 it's true but really when I 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.020
 were playing these games there it's really a 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.880
 pure pleasure 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.110
 and here I come can you do 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.760
 understand that I do not know if you 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.080
 understand a bit what I mean 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.220
 in any case if in the comments 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.720
 you are a bit like me if you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.820
 start doing if you have a little 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.720
 to play these games there is different I 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.979
 do not hesitate to say in the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.710
 comments to what games you played 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.900
 on which account on which console 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.150
 in what context etc at what age 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.410
 in any case me it's a little it was 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.910
 especially when I was in primary of 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.900
 shot at that moment so here I 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.699
 unblocks the first map 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.500
 finally the first me the only me it's 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.910
 a successful attempt we will see 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.770
 now if I will succeed in not 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.560
 to die in the cyber shoppers range the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.300
 perfect attempt so that's it I think 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.440
 that for the subject does a little bit about 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.150
 the turn so that's a really topic 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.220
 very short while the gameplay is 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.220
 quite short so we still have them 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.510
 rather it is fucked so I took 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.830
 I will quickly introduce if I pass 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.930
 on community channels so bah 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.650
 my gameplay make my gamertag it's 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.650
 Mr. plutonium 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.590
 maggie may my gamertag that necessarily says 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.840
 I'm on xbox xbox 360 xbox one 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.610
 so i'm also on pc recently 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.520
 so a pretty good pc that can do 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.950
 turn the latest games bf3 bf four 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.240
 weapons then focused too much on the chain 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.280
 you will have a little diversity 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.590
 even if it is necessary to confess my chain is 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.950
 basically focused on on 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.530
 code 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:48.430
 so I have a lot of code a four code 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:51.889
 coins in two black ops 93 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.240
 1/3 blackhawks 2 ghost and so 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.610
 that's still a lot of diversity 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.969
 so on xbox world 360 basically 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.300
 on pc a few games i will try to 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.590
 do some videos with the team 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.449
 Well, it's complicated to find each other 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.460
 on the same platform given that we 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.099
 has a little switch and finally a little split 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.840
 but here it is, I'm trying to get you 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.939
 present quite cool gameplay so 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.490
 a little performance of the orders 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.900
 tahri - themed student how tahri of 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.180
 challenges that you can offer me the 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.919
 comments etc 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.479
 so here I hope in any case to be 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.590
 closing on different channels 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.969
 community so that would make me 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.129
 really enormously pleasure I 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.949
 again thank you Boy was 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:33.080
 thanks otherwise but my subscribers who who 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.860
 are quite present and who participates 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.110
 really pretty well in the 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.279
 comments so that's it so I'm finishing 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:44.240
 on so a perfect and we will be your 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:47.539
 beat them 7500 to 3400 so oath 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.860
 a fairly easy range this is a small 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.969
 quite short gameplay so I hope that 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.719
 you will have enjoyed gameplay so 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.000
 ended on the 28 0 I think just 31.0 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.560
 so here it is and I'm just telling you 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.979
