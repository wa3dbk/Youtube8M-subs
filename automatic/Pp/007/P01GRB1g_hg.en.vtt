00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.830
 Good day, very often yes here 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.169
 turnstiles ask each other there who 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.700
 how many stretch how many times on 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.950
 in fact, this is a force question 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.720
 endurance and speed you wear 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.580
 which is very useful in martial arts 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.890
 Now I will show such a very interesting 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.720
 test which is used in some 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.000
 divisions there really give two 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.789
 stick in hand and need to go through the tracks 20 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.369
 dummies and put on 2-3 blows 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.239
 see from here there will be a corridor 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.149
 such of the guys who are like 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.070
 I will have to beat just I will not drink 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:44.010
 just how to endure it chaotic 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.010
 name shots let's say I run away 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.260
 who grids need to go through in principle 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.840
 big enough row that's interesting then 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.340
 that when they put say more power 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.820
 dummies and need to put 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.989
 two or three stick two shelves two or three 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.619
 hitting each 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.479
 until the end of this test of even 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.190
 special units reached very little 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.820
 people that is endurance and not repent 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.830
 there were enough hands down there fell well 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.750
 This is understandable if people do not 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.860
 resist and now see if 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 yes people resist 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.450
 let me run 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.570
 I already see his attack 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.979
 harder yes what am I telling you all this 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.270
 everyone knows what is musashi miyamoto 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.270
 heard it the most famous so was 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 swordsman on swords and here's an interesting 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.350
 there was a case when he talked with 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.810
 the teacher asks his teacher 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.270
 this massage but if you were attacked 60 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.450
 samurai to do it I would give everything 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.099
 chopped down there and if 70 too everyone would 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.280
 chopped a80 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.979
 he thought so and teacher street 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.289
 so weak scared some 80 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.149
 samurai why am I telling you all this 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.940
 because then there was a fight in which he 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.739
 won over 80 samurai and here you are 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.620
 can you imagine yes that is it 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.290
 just guys are kids and even if 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.239
 just run like a fighter like if 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.440
 all on me at the same time fund probably 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.380
 it won't be easy 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.209
 but they were not children, they were samurai 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.120
 there is also prepared and very 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.580
 ok and here is your technical 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.099
 mastery of course play a role for more 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.680
 already playing stamina phenomenal 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.540
 ability even already able here 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.700
 so that is to react to act 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 this is paradoxically very 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.010
 well worked out on the horizontal bars 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.319
 dacadoo 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.230
 when so much catch up on 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.209
 speed yes that is what we are talking about 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.140
 shock endurance why horizontal bars 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.620
 are used 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.859
 may like to show how much 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.569
 cool in the same boxing talent yes then 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.060
 there are used like very large 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.340
 loads of endurance and horizontal bars and running 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.849
 as in my understanding this is one of the best 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.849
 means of operating time from and power 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:15.519
 endurance date music here begins 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:17.560
 sword but it's in the background no they 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.659
 periodically children in general beat as you 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.030
 always need to clarify and show 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.379
 personal authority as well, that the principle 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.840
 I say therefore horizontal bars if you 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.579
 pull up quickly and seemingly like not 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.409
 very technical really not so 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.640
 bad it just turns out you have a nose 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.640
 well if he
