00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello dear 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.170
 Internet users want to share with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.170
 your experience of construction and time about it 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.949
 description single made of 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.519
 fiberglass body that is 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 skis are all glued together in fiberglass 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.619
 thanks to what time they turned out very 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 lightweight strong this allowed not 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.530
 use extra frame a 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.800
 make the body carrying 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.989
 engines we used bodice 15 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.430
 strong 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:49.789
 three times lowering screw meter 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:54.170
 eighty diameter and screw pitch 100 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:58.070
 We have a spring rear suspension 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 shock absorber in spring 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:08.159
 pressed salenbloki so you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.460
 it does not turn around but when 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 need a little bit she also plays 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.290
 can play up and down with the word 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.350
 say the suspension turned out in principle 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.710
 very easy reliable i said so 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.290
 successful advise 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.770
 experiment try front 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.189
 we have a simple spring suspension 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.990
 Well, I thought to make her so 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.650
 in order not to burden the snowmobile cabin here 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.650
 leans back 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:54.860
 reclining there is one landing 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:57.409
 place body reinforced spars they 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.470
 also made of fiberglass 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.869
 supplemented and run further salon 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.020
 rule held heating what 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.090
 allows you to not freeze the glass 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.280
 well, the principle of wear sleigh slightly warmer 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.050
 Well, in principle, now we probably 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.050
 let's go see how we have them 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 moving on the go in his sleigh have 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.650
 the battery that is, it was possible to start 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.650
 which is very convenient in principle 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.849
 special attention would still freeze on 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.739
 that as time they are very economical 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.150
 turned out very reliable and that is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.180
 fuel consumption is 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 finishes of two liters per hour is by 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.780
 average snow if the snow is dense and that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.139
 less if very loose no more than three 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.139
 liters 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.470
 as you have probably seen and since they are going 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.960
 in any snow we have loose snow 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.660
 have they move confidently if snow 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.650
 very dense then the speed they can 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.430
 develop up to 80 kilometers per hour that i 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.990
 I think it is enough for rest 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.020
 hunt love can use them on 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.410
 fishing, that is, well, perhaps this 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.850
 finish if there is interest 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.270
 call ask tell all 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.270
 in detail
