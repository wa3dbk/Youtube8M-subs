complicated<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.829> pretty<00:00:37.950> easy<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.250> we

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
complicated but it's pretty easy here we

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
complicated but it's pretty easy here we
go<00:00:38.520> well<00:00:38.940> break<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.420> into<00:00:39.690> three

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
go well break it down into three

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.490 
go well break it down into three
distinct<00:00:41.070> units<00:00:41.579> first<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> basic<00:00:43.020> four

we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> stay<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.409> spot<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
we're going to stay in one spot so that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
we're going to stay in one spot so that
the<00:01:12.030> combination<00:01:12.570> handle<00:01:13.080> inside<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.439> part

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the combination handle inside this part

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.050 
the combination handle inside this part
one<00:01:14.180> one<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.540> three<00:01:15.930> four<00:01:16.380> bottom<00:01:16.830> leave<00:01:17.060> part

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
one one two three four bottom leave part

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.600 
one one two three four bottom leave part
to<00:01:18.240> cross<00:01:18.750> hook

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
to cross hook

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
to cross hook
bodily<00:01:20.659> hook<00:01:21.659> cross<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.900> okay<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
bodily hook cross and that's okay so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:50.450 
bodily hook cross and that's okay so
just<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.680> try<00:01:25.890> again<00:01:26.100> right

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 

oh<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:52.049> happens<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.799> he<00:01:52.920> goes<00:01:53.070> 1<00:01:53.310> 2

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
oh now what happens is when he goes 1 2

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.260 
oh now what happens is when he goes 1 2
3<00:01:53.580> 4<00:01:53.850> 1<00:01:54.090> 2<00:01:54.420> 3<00:01:54.869> 4<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.000> where<00:01:57.180> he's
