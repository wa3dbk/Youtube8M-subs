sought over points on this entire map
it's<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.090> very<00:01:13.299> valuable<00:01:13.570> point<00:01:14.020> as<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.710> can

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
it's a very valuable point as you can

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.980 
it's a very valuable point as you can
spawn<00:01:15.159> on<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.700> launch<00:01:15.970> attacks<00:01:16.150> at<00:01:16.810> all

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
spawn on it and launch attacks at all

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.539 
spawn on it and launch attacks at all
the<00:01:17.140> other<00:01:17.259> points<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:17.830> having<00:01:18.189> another

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
the other points so having another

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.490 
the other points so having another
access<00:01:19.090> route<00:01:19.299> to<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.630> it's<00:01:19.960> going<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.259> make<00:01:20.380> it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
access route to it it's going to make it

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.620 
access route to it it's going to make it
very<00:01:20.530> difficult<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.369> defend<00:01:21.729> however<00:01:22.360> the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
very difficult to defend however the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.050 
very difficult to defend however the
site<00:01:22.840> has<00:01:23.080> got<00:01:23.290> a<00:01:23.320> lot<00:01:23.710> more<00:01:23.740> areas<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.460> Hyden

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
site has got a lot more areas to Hyden

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.359 
site has got a lot more areas to Hyden
in<00:01:25.210> fact<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.630> entire<00:01:25.780> hill<00:01:26.350> itself<00:01:26.799> has

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
in fact the entire hill itself has

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.920 
in fact the entire hill itself has
pretty<00:01:27.640> much<00:01:27.729> been<00:01:28.000> hollowed<00:01:28.420> out<00:01:28.540> with<00:01:28.780> an

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
pretty much been hollowed out with an

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.110 
pretty much been hollowed out with an
underground<00:01:29.470> bunker<00:01:29.829> so<00:01:30.340> at<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> base<00:01:30.730> of<00:01:30.790> the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
underground bunker so at the base of the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.480 
underground bunker so at the base of the
tower<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:31.990> actually<00:01:32.350> go<00:01:32.830> down<00:01:33.070> through

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
tower you can actually go down through

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.220 
tower you can actually go down through
multiple<00:01:34.030> entry<00:01:34.390> points<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.780> believe<00:01:34.810> there's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
multiple entry points I believe there's

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.560 
multiple entry points I believe there's
at<00:01:35.380> least<00:01:35.409> three<00:01:36.130> there<00:01:36.370> might<00:01:36.610> be<00:01:36.640> more<00:01:37.090> you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
at least three there might be more you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.570 
at least three there might be more you
can<00:01:37.690> even<00:01:37.840> take<00:01:38.080> an<00:01:38.260> elevator<00:01:38.680> up<00:01:38.890> on<00:01:39.159> top<00:01:39.430> of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
can even take an elevator up on top of

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.100 
can even take an elevator up on top of
the<00:01:39.670> tower<00:01:39.850> if<00:01:40.030> you'd<00:01:40.180> like<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.840> get<00:01:40.960> some

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the tower if you'd like to get some

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.500 
the tower if you'd like to get some
crazy<00:01:41.350> long-range<00:01:41.979> sniper<00:01:42.250> positions<00:01:42.909> but<00:01:43.390> as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
crazy long-range sniper positions but as

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.850 
crazy long-range sniper positions but as
you<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.720> see<00:01:43.780> here<00:01:44.170> we're<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.440> sort<00:01:44.650> of<00:01:44.710> this

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
you can see here we're in sort of this

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.610 
you can see here we're in sort of this
weird<00:01:45.070> server<00:01:45.490> room<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.150> guess<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.570> data<00:01:47.140> center

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
weird server room I guess a data center

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.410 
weird server room I guess a data center
that<00:01:47.650> would<00:01:48.130> probably<00:01:48.430> process<00:01:49.180> all<00:01:49.300> the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
that would probably process all the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.270 
that would probably process all the
radio<00:01:49.690> stuff<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.440> here<00:01:50.680> next<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.100> giant

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
radio stuff and here next to the giant

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280 
radio stuff and here next to the giant
flammable<00:01:51.970> gas<00:01:52.210> tank<00:01:52.510> we've<00:01:52.659> got<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:52.900> laptop

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
flammable gas tank we've got a laptop

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.980 
flammable gas tank we've got a laptop
hooked<00:01:54.040> up<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.400> some<00:01:54.550> explosives<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.420> once

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
hooked up to some explosives and once

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.140 
hooked up to some explosives and once
this<00:01:56.229> timer<00:01:56.620> goes<00:01:57.159> down<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:57.970> trigger

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
this timer goes down and you can trigger

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.760 
this timer goes down and you can trigger
this<00:01:58.360> timer<00:01:58.630> much<00:01:58.930> like<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.290> bomb<00:01:59.500> ons

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
this timer much like the bomb ons

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.910 
this timer much like the bomb ons
evad3rs<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.750> underground<00:02:08.229> area<00:02:08.500> and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
evad3rs of the underground area and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.949 
evad3rs of the underground area and
coming<00:02:09.250> up<00:02:09.399> here<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:09.940> there's<00:02:10.119> multiple<00:02:10.330> entry

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
coming up here so there's multiple entry

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.780 
coming up here so there's multiple entry
points<00:02:10.989> they're<00:02:11.470> making<00:02:12.129> D<00:02:12.280> point<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.640> much

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
points they're making D point a much

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.970 
points they're making D point a much
more<00:02:12.970> interesting<00:02:13.450> area<00:02:14.049> and<00:02:14.260> giving

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
more interesting area and giving

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.160 
more interesting area and giving
infantry<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.549> lot<00:02:15.790> more<00:02:15.970> cover<00:02:16.209> because<00:02:16.480> before

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
infantry a lot more cover because before

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I like the overgrown look that they sort

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.280 
I like the overgrown look that they sort
of<00:02:30.519> brought<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.909> it<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.209> some<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.110> like

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
destroyed as I cap the point here the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
same area this is of course conquest

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.800 
same area this is of course conquest
large<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.760> we<00:02:42.790> still<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.330> same<00:02:43.510> five

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.020 
large so we still have the same five
capture<00:02:44.290> points<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.830> vehicles<00:02:45.310> seem<00:02:45.880> to

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
capture points and the vehicles seem to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.460 
capture points and the vehicles seem to
be<00:02:46.180> pretty<00:02:46.360> much<00:02:46.480> identical<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
be pretty much identical to the

of it the graphics look so great
especially<00:03:53.860> on<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.640> Xbox<00:03:55.570> one<00:03:55.690> here

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
especially on the Xbox one here

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.350 
especially on the Xbox one here
everything's<00:03:56.560> been<00:03:56.740> optimized<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.580> well<00:03:57.850> so

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
everything's been optimized so well so

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.090 
everything's been optimized so well so
you<00:03:58.420> still<00:03:58.660> get<00:03:58.780> those<00:03:58.990> nice<00:03:59.200> 60<00:03:59.620> frames<00:03:59.890> per

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
you still get those nice 60 frames per

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.160 
you still get those nice 60 frames per
second<00:04:00.550> and<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:01.120> can't<00:04:01.330> wait<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.570> see<00:04:01.720> actually

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
second and I can't wait to see actually

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.230 
second and I can't wait to see actually
what<00:04:02.350> this<00:04:02.470> looks<00:04:02.710> like<00:04:02.800> on<00:04:03.010> console<00:04:03.520> with<00:04:03.700> 64

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
what this looks like on console with 64

what this looks like on console with 64
players<00:04:04.540> other<00:04:04.990> than<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.350> tower<00:04:05.680> there's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
players other than the tower there's

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.100 
players other than the tower there's
lots<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.340> ruin<00:04:06.790> tanks<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.480> vehicles<00:04:07.510> and

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
lots of ruin tanks and vehicles and

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.390 
lots of ruin tanks and vehicles and
trucks<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.650> sort<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:08.980> thing

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
trucks and that sort of thing

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.490 
trucks and that sort of thing
littered<00:04:10.030> throughout<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.720> battlefield<00:04:11.290> and

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
littered throughout the battlefield and

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.900 
littered throughout the battlefield and
it<00:04:11.620> really<00:04:11.800> does<00:04:12.010> make<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.340> feel<00:04:12.490> like<00:04:12.730> there

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
it really does make you feel like there

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.820 
it really does make you feel like there
was<00:04:13.120> once<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.660> huge<00:04:13.930> battle<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.410> went<00:04:14.650> on<00:04:14.800> here

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
was once a huge battle that went on here

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.610 
was once a huge battle that went on here
the<00:04:15.520> wall<00:04:15.760> itself<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.540> big<00:04:16.870> addition<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
the wall itself is a big addition to the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.470 
the wall itself is a big addition to the
map<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.190> I'm<00:04:18.280> very<00:04:18.489> curious<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:18.970> see<00:04:19.060> how<00:04:19.330> it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
map and I'm very curious to see how it

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.750 
map and I'm very curious to see how it
plays<00:04:19.630> out<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.260> think<00:04:20.890> just<00:04:21.220> based<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.549> how<00:04:21.730> I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
plays out I think just based on how I

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.220 
plays out I think just based on how I
saw<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.270> far<00:04:22.480> seems<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.050> might

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
saw it so far seems like it might

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.680 
saw it so far seems like it might
actually<00:04:23.290> favor<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.130> Russian<00:04:24.550> side<00:04:24.790> just<00:04:25.540> a

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
actually favor the Russian side just a

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.970 
actually favor the Russian side just a
little<00:04:25.990> bit<00:04:26.110> because<00:04:26.290> it's<00:04:26.590> going<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.830> give

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
little bit because it's going to give

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.030 
little bit because it's going to give
the<00:04:27.160> US<00:04:27.490> side<00:04:27.700> fewer<00:04:28.480> ways<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.020> actually<00:04:29.440> get

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
the US side fewer ways to actually get

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.460 
the US side fewer ways to actually get
through<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.910> wall<00:04:31.150> itself<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.110> Russians

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
through the wall itself so the Russians

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.710 
through the wall itself so the Russians
might<00:04:32.920> have<00:04:33.220> some<00:04:33.430> opportunities<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.180> try<00:04:34.600> and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
might have some opportunities to try and

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.960 
might have some opportunities to try and
slow<00:04:35.020> down<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.770> ground<00:04:36.100> movement<00:04:36.670> from<00:04:36.790> the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
slow down the ground movement from the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.690 
slow down the ground movement from the
US<00:04:37.360> now<00:04:37.930> from<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.320> aerial<00:04:38.800> view<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.310> can<00:04:39.490> see

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
US now from the aerial view you can see

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.000 
US now from the aerial view you can see
that<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.060> wall<00:04:40.540> itself<00:04:40.900> actually<00:04:41.200> spans<00:04:41.740> the

there<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.520> an<00:04:57.669> area<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.210> wall<00:04:58.389> that<00:04:58.419> has

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
there is an area of the wall that has

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.469 
there is an area of the wall that has
collapsed<00:04:59.319> this<00:04:59.919> offers<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.370> third<00:05:00.819> access

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
collapsed this offers a third access

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.719

point<00:05:01.750> through<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.289> wall<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:02.729> technically

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
point through the wall so technically

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.399 
point through the wall so technically
there's<00:05:03.939> only<00:05:04.120> three<00:05:04.449> ways<00:05:04.689> to<00:05:04.719> get<00:05:05.050> through

there's only three ways to get through

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.980 
there's only three ways to get through
the<00:05:05.530> wall<00:05:05.680> if<00:05:05.949> you're<00:05:06.129> on<00:05:06.340> ground<00:05:06.879> which<00:05:07.599> for<00:05:07.960> a

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
the wall if you're on ground which for a

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.659 
the wall if you're on ground which for a
map<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.379> this<00:05:08.590> size<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:09.009> actually<00:05:09.370> pretty

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
map of this size is actually pretty

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.219 
map of this size is actually pretty
small<00:05:09.969> so<00:05:10.240> it'll<00:05:10.449> offer<00:05:10.659> some<00:05:10.960> really

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
small so it'll offer some really

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.499 
small so it'll offer some really
interesting<00:05:11.680> ground<00:05:12.310> choke<00:05:12.699> points<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.449> I'm

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
interesting ground choke points and I'm

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:14.999 
interesting ground choke points and I'm
really<00:05:14.020> looking<00:05:14.349> forward<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.650> seeing<00:05:14.860> how

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
really looking forward to seeing how

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.100 
really looking forward to seeing how
that<00:05:15.039> plays<00:05:15.490> out<00:05:15.819> now<00:05:16.300> once<00:05:16.509> the<00:05:16.629> tower<00:05:16.840> comes

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
that plays out now once the tower comes

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.839 
that plays out now once the tower comes
down<00:05:17.349> that<00:05:17.560> will<00:05:17.770> destroy<00:05:18.129> part<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.669> wall

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
down that will destroy part of the wall

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.089 
down that will destroy part of the wall
and<00:05:19.090> give<00:05:19.419> you<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.569> fourth<00:05:19.960> access<00:05:20.469> point<00:05:20.770> now

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
and give you a fourth access point now

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.070 
and give you a fourth access point now
the<00:05:21.159> wall<00:05:21.430> itself<00:05:21.789> is<00:05:22.000> actually<00:05:22.180> designed<00:05:22.870> to

the wall itself is actually designed to

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.529 
the wall itself is actually designed to

onto ground vehicles I can see this

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.860 
onto ground vehicles I can see this
being<00:06:00.129> a<00:06:00.279> very<00:06:00.580> very<00:06:00.849> powerful<00:06:01.090> defensive

structure also the ability to lock on to
air<00:06:04.539> vehicles<00:06:04.990> is<00:06:05.139> going<00:06:05.349> to<00:06:05.409> be<00:06:05.500> very

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
air vehicles is going to be very

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
powerful as well now again we notice

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.230 
powerful as well now again we notice
that<00:06:08.500> tanks<00:06:08.830> can<00:06:09.129> destroy<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.639> top<00:06:09.819> parts<00:06:10.120> of

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
that tanks can destroy the top parts of

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.209 
that tanks can destroy the top parts of
these<00:06:10.360> towers<00:06:10.750> but<00:06:11.139> you<00:06:11.289> can<00:06:11.440> also<00:06:11.560> move<00:06:12.009> along

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
these towers but you can also move along

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.850 
these towers but you can also move along
the<00:06:13.089> longer<00:06:13.810> part<00:06:13.990> of<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.229> wall<00:06:14.409> by<00:06:14.620> just

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
the longer part of the wall by just

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.829 
the longer part of the wall by just
going<00:06:14.979> down<00:06:15.279> one<00:06:15.610> level<00:06:15.879> and<00:06:16.089> although<00:06:16.509> it's

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:16.839 
going down one level and although it's

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.290 
going down one level and although it's
potentially<00:06:17.440> very<00:06:17.830> exposed<00:06:18.460> I<00:06:18.729> can<00:06:18.909> still<00:06:19.120> see

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
potentially very exposed I can still see

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.059 
potentially very exposed I can still see
this<00:06:19.479> area<00:06:19.810> being<00:06:20.050> a<00:06:20.139> great<00:06:20.409> place<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.919> launch

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
this area being a great place to launch

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.939 
this area being a great place to launch
stingers<00:06:21.669> and<00:06:21.879> get<00:06:22.659> the<00:06:22.779> initiative<00:06:23.349> on<00:06:23.650> some

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
stingers and get the initiative on some

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.610 
stingers and get the initiative on some
of<00:06:24.069> those<00:06:24.159> air<00:06:24.490> vehicles<00:06:25.060> so<00:06:25.509> overall<00:06:26.020> I<00:06:26.229> loved

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
of those air vehicles so overall I loved

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.709 
of those air vehicles so overall I loved
this<00:06:26.830> update<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.339> Caspian<00:06:28.029> border<00:06:28.360> I<00:06:28.389> can't

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
this update to Caspian border I can't

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.269 
this update to Caspian border I can't
wait<00:06:28.900> to<00:06:29.080> play<00:06:29.199> it<00:06:29.409> again<00:06:29.650> I<00:06:29.710> think<00:06:29.830> it's<00:06:30.129> one

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
wait to play it again I think it's one

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.129 
wait to play it again I think it's one
of<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.460> best<00:06:30.759> conquest<00:06:31.330> large<00:06:31.419> maps<00:06:31.900> for

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
of the best conquest large maps for

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.200 
of the best conquest large maps for
vehicle<00:06:32.589> and<00:06:32.770> infantry<00:06:33.250> combat<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:34.000> wall

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
vehicle and infantry combat the wall

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.390 
vehicle and infantry combat the wall
itself<00:06:34.690> may<00:06:34.990> favor<00:06:35.319> the<00:06:35.560> Russian<00:06:35.919> side<00:06:36.159> and

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
itself may favor the Russian side and

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.829 
itself may favor the Russian side and
we'll<00:06:36.550> really<00:06:36.759> just<00:06:36.909> have<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.300> play<00:06:37.479> a<00:06:37.509> lot<00:06:37.690> of

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:37.839 
we'll really just have to play a lot of

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.869 
we'll really just have to play a lot of
conquest<00:06:38.349> large<00:06:38.469> to<00:06:38.860> figure<00:06:39.190> it<00:06:39.339> out<00:06:39.490> they

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879 
conquest large to figure it out they

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:41.879 
conquest large to figure it out they
seem<00:06:40.120> to<00:06:40.240> remember<00:06:40.659> the<00:06:40.779> u.s.<00:06:41.080> winning<00:06:41.440> most

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
seem to remember the u.s. winning most

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.249 
seem to remember the u.s. winning most
of<00:06:42.159> the<00:06:42.310> conquest<00:06:42.699> games<00:06:43.120> on<00:06:43.360> Caspian<00:06:43.930> border

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
of the conquest games on Caspian border

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.110 
of the conquest games on Caspian border
so<00:06:44.469> hopefully<00:06:45.129> this<00:06:45.310> will<00:06:45.430> balance<00:06:45.879> things

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
so hopefully this will balance things

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.119 
so hopefully this will balance things
out<00:06:46.300> a<00:06:46.330> little<00:06:46.569> bit<00:06:46.810> more<00:06:47.080> this<00:06:47.529> is<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:47.889> first

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
out a little bit more this is the first

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.430 
out a little bit more this is the first
time<00:06:48.460> that<00:06:48.759> we're<00:06:48.969> able<00:06:49.150> to<00:06:49.330> experience<00:06:50.080> these

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
time that we're able to experience these

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.309 
time that we're able to experience these
conquest<00:06:51.190> large<00:06:51.339> maps<00:06:52.089> on<00:06:52.330> the<00:06:52.839> console

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
conquest large maps on the console

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.469 
conquest large maps on the console
systems<00:06:53.740> and<00:06:53.949> fill<00:06:54.339> them<00:06:54.550> out<00:06:54.669> with<00:06:54.909> 64

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
systems and fill them out with 64

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.269 
systems and fill them out with 64
players<00:06:55.870> and<00:06:56.169> it's<00:06:56.589> really<00:06:56.800> kind<00:06:56.979> of<00:06:57.129> an

00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:57.279 
players and it's really kind of an

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.790 
players and it's really kind of an
exciting<00:06:57.699> moment<00:06:58.149> because<00:06:59.080> this<00:06:59.349> is<00:06:59.529> sort<00:06:59.680> of

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
exciting moment because this is sort of

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.620 
exciting moment because this is sort of
the<00:06:59.979> foundation<00:07:00.639> for<00:07:00.819> battlefield<00:07:01.389> it's

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
the foundation for battlefield it's

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.339 
the foundation for battlefield it's
large<00:07:02.020> Maps<00:07:02.409> vehicle<00:07:03.250> oriented

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:04.349 
large Maps vehicle oriented

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.950 
large Maps vehicle oriented
infantry<00:07:05.009> oriented<00:07:05.639> also<00:07:06.030> and<00:07:06.360> this<00:07:06.840> is

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
infantry oriented also and this is

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.540 
infantry oriented also and this is
really<00:07:07.410> how<00:07:07.560> battlefield<00:07:08.129> kind<00:07:08.340> of<00:07:08.400> got

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
really how battlefield kind of got

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.339 
really how battlefield kind of got
started<00:07:09.000> and<00:07:09.180> I<00:07:09.270> feel<00:07:09.479> like<00:07:09.690> the<00:07:09.900> consoles

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.349 
started and I feel like the consoles

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:12.260
