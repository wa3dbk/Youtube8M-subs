a<00:03:05.800> lot<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.160> stuff

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
a lot of stuff

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.780 
a lot of stuff
and<00:03:07.470> you're<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.620> announcing<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.160> new<00:03:08.340> classes

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
and you're not announcing a new classes

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.370 
and you're not announcing a new classes
today<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.210> are<00:03:09.240> did<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.750> announce<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.200> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
today you are did you announce you and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.960 
today you are did you announce you and
now<00:03:10.440> some<00:03:10.710> new<00:03:10.890> announced<00:03:11.460> all<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.640> advanced

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
now some new announced all the advanced

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.580 
now some new announced all the advanced
classes<00:03:12.450> though<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.020> basic

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
classes though if you have a basic

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.840 
classes though if you have a basic
classes<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.400> advanced<00:03:14.670> class

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
classes and then the advanced class

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.090 
classes and then the advanced class
essentially<00:03:15.420> split<00:03:15.630> those<00:03:15.840> into<00:03:16.080> 16<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.010> then

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
essentially split those into 16 and then

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
essentially split those into 16 and then
the<00:03:17.220> skill<00:03:17.430> trees<00:03:17.670> Greg<00:03:17.910> mentioned

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the skill trees Greg mentioned

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.210 
the skill trees Greg mentioned
essentially<00:03:18.570> allowed<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:19.320> almost<00:03:19.560> infinite

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
essentially allowed like almost infinite

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.950 
essentially allowed like almost infinite
permutations<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.240> which<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.570> put<00:03:21.690> skill

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
permutations of like which to put skill

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.300 
permutations of like which to put skill
points<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.320> put<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.770> every<00:03:22.980> player<00:03:23.220> is

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
points you put in so every player is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.260 
points you put in so every player is
going<00:03:23.460> to<00:03:23.520> have<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> different<00:03:23.790> character

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
going to have a different character

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.300 
going to have a different character
essentially<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:25.650> know<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.860> choices<00:03:26.100> you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
essentially and you know the choices you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.470 
essentially and you know the choices you
make<00:03:26.340> add<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.790> extra<00:03:26.910> dimension<00:03:27.390> of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
make add that extra dimension of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.210 
make add that extra dimension of
customization<00:03:28.230> progression<00:03:28.650> because<00:03:29.010> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
customization progression because a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.160 
customization progression because a
story-driven<00:03:29.730> choice<00:03:30.210> your<00:03:30.810> hero's<00:03:31.140> journey

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
story-driven choice your hero's journey

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.240 
story-driven choice your hero's journey
is<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.770> be<00:03:31.830> different<00:03:32.010> than<00:03:32.220> your

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
is going to be different than your

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.500 
is going to be different than your
friends<00:03:32.640> even<00:03:32.850> if<00:03:32.910> you're<00:03:33.030> playing<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.330> same

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
friends even if you're playing the same

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.690 
friends even if you're playing the same
class<00:03:33.860> obviously<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:34.920> guys<00:03:35.010> are<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.220> block

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
class obviously you guys are just block

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.950 
class obviously you guys are just block

out there saying that this is a WoW
killer<00:03:37.350> but<00:03:37.620> certainly<00:03:37.890> there's<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.460> of

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
killer but certainly there's a lot of

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.160 
killer but certainly there's a lot of
potential<00:03:38.820> for<00:03:39.150> popularity<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.810> mean<00:03:40.020> there's

lot of anticipation I think you know one
thing<00:03:58.050> we<00:03:58.140> talked<00:03:58.380> about<00:03:58.410> new<00:03:58.710> research<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
thing we talked about new research the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.640 
thing we talked about new research the
MMO<00:04:00.300> market<00:04:00.690> general<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.260> that's<00:04:01.440> certainly

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
MMO market general like that's certainly

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.950 
MMO market general like that's certainly
the<00:04:01.710> guys<00:04:01.890> who<00:04:02.070> are<00:04:02.100> playing<00:04:02.760> mmos<00:04:03.120> actively<00:04:03.690> I

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
the guys who are playing mmos actively I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.170 
the guys who are playing mmos actively I
mean<00:04:04.500> it's<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.850> seventy-five<00:04:05.850> percent<00:04:06.000> or

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
mean it's the seventy-five percent or

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.550 
mean it's the seventy-five percent or
more<00:04:06.210> really<00:04:06.690> familiar<00:04:07.140> with<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.350> game<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
more really familiar with the game and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.850 
more really familiar with the game and
aware<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.490> lagos<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.300> higher<00:04:10.200> percentage<00:04:10.500> I

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
aware of it lagos a higher percentage I

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.250 
aware of it lagos a higher percentage I
again<00:04:11.070> tried<00:04:11.100> out<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:11.820> it's
