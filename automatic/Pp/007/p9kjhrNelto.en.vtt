00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
paper most do you know how to make the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.080 
paper most do you know how to make the
dark<00:01:00.840> normally<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> show<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
dark normally but I'm going to show you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.200 
dark normally but I'm going to show you
how<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> lot<00:01:03.809> better<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:05.150> go<00:01:06.150> ahead

how to make it a lot better so go ahead

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.010 
how to make it a lot better so go ahead
and<00:01:06.330> fold<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.930> piece<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> paper<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.950> half<00:01:09.020> hot

and fold your piece of paper in half hot

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.460 
and fold your piece of paper in half hot
dog<00:01:10.229> style<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.570> this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> most<00:01:12.930> important

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
part right here okay make sure it's a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.640 
part right here okay make sure it's a
good<00:01:18.990> crease<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.770> make<00:01:20.549> sure<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.909> straight

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
good crease and make sure it's straight

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
good crease and make sure it's straight
okay<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.240> ahead<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
okay now you're going to go ahead and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.819 
okay now you're going to go ahead and
take<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> back<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.380> top<00:01:25.770> corner<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.850> most

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
take the back of top corner now most

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
take the back of top corner now most
things<00:01:28.829> say<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.119> they<00:01:30.270> go

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
things say go like this and then they go

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219 
things say go like this and then they go
little<00:01:31.229> teepee<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.600> want<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> keep

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
little teepee thing I want you to keep

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
little teepee thing I want you to keep
it<00:01:34.409> folded<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.680> then<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> top<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it folded and then just take the top and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.160 
it folded and then just take the top and
fold<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:39.210> along<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.689> corner

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.660 

okay<00:01:46.550> now<00:01:47.550> flip<00:01:47.760> it<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.450> line<00:01:49.230> it<00:01:49.260> up

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
okay now flip it over and line it up

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.410 
okay now flip it over and line it up
symmetry<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:52.220> main<00:01:53.220> part<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.850> making

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
symmetry is the main part of making

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.900 
symmetry is the main part of making
paper<00:01:54.570> airplane<00:01:54.990> good<00:01:55.400> that's<00:01:56.400> what<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.760> need

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
paper airplane good that's what you need

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.990 
paper airplane good that's what you need
to<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:58.320> symmetrical<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.640> will<00:01:59.790> fly

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to know if it's symmetrical it will fly

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320 
to know if it's symmetrical it will fly
so<00:02:00.950> make<00:02:01.950> sure<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.160> it's<00:02:02.520> nice<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:02.970> pointy

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
so make sure that it's nice and pointy

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:12.620 
so make sure that it's nice and pointy
at<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.780> top<00:02:09.050> okay<00:02:10.460> now<00:02:11.460> just<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.360> ahead<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
at the top okay now just go ahead and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.520 
at the top okay now just go ahead and
bend<00:02:13.560> down<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.950> wings<00:02:14.130> without<00:02:14.610> opening<00:02:15.330> it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
bend down the wings without opening it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.710 
bend down the wings without opening it
just<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.680> ahead<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.940> take<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.120> corner<00:02:18.480> right

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
just go ahead and take this corner right

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
just go ahead and take this corner right
here<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.430> bring<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.760> bottom<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
here and bring it to the bottom so that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.500 
here and bring it to the bottom so that
it's<00:02:21.690> straight<00:02:22.650> along<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.190> line<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:29.510> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it's straight along this line and it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.330 
it's straight along this line and it
shouldn't<00:02:30.990> have<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
shouldn't have to go all the way to the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
shouldn't have to go all the way to the
edge<00:02:32.660> let's<00:02:33.660> see<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.960> all<00:02:34.320> right<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.620> that's

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
edge let's see that all right so that's

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
take a stapler and just go ahead and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.809 
take a stapler and just go ahead and
staple<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.120> right<00:03:48.900> about<00:03:49.970> there

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
staple that right about there

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.789 
staple that right about there
okay<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:52.689> like<00:03:52.989> right<00:03:53.230> before<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:55.799> little

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
okay so like right before this little

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.649 
okay so like right before this little
diagonal<00:03:57.459> okay<00:03:59.760> all<00:04:00.760> right<00:04:00.909> so<00:04:01.090> that's<00:04:01.209> how<00:04:01.480> it

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
diagonal okay all right so that's how it

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.110 
diagonal okay all right so that's how it
should<00:04:01.689> look<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.400> now<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.459> can<00:04:03.760> throw<00:04:04.030> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
should look and now you can throw it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.759 
should look and now you can throw it
right<00:04:04.239> now<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.659> it<00:04:05.260> would<00:04:05.349> do<00:04:05.469> pretty<00:04:05.650> good

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
right now and it would do pretty good

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.449 
right now and it would do pretty good
but<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.349> how<00:04:08.469> to<00:04:08.560> make<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.859> modified<00:04:09.280> one

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
flaps up it the plane will go up so you

flaps up it the plane will go up so you
what<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.719> want<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.080> right<00:05:50.349> about<00:05:50.560> here<00:05:50.889> and
