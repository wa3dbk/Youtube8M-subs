having trouble adjusting and the pace of

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.580 
having trouble adjusting and the pace of
the<00:02:34.299> game<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.600> just<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.840> different<00:02:35.109> and<00:02:35.380> on<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
the game is just so different and on the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.090 
the game is just so different and on the
old<00:02:35.769> maps<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:37.600> obvious<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.470> on

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
old maps it's so it's so obvious and on

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.770 
old maps it's so it's so obvious and on
one<00:02:39.340> hand<00:02:39.549> it's<00:02:39.700> great<00:02:39.910> because<00:02:40.359> you<00:02:40.540> could

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
one hand it's great because you could

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.630 
one hand it's great because you could
get<00:02:40.959> like<00:02:41.140> 30<00:02:41.440> kills<00:02:41.859> and<00:02:42.220> under<00:02:42.430> four<00:02:42.609> minutes

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
get like 30 kills and under four minutes

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.130 
get like 30 kills and under four minutes
and<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.180> games<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.810> because<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and have games like this because the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.009 
and have games like this because the
pace<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.530> just<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:45.549> much<00:02:45.670> faster<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
pace is just so much faster but on the

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.449 
pace is just so much faster but on the
other<00:02:47.109> hand<00:02:47.200> it's<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.859> departure<00:02:48.250> from

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
other hand it's just a departure from

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.880 
other hand it's just a departure from
something<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:48.970> many<00:02:49.090> people<00:02:49.420> love<00:02:49.890> hopefully
