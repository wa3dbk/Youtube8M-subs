00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello everyone Bender and today we are 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 we will deal with one enough 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 funny thing namely we will 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.340
 find dismember small animals 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.190
 cut one whole pieces and fry it 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.719
 meat and and there urgently fun I'll tell you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.719
 so let's start 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.910
 Well, something like this now let's you 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.519
 tell you how to do all these things we 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.149
 let's roast the cow now and let me 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.489
 teach 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.739
 you need to do the first thing you 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.399
 you need the main tool of blue 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.009
 Mystic 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.920
 namely the cleaver is a real cleaver and 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.630
 Kraft he follows whoever 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.970
 might think minecraft can be crafted 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.950
 cleaver something is required 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.170
 four slightly iron one stick 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.020
 lay out such a composition get 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.360
 the real meat cleaver further us 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.640
 need one more leg this is a knife 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.009
 sirloin but actually more like 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.710
 for sharpening but nonetheless crafting it 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.409
 from two iron bars and one shelf 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.659
 the following items we need a hook 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.000
 on which we will hang the most animal 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.270
 this hook is not working here 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.350
 and now I'll show you how to be beautiful 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.729
 real hook and for that to me 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.340
 will need to take this hook 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.350
 from creative mode from i already took this circle 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.970
 here I have it and let's 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.330
 look kraftitsya this hook 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.280
 of four iron ingots we get 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.040
 this hook and the following subjects us 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.810
 need to craft a skewer on which we 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.780
 We will fry Shapur paint very 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.969
 simple and the next thing is even 2 of them 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.009
 will have to craft this skewer feet 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.979
 and they craft just as easily and 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.260
 slept and now it's time to kill 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.470
 the animal that you want to fry and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.360
 let it be that cow come here come 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.760
 Ladybug here we will kill you 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.280
 Butcher's knife is very, very long 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.590
 and it hurts so you better not even 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.410
 resist just die and and after all 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.470
 so it will probably be easier voila now we 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.260
 killed the cows and for some reason we fell 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.769
 unaccustomed cuts of meat and dead 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.660
 cow 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.760
 that is, we basically carry it now 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.190
 dead cow on his hump well or 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.410
 somehow so further we need to hang it 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.400
 on the hook if you want and hang on the circle 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.090
 for example i want 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.550
 and 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.330
 and we just put the hook here somewhere 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.209
 here for example 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.769
 near iron but on any block principle 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.930
 can only be put on ice 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.319
 put on we just take this 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.849
 the cow and hang it uk upside down 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.830
 looks like this and 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.049
 it's funny enough i'll tell you 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.610
 further we will need to skin this 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.720
 the cow and for that just need 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.390
 that same 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.519
 sirloin we stalk we just come to 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.220
 her and the pumpkin right click on it 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.170
 thereby removing all her skin 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.049
 from it you can then make different armor 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.970
 well, or what you need next is now 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.190
 two options either take it off and start 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.269
 fatten or cut it into pieces with 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.069
 using this knife 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.230
 if you cut it you just 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.319
 meat will fall out which can be later 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.120
 fry in the oven but if you decide it 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.310
 take off and let me show you how it is 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.620
 working for this will not need yet 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.560
 one dead cow let's take from 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.750
 creative regime and hang in the same way and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.790
 so here it is a cow we are hanging now we 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.650
 remove all skin from it and now we 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.670
 just hit it until 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.680
 she won't fall out 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.930
 she fell to us and now we can her 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.760
 quietly fry for that 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.060
 for this we need time 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.650
 those two coasters for our skewers 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.109
 lay them out like this and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.090
 now we put this skewer but unfortunately 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.519
 it does not always work the first time 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.049
 need to choose exactly which stand 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.299
 sometimes you have to poke 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.030
 many many times but voila with us 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.190
 put this skewer over the fire 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.980
 next we need to put ours on it 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.500
 the cow we did it and now we need 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.669
 rotate rotate a cow because she 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.950
 can before roasting 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.710
 and after a while the cow will 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.380
 on fire let me immediately rewind to 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.620
 this moment did not pass even five seconds and 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.770
 cows are ready and you can, and quietly 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.900
 cut with a knife and we get right away 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.270
 the finished meat is such a mod 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.849
 we have friends today to me personally this mod 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.099
 really liked it because you can cut 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.000
 kill shred and do a lot of things 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.039
 interesting 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.530
 I hope you this mod in the same way 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.849
 Like the conclusion I will say that for sure 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.429
 can also deal with pigs 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.259
 example or zombie yes friends can be here 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:55.249
 hang a zombie on a circle let's you 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.830
 show you how it looks 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:01.009
 yes it looks like the following 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.559
 way so matters me zombies corpse zombies and 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.929
 voila he doesnâ€™t hang himself because he 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:08.479
 need more space so we have to 

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:11.029
 hang our cube a little higher take it 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.309
 where I have this cube so friends let me 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:16.159
 again take it from the creative mode of 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:19.279
 side menu for this change here 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.379
 let's decide and where is this hook 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.990
 here's a meat hook and let's hang it 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:27.019
 a little higher here and try to hang 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.149
 This is beyond the orbit and voila zombies are suspended 

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:31.639
 on the hook here is such a funny moment 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:33.469
 unfortunately it is impossible to cut it but 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.819
 no less here such moments in this 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:39.769
 fashion is just as possible to do 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.169
 pig as I said before and even with 

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:44.869
 Chicken well, in principle, the process is not 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.959
 different absolutely nothing but on this one 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:49.909
 In principle, everything except that meat can 

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.080
 spoil this moment to me very 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.449
 liked that mod 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.089
 if you keep long and meat in the chest 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.879
 then over time it can go wrong and 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:01.669
 so that it does not deteriorate you will need 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.469
 make a special fridge yes yes 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.199
 it is a refrigerator and this refrigerator 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:08.389
 crafting as follows 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.169
 ice I honestly can not even imagine 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.899
 how do you like it 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.849
 need to drink i need iron 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:16.430
 ordinary chest put it somewhere 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:19.550
 right here and inside you can put everything 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.709
 your meat which is fire on not fire on 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.499
 in general this is a place to store meat and 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:26.779
 there she will never spoil everything with him 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:27.139
 it will be ok and so can she 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.179
 rot 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.610
 up to really can rot and rotten 

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:33.589
 meat I'll tell you this is not very tasty in 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.079
 In general, here is such a mod friends with you 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:39.979
 was bender subscribe to our channel 

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:41.719
 otherwise the butcher with a cleaver will have to 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.789
 something like that do not forget to put likes 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:46.159
 because it helps me more 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.929
 likes more desire to make videos and 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.599
 send this video to your friends if you 

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:52.610
 like it and now everything has come 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.729
 time to jump over the fire to everyone 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.729
 until
