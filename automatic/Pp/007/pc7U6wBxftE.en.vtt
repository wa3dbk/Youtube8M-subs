minimum<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.890> zero<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.049> really<00:02:18.049> we<00:02:18.200> were

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
minimum here is zero and really we were

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.640 
minimum here is zero and really we were
looking<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:18.860> from<00:02:19.239> 86,000<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:21.019> George<00:02:21.349> made

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
looking at from 86,000 that George made

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.390 
looking at from 86,000 that George made
and<00:02:22.660> 52,000<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.470> gene<00:02:24.799> was<00:02:24.920> made<00:02:25.160> and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
and 52,000 that that gene was made and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.430 
and 52,000 that that gene was made and
we<00:02:26.090> want<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.750> want<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.989> kind<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.260> get<00:02:27.410> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
we want to we want to kind of get a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.289 
we want to we want to kind of get a
better<00:02:27.620> picture<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> do<00:02:29.060> is

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
better picture of that so what you do is

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:38.220 
better picture of that so what you do is
you<00:02:29.959> double<00:02:30.319> click<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.799> these<00:02:31.340> numbers

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.010 

like<00:02:38.410> computers<00:02:38.830> being<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.160> little<00:02:39.370> slow<00:02:40.020> and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
like computers being a little slow and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.190 
like computers being a little slow and
click<00:02:41.290> on

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
click on

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.089 
click on
and<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.439> notice<00:02:43.739> here<00:02:43.920> there's

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
and you notice here there's

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.960 
and you notice here there's
minimum/maximum<00:02:44.670> major<00:02:45.510> unit<00:02:46.019> minor<00:02:46.260> unit

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
minimum/maximum major unit minor unit

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.149 
minimum/maximum major unit minor unit
what<00:02:47.970> we're<00:02:48.090> looking<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.689> minimum<00:02:49.200> minimum

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
what we're looking at is minimum minimum

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.800 
what we're looking at is minimum minimum
is<00:02:50.340> zero<00:02:50.610> now<00:02:51.569> gene<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.170> made<00:02:52.409> what<00:02:53.480> 52,000<00:02:54.480> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
is zero now gene was made what 52,000 so

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.240 
is zero now gene was made what 52,000 so
if<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.260> want<00:02:55.439> to<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.799> chart<00:02:56.129> look

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
if I really want to make this chart look

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.869 
if I really want to make this chart look
really<00:02:56.790> dramatic<00:02:57.299> i<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:58.079> make<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.409> minimum

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
really dramatic i can make the minimum

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.530 
really dramatic i can make the minimum
50,000<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.829> that<00:03:01.829> will<00:03:02.010> really<00:03:02.250> show<00:03:02.610> who's

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
50,000 and that will really show who's

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.470 
50,000 and that will really show who's
on<00:03:03.720> top<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.019> who's<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.879> now<00:03:06.450> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
on top and who's not see that now that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.920 
on top and who's not see that now that
the<00:03:06.840> minimum<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.349> 50,000<00:03:08.329> Jane<00:03:09.329> was<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.720> Matt

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the minimum is 50,000 Jane was and Matt

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.569 
the minimum is 50,000 Jane was and Matt
looks<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.260> they<00:03:10.470> did<00:03:10.709> very<00:03:10.980> very<00:03:11.069> poorly

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
looks like they did very very poorly

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.360 
looks like they did very very poorly
this<00:03:11.879> month<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.530> Bob<00:03:13.530> seems<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.190> doing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
this month and Bob seems to be doing

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.539 
this month and Bob seems to be doing
okay<00:03:14.760> stay<00:03:15.230> stand<00:03:16.230> better<00:03:16.470> Luis<00:03:16.950> better<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
okay stay stand better Luis better and

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.260 
okay stay stand better Luis better and
George's<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.870> top

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
George's is on top

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.050 
George's is on top
and<00:03:20.990> that's<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.440> very<00:03:21.470> very<00:03:22.400> easy<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.850> read

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
and that's a very very easy to read

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.050 
and that's a very very easy to read
chart<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.930> 3d<00:03:24.470> looking<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.730> gives<00:03:25.940> you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060

all that pertinent information you need
it's<00:03:28.490> very<00:03:28.520> simple<00:03:29.060> now<00:03:29.210> there's<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.540> lot<00:03:30.050> of

different options here you could do pie

you guys to mess around and play with it
but<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.710> wanted<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.070> give<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.580> a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
but I just wanted to give you a just a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.320 
but I just wanted to give you a just a
brief<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:45.260> quick<00:03:45.650> overview<00:03:46.460> of<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.910> charts

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
brief and a quick overview of the charts

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.300 
brief and a quick overview of the charts
this<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:47.960> probably<00:03:48.260> one<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.560> most<00:03:48.770> common

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
this is probably one of the most common

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.850 
this is probably one of the most common
types<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.730> charts<00:03:50.090> you'll<00:03:50.810> use<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:51.320> this<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.650> a

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
types of charts you'll use in this in a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.700 
types of charts you'll use in this in a
scenario<00:03:52.220> where<00:03:52.610> you're<00:03:52.760> showing<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.710> quick

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
scenario where you're showing a quick

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.360 
scenario where you're showing a quick
glance<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.340> who's<00:03:56.210> done<00:03:56.510> what<00:03:56.810> if<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.920> highlight

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
glance of who's done what if I highlight

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.030 
glance of who's done what if I highlight
it<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.700> mean<00:03:58.940> if<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.230> hover<00:04:00.230> over<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.710> it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
it I mean if I just hover over it it

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.770 
it I mean if I just hover over it it
shows<00:04:01.310> me<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> value

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
shows me the value

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.020 
shows me the value
because<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.040> can't<00:04:05.280> really<00:04:05.460> tell<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.970> by

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
because you can't really tell just by

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
because you can't really tell just by
looking<00:04:06.390> at<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.630> increments<00:04:07.170> here<00:04:07.250> but

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
looking at the increments here but

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.550 
looking at the increments here but
that's<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.640> it's<00:04:08.880> pretty<00:04:09.120> cool<00:04:09.320> if<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.410> have

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
that's it it's pretty cool if you have

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.290 
that's it it's pretty cool if you have
any<00:04:10.710> questions<00:04:11.160> or<00:04:11.340> any<00:04:11.490> comments<00:04:11.760> leave<00:04:12.180> them

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
any questions or any comments leave them

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.660 
any questions or any comments leave them
for<00:04:12.600> me<00:04:12.740> if<00:04:13.740> there's<00:04:13.920> anything<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.430> want

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
for me if there's anything that you want

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.220 
for me if there's anything that you want
me<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.880> do<00:04:15.060> for<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.630> if<00:04:15.780> there's<00:04:15.960> something

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
me to do for you if there's something

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.599 
me to do for you if there's something
that<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.470> really<00:04:16.680> want<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:16.980> do<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.400> can't

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
that you really want to do and you can't

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.890 
that you really want to do and you can't
figure<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.000> out

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
figure it out
