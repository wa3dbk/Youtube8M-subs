hello this is James universe with a
nother<00:00:03.120> mock<00:00:03.360> showcase<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.370> four

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
nother mock showcase this is the four

nother mock showcase this is the four
horses<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.690> Apocalypse<00:00:07.069> this<00:00:08.069> was<00:00:08.309> for<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
horses of the Apocalypse this was for a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.680 
horses of the Apocalypse this was for a
contest<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.360> while<00:00:09.570> back<00:00:09.920> and<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.540> just<00:00:12.540> now

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
contest a while back and I just now

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.289 
contest a while back and I just now
getting<00:00:12.929> around<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.320> recording<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.299> will

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
getting around to recording it I will

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.849 
getting around to recording it I will
probably<00:00:15.540> put<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:17.720> image<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.230> finished

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
probably put a image of the finished

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.340 
probably put a image of the finished
model<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.609> display<00:00:21.180> stand<00:00:21.689> right<00:00:22.080> about

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
model with the display stand right about

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.670 
model with the display stand right about
now<00:00:25.220> okay<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.029> let's<00:00:27.060> look<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> horses<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
now okay so let's look at the horses I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.050 
now okay so let's look at the horses I
took<00:00:29.010> apart<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> base<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> not

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
took apart the base because it's not

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.550 
took apart the base because it's not
very<00:00:30.269> complex<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.170> probably<00:00:31.349> tell

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
very complex and you can probably tell

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.170 
very complex and you can probably tell
how<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> built<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.640> by<00:00:32.730> looking<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
how I built it just by looking at the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
how I built it just by looking at the
picture<00:00:33.710> but<00:00:35.210> I'll<00:00:36.210> look<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> they're<00:00:37.800> all

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
picture but I'll look at the they're all

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.000 
picture but I'll look at the they're all
basically<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.460> same<00:00:38.579> horse<00:00:39.590> I'm<00:00:40.590> gonna<00:00:40.800> show

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
basically the same horse I'm gonna show

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.869 
basically the same horse I'm gonna show
you<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.610> easiest<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you the one that's easiest to see and I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
you the one that's easiest to see and I
just<00:00:45.090> broke<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.500> yay<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> gray

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
just broke one yay this is the gray

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
just broke one yay this is the gray
horse<00:00:48.469> these<00:00:49.469> horses<00:00:49.829> took<00:00:50.280> about<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:51.770> few

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
horse these horses took about a few

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.330 
horse these horses took about a few
hours<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.489> design<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.469> about<00:00:55.469> an<00:00:55.680> hour<00:00:55.949> each

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
hours to design and about an hour each

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.299 
hours to design and about an hour each
two<00:00:56.699> hour<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> half<00:00:57.780> each<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.350> replicate<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
two hour and a half each to replicate so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.840 
two hour and a half each to replicate so
basically<00:00:59.640> make<00:00:59.910> again<00:01:01.219> they<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> whole

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
basically make again they use a whole

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.630 
basically make again they use a whole
lot<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.120> cheese<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.930> snot<00:01:04.769> technique<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
lot of cheese and snot technique it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.899 
lot of cheese and snot technique it's
not<00:01:05.820> techniques<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.260> can't<00:01:07.650> talk<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.040> today

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
not techniques I can't talk really today

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.310 
not techniques I can't talk really today
but<00:01:09.720> um<00:01:10.880> they<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.950> they<00:01:13.950> use<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:15.320> 450

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
but um they are they use like about 450

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
but um they are they use like about 450
to<00:01:16.350> 500<00:01:16.950> pieces<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.400> believe<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:18.180> actually

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to 500 pieces I believe that's actually

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.660 
to 500 pieces I believe that's actually
quite<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> those<00:01:20.400> pieces

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
quite a lot but a lot of those pieces

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
quite a lot but a lot of those pieces
are<00:01:22.880> countess<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.390> small<00:01:24.689> pieces<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.170> one

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
are countess for small pieces like one

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.499 
are countess for small pieces like one
by<00:01:25.830> ones<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.549> cheese<00:01:27.299> slopes<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:28.490> very<00:01:29.509> small

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
by ones or cheese slopes or very small

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.800 
by ones or cheese slopes or very small
pieces<00:01:31.189> each<00:01:32.189> horse<00:01:32.549> comes<00:01:32.880> apart<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.329> modular

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
pieces each horse comes apart in modular

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.030 
pieces each horse comes apart in modular
sections<00:01:34.220> sections<00:01:36.439> as<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
sections sections as you can see the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.060 
sections sections as you can see the
side<00:01:38.280> panels<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> few<00:01:41.100> pieces<00:01:41.390> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
side panels it's just a few pieces and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.819 
side panels it's just a few pieces and
they<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.100> attach<00:01:44.720> different<00:01:45.720> panels<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
they all attach different panels the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
they all attach different panels the
legs<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:48.119> stomach<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.500> back<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.280> head<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
legs the stomach the back the head and a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.319 
legs the stomach the back the head and a
few<00:01:52.290> other<00:01:52.409> areas<00:01:52.820> also<00:01:53.840> come<00:01:54.840> off<00:01:56.329> there's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
few other areas also come off there's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.200 
few other areas also come off there's
the<00:01:57.540> bottom<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.610> still<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> figure<00:02:00.149> out

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the bottom I still have to figure out

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.319 
the bottom I still have to figure out
what<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> add<00:02:01.170> add<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.479> area<00:02:03.780> but

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
what I want to add add to that area but

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
what I want to add add to that area but
that's<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:06.689> displayed<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> don't

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that's not really displayed so I don't

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
that's not really displayed so I don't
really<00:02:07.979> need<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.280> change<00:02:08.759> anything<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.330> now

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
really need to change anything right now

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410 
really need to change anything right now
the<00:02:10.560> head<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:11.310> actually<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:11.849> hard<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:12.390> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the head was actually very hard but I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.650 
the head was actually very hard but I
think<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.780> turned<00:02:12.989> out<00:02:13.140> pretty

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
think it turned out pretty

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.000 
think it turned out pretty
great<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:16.030> uses<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.840> all<00:02:17.290> should<00:02:17.590> take<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.860> head

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
great it uses a all should take the head

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.890 
great it uses a all should take the head
off<00:02:18.040> there's<00:02:18.580> another<00:02:18.730> head<00:02:19.000> section<00:02:21.900> take

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
off there's another head section take

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.970 
off there's another head section take
the<00:02:23.050> pieces<00:02:23.260> off<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.290> focus<00:02:28.980> there

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the pieces off now if I can focus there

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.710 
the pieces off now if I can focus there
we<00:02:30.070> go

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
we go

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.310 
we go
