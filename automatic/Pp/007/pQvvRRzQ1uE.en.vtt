00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.720
 so hi everyone so we end up 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.309
 on the tnt mano channel live the game 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 my own to nice 2 t she does 24 and 2 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:53.940
 or bible so present yourself so go ahead 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:56.039
 present yourself here so here is so in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800
 do the trick it says it's to try 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 to get on the truck already so on the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 hood so in fact you put in little 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.590
 near here you sprint and you you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 try to ride on it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 so it's pretty complicated but you 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.790
 go see it's going to lead to something 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.409
 rather pretty well so go mobile you 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.340
 more experience finally you know better 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:38.070
 the beak that me yeah finally when we 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:40.500
 goes on the container yeah so so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.049
 already to start so so here's 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.659
 here you can mount others so there 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.610
 it's pretty good for slate is 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.979
 then little tricks so you go up 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.810
 on the railing and where you jump 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.360
 so that you land on the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 container on the container my case it's 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.420
 rather not bad 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:06.020
 So here already it will go on 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.399
 pickup truck if you want and so that's it 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:15.420
 we will try to go on that so 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:28.940
 So here we already have that mobile tag 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 still not poston who opposed him 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.250
 so already actually the bug so it's from 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.620
 succeed him went up on the truck 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.170
 'keep' on the hood we do not know 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.540
 a mourning then you will climb on 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:08.570
 the roof and then you'll see a little 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:12.320
 and above the halls is true maybe 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:29.090
 not better with a package that's in the name 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:33.890
 do not move too much pity you're ok so we're going 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:43.580
 continue so shows us so you 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:44.150
 go where she is here so it's 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.450
 rather not bad 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.690
 here and so after and mobile so 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.160
 will come to do that you will present the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.100
 tactical that's something pretty 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 stylus to come back are bété like that 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:16.100
 except I thought that what cost ah 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.390
 yes So here we go he managed as 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.540
 you see it at mettet system benefits 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:29.620
 in which no it does not carry big 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.620
 thing but so here are the practices 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.740
 it's good it's good here it is not the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.990
 short now 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.830
 so here is a first part 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.730
 so rides on the truck on the hood 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.730
 so then a little consultation 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:05:16.099
 So here you have understood the purpose 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:19.009
 it's getting on the heap pickup truck 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.629
 to be able to go to put you on this 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.759
 robert green 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.889
 do not try to put yourself on this 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:29.029
 gray beige robot game because you 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:33.199
 will go through so that is there are you 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:36.050
 successful so you put a little edge 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.069
 but not so much so he managed in 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.469
 four attacks 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:50.839
 so that's it so he succeeded so he's 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:59.809
 positioned there so here it is a beautiful 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:06:01.879
 little bug here so if you want you 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.669
 put on these two robots you do not 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:07.519
 you can not go through 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:11.209
 so that's the first thing 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:17.809
 in sears tomatoes bronn and you lose your 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:24.169
 mobile trophy system so charles 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:25.519
 mess around so that's it going to you 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.629
 so show no need to try to 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:31.159
 jump on that because you've spent 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:33.759
 through this is so I change equipped 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.759
 mobile 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.080
 what is it so it will change 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.160
 team 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.160
 so you reappeared 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.710
 so he's here so here comes we did not 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.450
 than to do it here so the thing is 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.450
 cortes you take your system too 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:08.740
 fine and that's it and that's it 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:08.740
 so transforms so this is for this cable 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:20.200
 so that's the end of this video 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:29.000
 so finally if the end is here 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:31.850
 and so after that we can say 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.470
 that I video you and finish so we will see 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:44.330
 theirs and they calm down here she 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:47.120
