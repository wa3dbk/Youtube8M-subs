00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.690 
up into in between some cones there's a
big<00:02:09.119> blowup<00:02:09.709> dinosaur<00:02:10.709> behind<00:02:11.100> us<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.520> we're

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
big blowup dinosaur behind us and we're

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.280 
big blowup dinosaur behind us and we're
gonna<00:02:11.820> look<00:02:11.940> at<00:02:12.120> our<00:02:12.209> backup<00:02:12.660> camera<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> see

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
gonna look at our backup camera to see

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.530 
gonna look at our backup camera to see
if<00:02:13.320> any<00:02:13.500> alarms<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.580> off<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:15.030> indicators

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
if any alarms go off or indicators

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
if any alarms go off or indicators
because<00:02:15.660> there<00:02:16.260> probably<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.070> some<00:02:17.100> radar

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
because there probably is some radar

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.699 
because there probably is some radar
sensors<00:02:18.480> around<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.870> car<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.290> let's<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:19.620> in

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
sensors around this car so let's get in

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:30.310 
sensors around this car so let's get in
position<00:02:27.800> put<00:02:28.800> her<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.040> Reverse

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
position put her in Reverse

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.260 
position put her in Reverse
there's<00:02:31.320> our<00:02:31.530> teeny<00:02:31.950> backup<00:02:32.430> camera<00:02:32.730> 4.2

test good lane lines but no alarms went
off<00:03:07.670> time<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.760> do<00:03:08.910> our<00:03:09.150> cone<00:03:09.989> test<00:03:10.290> we'll<00:03:10.739> go

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
off time to do our cone test we'll go

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.410 
off time to do our cone test we'll go
about<00:03:11.010> 20<00:03:11.310> miles<00:03:11.489> per<00:03:11.610> hour<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:12.060> between<00:03:12.120> these

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
about 20 miles per hour in between these

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.759 
about 20 miles per hour in between these
cones<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.870> pickup<00:03:13.140> truck<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.410> see<00:03:13.620> how

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
cones in the pickup truck and see how

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:22.050 
cones in the pickup truck and see how
how<00:03:14.400> sturdy<00:03:14.730> she<00:03:15.000> is

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.000 

both<00:03:23.060> hands<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.450> wheel<00:03:23.629> a<00:03:23.870> lot<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.709> body

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
both hands on the wheel a lot of body

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.130 
both hands on the wheel a lot of body
roll<00:03:25.129> I<00:03:25.310> think<00:03:25.609> I'm<00:03:25.730> maybe<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.659> 20<00:03:26.870> miles<00:03:27.019> per

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
roll I think I'm maybe the 20 miles per

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.520 
roll I think I'm maybe the 20 miles per
hour<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.409> too<00:03:27.530> fast<00:03:27.739> for<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:30.019> how<00:03:30.170> often

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
hour is too fast for this but how often

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.780 
hour is too fast for this but how often
are<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.650> taking<00:03:30.950> your<00:03:31.010> pickup<00:03:31.370> truck<00:03:31.519> your

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
are you taking your pickup truck your

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.729 
are you taking your pickup truck your
work<00:03:31.969> truck<00:03:32.299> on<00:03:32.569> something<00:03:33.230> like<00:03:33.349> this<00:03:33.500> I

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
work truck on something like this I

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.289 
work truck on something like this I
don't<00:03:33.890> know<00:03:33.980> all<00:03:34.489> right<00:03:34.549> let's<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:34.939> test<00:03:35.239> out

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
don't know all right let's just test out

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.899 
don't know all right let's just test out
the<00:03:35.390> brakes<00:03:36.189> 40<00:03:37.189> miles<00:03:37.340> per<00:03:37.430> hour<00:03:37.609> then<00:03:37.700> we<00:03:37.790> hit

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
the brakes 40 miles per hour then we hit

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.780 
the brakes 40 miles per hour then we hit
the<00:03:37.969> brakes<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:43.280> know<00:03:43.310> it's<00:03:43.459> about<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.639> right

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the brakes you know it's about the right

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.459 
the brakes you know it's about the right
distance<00:03:43.849> from<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.569> other<00:03:44.750> pickup<00:03:45.109> trucks<00:03:45.349> I

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469 
distance from the other pickup trucks I

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.369 
distance from the other pickup trucks I
was<00:03:45.620> going<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:46.120> little<00:03:47.120> jumpy<00:03:47.659> a<00:03:47.810> little<00:03:48.260> more

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
was going a little jumpy a little more

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.399 
was going a little jumpy a little more
skid<00:03:48.739> than<00:03:49.010> previous<00:03:50.349> experiences<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:53.780> we

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
skid than previous experiences now we

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.830 
skid than previous experiences now we
will<00:03:54.560> find<00:03:54.859> out<00:03:55.099> how<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.579> accelerates<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.689> is

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
will find out how it accelerates this is

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.990 
will find out how it accelerates this is
a<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.349> know<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:57.620> big<00:03:58.189> hype<00:03:58.370> about<00:03:58.519> this<00:03:58.730> truck

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
a you know the big hype about this truck

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.339 
a you know the big hype about this truck
is<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.329> now<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.569> has<00:03:59.689> an<00:03:59.810> aluminum<00:03:59.959> frame

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
is that now it has an aluminum frame

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.379 
is that now it has an aluminum frame
it's<00:04:00.739> 700<00:04:01.220> pounds<00:04:01.459> lighter<00:04:01.700> than<00:04:01.849> last<00:04:02.060> year's

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
it's 700 pounds lighter than last year's

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.159 
it's 700 pounds lighter than last year's
let's<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.139> if<00:04:03.260> it<00:04:03.409> feels<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:04.129> way<00:04:04.189> three<00:04:05.169> two

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
let's see if it feels that way three two

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:12.339 
let's see if it feels that way three two
one<00:04:06.650> go<00:04:09.069> lots<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.159> decent<00:04:10.400> acceleration<00:04:10.909> 40<00:04:11.840> 45

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
one go lots of decent acceleration 40 45

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.770 
one go lots of decent acceleration 40 45
50<00:04:12.829> 55<00:04:14.859> wow<00:04:15.859> that's<00:04:16.130> pretty<00:04:16.220> good

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
50 55 wow that's pretty good

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.969 
50 55 wow that's pretty good
lot<00:04:17.780> more<00:04:18.019> so<00:04:18.320> than<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.039> RAM<00:04:19.220> 1500<00:04:19.729> in<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.389> GMC

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
lot more so than the RAM 1500 in the GMC

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.379 
lot more so than the RAM 1500 in the GMC
Canyon<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.160> drove<00:04:22.430> earlier<00:04:22.669> in<00:04:23.090> terms<00:04:23.240> of

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
Canyon that I drove earlier in terms of

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.070 
Canyon that I drove earlier in terms of
the<00:04:23.479> pickup<00:04:23.840> category<00:04:24.289> or<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.009> Toyota<00:04:25.340> Tundra

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
the pickup category or the Toyota Tundra

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.450 
the pickup category or the Toyota Tundra
so<00:04:27.080> when<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.380> comes<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.590> acceleration<00:04:28.099> this

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
so when it comes to acceleration this

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.080 
so when it comes to acceleration this
one<00:04:28.840> tops<00:04:29.840> those<00:04:30.110> other<00:04:30.380> three<00:04:30.740> but<00:04:31.490> every<00:04:31.760> car

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
one tops those other three but every car

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.120 
one tops those other three but every car
every<00:04:32.449> truck<00:04:32.720> has<00:04:32.750> its<00:04:33.110> strengths<00:04:33.530> hey

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
every truck has its strengths hey

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
every truck has its strengths hey
