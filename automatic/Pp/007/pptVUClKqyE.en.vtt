we<00:00:31.470> got<00:00:31.590> rims<00:00:31.830> no<00:00:32.820> wait<00:00:33.030> no<00:00:33.360> wings<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> guess

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
we got rims no wait no wings so I guess

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.930 
we got rims no wait no wings so I guess
something<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.980> could<00:00:35.160> try<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.460> putting<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
something we could try is putting the

something we could try is putting the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
new stickers on so I believe they've

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.930

added<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:37.770> new<00:00:38.010> stickers<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> game

camera there no it's pretty cool so it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.270

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
force feedback that means it's going to

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.600

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
should be less than 10 minutes so I'm

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.920 
should be less than 10 minutes so I'm
gonna<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.400> with<00:03:14.579> bounce<00:03:14.850> word<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.540> says<00:03:15.810> I've

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
gonna go with bounce word it says I've

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.680 
gonna go with bounce word it says I've
got<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.079> half<00:03:16.290> an<00:03:16.470> hour<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.650> do<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.150> no<00:03:18.150> idea<00:03:18.569> if

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
got a half an hour to do it no idea if

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.240 
got a half an hour to do it no idea if
it<00:03:18.780> takes<00:03:18.930> less<00:03:19.109> than<00:03:19.230> 10<00:03:19.380> minutes<00:03:19.620> well<00:03:20.069> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
it takes less than 10 minutes well I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.920 
it takes less than 10 minutes well I
guess<00:03:20.430> they're<00:03:20.609> just<00:03:20.639> they<00:03:21.209> want<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.480> handhold

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
guess they're just they want to handhold

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.530 
guess they're just they want to handhold
people<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.889> we're<00:03:23.040> gonna<00:03:23.160> give<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.579> go<00:03:23.760> in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
people so we're gonna give it a go in

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.420 
people so we're gonna give it a go in
the<00:03:24.989> works<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.530> how<00:03:25.560> we<00:03:25.769> do<00:03:25.859> how<00:03:25.980> many<00:03:26.160> years

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the works see how we do how many years

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.830 
the works see how we do how many years
is<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.670> thing<00:03:26.880> go<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.180> really<00:03:27.510> want<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> know

is this thing go I really want to know

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.430 
is this thing go I really want to know
that<00:03:27.989> as<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.260> got<00:03:28.410> six<00:03:28.680> years<00:03:28.980> let's<00:03:29.489> find<00:03:29.880> out

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
that as you got six years let's find out

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.539 
that as you got six years let's find out
probably<00:03:31.440> doesn't<00:03:31.739> need<00:03:31.829> them<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.310> honest

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
probably doesn't need them to be honest

at it this is this is not a car this is
a<00:03:54.180> spaceship<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.200> I'm<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.440> little<00:03:55.590> disappointed

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
a spaceship so I'm a little disappointed

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.199 
a spaceship so I'm a little disappointed
as<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.430> said<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.669> doesn't<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.090> any

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
as I said it doesn't have any

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.500 
as I said it doesn't have any
customization<00:03:58.049> parts<00:03:58.440> that's<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.829> real

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
customization parts that's a real

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.690 
customization parts that's a real
huge<00:03:59.930> shame<00:04:00.290> for<00:04:00.560> me<00:04:00.650> like<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:01.370> one<00:04:01.549> of<00:04:01.640> the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
huge shame for me like this one of the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.979 
huge shame for me like this one of the
reasons<00:04:01.819> I<00:04:02.090> actually<00:04:02.150> go<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.750> crew

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
reasons I actually go to the crew

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.020 
reasons I actually go to the crew
because<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.590> has<00:04:03.769> crazy<00:04:04.099> customisation<00:04:04.819> parts

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
because it has crazy customisation parts

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.220 
because it has crazy customisation parts
and<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.180> can<00:04:05.299> actually<00:04:05.420> make<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.689> car<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.079> way

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
and I can actually make the car the way

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.229 
and I can actually make the car the way
I<00:04:06.260> wanted<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.950> what<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.310> D<00:04:10.489> means<00:04:10.790> maybe<00:04:11.030> it

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
I wanted on what the D means maybe it

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:18.009 
I wanted on what the D means maybe it
means<00:04:11.360> drive<00:04:14.110> don't<00:04:15.110> drive<00:04:16.449> don't<00:04:17.449> come<00:04:17.780> near

it<00:04:47.270> was<00:04:47.360> another<00:04:47.510> Cadillac<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.340> was<00:04:49.460> like

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
it was another Cadillac and I was like

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.430 
it was another Cadillac and I was like
ok<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.270> cool<00:04:50.570> as<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.840> wasn't<00:04:51.139> so<00:04:51.260> well

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
ok this is cool as it wasn't so well

ok this is cool as it wasn't so well
it's<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.650> game<00:04:51.770> it's<00:04:51.979> not<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.310> it's<00:04:52.460> nothing

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
it's a game it's not that it's nothing

it's a game it's not that it's nothing
there<00:04:52.910> now<00:04:53.389> my<00:04:53.570> guess<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:53.990> maybe<00:04:54.260> they're

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
there now my guess is maybe they're

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.870 
there now my guess is maybe they're
gonna<00:04:54.500> add<00:04:54.710> these<00:04:54.830> on<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.400> season<00:04:55.729> pass

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
gonna add these on to the season pass

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.640 
gonna add these on to the season pass
afterwards<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.930> those<00:04:57.050> are<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.229> cars<00:04:57.410> coming

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
afterwards and those are the cars coming

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.260 
afterwards and those are the cars coming
in<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.830> future<00:04:58.190> if<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:58.910> they've<00:04:59.150> already
