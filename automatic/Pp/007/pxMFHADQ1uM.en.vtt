00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.120 
couldn't do but and the quality like I
said<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.660> sharpness<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.380> there<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:37.830> if<00:04:37.979> it's

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
said the sharpness is there so if it's

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.100 
said the sharpness is there so if it's
not<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.310> must-own<00:04:38.789> film<00:04:39.060> don't<00:04:39.300> get<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.690> but

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
not a must-own film don't get it but

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.200 
not a must-own film don't get it but
some<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.130> these<00:04:41.250> films<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.699> I've<00:04:41.880> showed<00:04:42.090> in

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
some of these films that I've showed in

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.820 
some of these films that I've showed in
this<00:04:42.330> video<00:04:42.599> are<00:04:42.780> must-own<00:04:43.169> films<00:04:43.530> which<00:04:43.680> is

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
this video are must-own films which is

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.439 
this video are must-own films which is
why<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:44.010> went<00:04:44.400> ahead<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:44.940> got<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.270> blu-ray

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
why I went ahead and I got the blu-ray

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.589 
why I went ahead and I got the blu-ray
so<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.979> think<00:04:47.190> about<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.580> there<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:47.910> a<00:04:47.940> big<00:04:48.180> big

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
so so think about it there is a big big

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.370 
so so think about it there is a big big
difference<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:49.590> blu-ray<00:04:50.430> vs.<00:04:50.820> DVD<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:51.690> if

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
difference but blu-ray vs. DVD but if

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.110 
difference but blu-ray vs. DVD but if
it's<00:04:52.560> not<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.740> must-own<00:04:53.190> don't<00:04:53.520> get<00:04:53.699> it<00:04:53.820> if<00:04:53.970> it

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
it's not a must-own don't get it if it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.290 
it's not a must-own don't get it if it
is<00:04:54.270> do<00:04:55.050> what<00:04:55.229> I<00:04:55.260> do<00:04:55.460> purchase<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:56.970> enjoy
