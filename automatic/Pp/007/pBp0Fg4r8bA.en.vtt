00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:09.849
 ten centuries will the fortress stand the walls 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.570
 frozen mute and horned lords 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.970
 to bow down to those who are not born yet 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.650
 master of darkness 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.330
 Hello everyone, Milon and I am glad 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.130
 greet you in my next 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.050
 retro review this time I decided 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.580
 think of a rather interesting game under 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.090
 name dark messiah of might and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.880
 magic 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.390
 This game was released in 2006 by developers 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.970
 and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.890
 arkane studios when i ran i then 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.840
 for a long time for some reason there was a feeling that she 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.520
 would be like morrowind or gothic well 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.410
 type your big open world 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.510
 genres then the box did not really understand 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.760
 and on the disc was written fantasy 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.530
 action-adventure shorter here it is only 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.510
 It has not been written in general played 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.550
 literally 10 minutes and I realized that this is not 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.860
 quite what I expected but my 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.480
 Atmosphere game hooked me now 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.610
 I can confidently call you her 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.220
 genre dark messiah of might and magic 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.780
 this is an action with elements of lpg second 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.670
 half the name of the game you can 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.159
 seem interesting that is of might 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.619
 and magic, and not in vain plot dark meat 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.750
 begins in a very dark world just 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.850
 where the action takes place fifth heroes 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 the sword and the magic of prophecy say that 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.439
 I must soon return from oblivion some 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 the dark messiah is hostile to him 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.430
 the main tasks are to do evil and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.170
 plunge the whole world into chaos it is easy to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.850
 guess what we will play for the hero 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.219
 who will fight with everyone 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.380
 unclean our valiant warrior name is 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.389
 Sarov and taught him every magic and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.999
 not just stuff a powerful magician 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:34.039
 Fendrick Sarov knows how to handle all 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.350
 weapons and possess some 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.600
 knowledge of magic but who will it be me 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.369
 I mean a warrior or mage them decide 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.340
 by the actual proper here and 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.600
 These are the elements of the rpg 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.630
 Sarov abilities are divided into 3 groups 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.299
 weapons sword and shield and easter bows 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.880
 possession of magic fireballs lightning 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.490
 telekinesis and other skills like silent 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.709
 steps breaking locks increase hp mana and 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.539
 resistance to poison honestly with 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.759
 the plot of this game has problems 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.529
 it is very difficult to call it original 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.469
 here is the gameplay most likely developers 

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:08.720
 on it and did the main rate in 2003 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.190
 year arkane studios got the engine 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.099
 source and as you probably already understood 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.780
 made this game on it personally to me this 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.470
 engine really like remember 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.000
 half-life 2 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.500
 so give them me say of might and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.480
 magic present interesting 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.580
 gameplay moments for example i am 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 filmed a small fragment look 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.189
 agree that for 2006 looks 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.189
 not bad 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.430
 as I said, the game passes 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.150
 already familiar to us the world 5 heroes in the world 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.299
 entitled 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.769
 Ashan or and tires or Auchan and report and 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.870
 I did not understand how it sounds right 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.819
 word zadroty heroes if something correct 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.069
 me in the comments so here we are 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.840
 where the big world is spread 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.879
 something happens and when in games 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.280
 something new is constantly happening 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.440
 delays here like we just 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.030
 rode peacefully on horseback 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.609
 who came our hero sarif 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.470
 attacked some evil spirits and already 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.430
 the beginning of the game has to be heroic 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.439
 believe me 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.840
 further events will continue approximately 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.000
 in the same way moving along the storyline 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 lines and performing various tasks we 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.689
 We will get experience points that can 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.400
 distribute as you wish 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.409
 with the distribution of points you do not 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.299
 there will be no more difficulties 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.980
 that whatever class is chosen around 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.230
 in the middle of the game these experience points 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.489
 will turn you into a killing machine but 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.290
 In general, I like when the game 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.540
 invites the player to become what he wants 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.859
 and who may not like it 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.540
 there is for example a warrior will be stupid 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.239
 break in and cut off the heads of enemies 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.980
 kick them and so on 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.540
 set fire to or freeze enemies on 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.730
 distance or using telekinesis 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.859
 have fun throwing enemies into barrels and 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.139
 stones can also become silent 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.040
 killer and cut enemies one by one a 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.449
 some tasks 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.579
 where you need to pick up the enemy keys from 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.560
 any doors these keys can 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.720
 be tihorya steal accordingly no 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.760
 with whom I am not at war let's return to 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.069
 source engine dark messiah of might and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.180
 magic not always she will wave her sword and 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.040
 use spells 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.199
 an important point of the game is to use 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.970
 environment and as a weapon again 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.709
 back to the game half-life 2 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.199
 You all probably remembered now how 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.739
 threw bottles at the enemy boxes and other 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.620
 trash 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.570
 Once I play half-life 2 and a half 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.699
 hours out of the starting area, and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.740
 the reason for this is just that it was in the boxes 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.330
 and other items that source engine 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.979
 allows the player to take in hand and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.260
 somewhere or anyone 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.240
 throw in dark meat and this function 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.669
 implemented well in each location 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.770
 can find barrels and boxes worth taking them 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.320
 into the hands and throw the enemy like a poor fellow right away 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.600
 lost 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.490
 c does not understand where and what flew him 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.470
 but arkane studios is not 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.990
 stopped they stuffed locks and 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.670
 dungeons various traps for example 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.220
 you can throw a huge stone at the enemy 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.410
 cut the rope or kick 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.630
 reliance thereby dumping the mountain 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.730
 barrels source engine provided the game 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.590
 decent quality for those years in not 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.570
 great graphics are well drawn 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.130
 characters and both the main and 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.440
 background shadow 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.630
 the animations are all done decent 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.120
 level artists and game designers are clearly 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.310
 tried to play the atmosphere often 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.440
 dark my site and sound are very affected 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.760
 music and other sounds delivers with 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.100
 head immersed in gameplay 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.750
 after launching dark messiah of might and 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.090
 magic you will understand what is your near 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.860
 free a few hours captured in 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.380
 virtual captivity in my humble opinion 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.660
 with baptism developers arpg action 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.910
 this game succeeded you might meet 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.830
 some bugs can even disadvantages 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.270
 by the way one fault I will voice you 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.130
 right now it's small 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.290
 game duration but it all 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.970
 compensated by the benefits of the main of 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.590
 which is it that game i'm real 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.690
 interesting and addictive 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.670
 if for any reason you missed 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.650
 this game is my advice to you to play it 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.870
