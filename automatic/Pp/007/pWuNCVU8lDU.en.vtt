see<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> ports<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:22.220> accessible

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
see that all the ports are accessible

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.980 
see that all the ports are accessible
with<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> side<00:01:26.450> bottom<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> front<00:01:29.040> screen<00:01:29.990> it

really<00:01:31.229> doesn't<00:01:31.680> block<00:01:31.829> anything<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
really doesn't block anything so it's a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.550 
really doesn't block anything so it's a
pretty<00:01:34.320> nice<00:01:34.590> case<00:01:35.750> on<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.930> buns<00:01:37.170> they're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
pretty nice case on you buns they're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.940 
pretty nice case on you buns they're
accessible<00:01:38.869> one<00:01:39.869> thing<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.170> didn't<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.409> was

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
accessible one thing I didn't like was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.870 
accessible one thing I didn't like was
um<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.540> hard<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.430> if

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
um it's pretty hard to take off so if

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.580 
um it's pretty hard to take off so if
you<00:01:45.240> decide<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.960> take<00:01:46.200> off<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:47.280> case<00:01:48.590> might

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you decide to take off this case might

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.149 
you decide to take off this case might
be<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> hard<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.399> probably<00:01:50.759> need<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
be kind of hard you probably need like a

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.410 
be kind of hard you probably need like a
platter<00:01:53.159> object<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> take<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> apart<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> yeah

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
platter object to take it apart so yeah

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.870 
platter object to take it apart so yeah
I<00:01:57.450> wasn't<00:01:57.899> too<00:01:58.710> bad<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.460> wasn't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I wasn't too bad for just wasn't

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
I wasn't too bad for just wasn't
expensive<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:02.189> ship<00:02:03.060> pretty<00:02:03.360> fast<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
expensive and ship pretty fast so it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.100 
expensive and ship pretty fast so it's
all<00:02:04.860> good
