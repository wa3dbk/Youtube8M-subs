00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.090
 Good day to all 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.850
 With you gif I continue a series of reviews 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.360
 ships now it is the turn and the second 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.150
 ship 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.920
 running his mission is easy 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.220
 maneuverable fighter at least i 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.990
 I understand this is the difference between side winder and 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.020
 needles in the initial configuration is small 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.140
 only 16 thousand credits and let's 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.820
 let's see what is behind this price in 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.519
 initial configuration weight of its not 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.809
 more than 84 tons and energy consumption 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.980
 6 megawatts of six and a half 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.750
 available and three to two tons 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.899
 his fuel tank has a 4 ton radius 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.790
 jump 80 big light years what's 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.649
 Unlike the configuration of the cylinder 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.110
 the first three slots are under arms at least everything and 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.149
 first class 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.670
 but only one slot for additional equipment 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.739
 the cost of armor on needles is slightly higher than 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.600
 on the side winder slot under the power 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.030
 installation is also second class which 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.590
 side winder but the slots for engines 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.350
 third class as well as a slot for installation 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.470
 energy distribution class 2 vs. 1 y 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.490
 Site slot under the sensor is the same above 1 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.340
 class 2 class for internal components 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 allocated three slots 3 2 and 1 classes 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.900
 accordingly, and if you remove the shield 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.110
 it is possible in the third class slot 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.930
 put the hold at 8 tons but I do not 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.360
 managed to find a shield and 2 classes that would 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.110
 launched on this ship 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.830
 so flying with smoke at 14 tons is 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.860
 if you put the hold on 8 by 4 by 2 tons 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.670
 versions free slots 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.650
 can only be without shields as you understood in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.780
 hold for 2 units can be put instead 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.960
 scanner but I do not know how much it costs from 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.399
 do after all this same warship and so 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.909
 how did i manage to upgrade it 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.430
 First, I put the hyperdrive in there. 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.990
 level 3 class d it allowed to jump 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.810
 at 26 light years the price confuses it 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.030
 pleasure half a million install same 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.209
 engine level 2 class d 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.970
 over 170 thousand lets jump on 13 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.740
 this bread 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.140
 engines of the third level of class e and d 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.210
 respectively, at a cost of 170,500 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.450
 Thousands of loans give a good increase in 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.780
 maneuverability but speed quite a bit 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.970
 afterburner speed increased to 370 meters 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.990
 second instead 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.990
 340 on standard and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.710
 normal speed is 260 meters per second 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.990
 instead of 240 standard besides for 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.760
 order to put such things you need 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.750
 change the power plant because 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.060
 stock sky pulls maybe no 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.520
 sense to put such expensive parts on 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.730
 this ship because their value 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.730
 now equal to the cost of 2 kopecks but in general 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.370
 circle and fully needle 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.840
 how sweet you can for a couple of millions 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.240
 weapons to put a similar side winder 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.740
 I really did not see the turrets well I think 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.680
 that they simply were not at that moment on 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.070
 stations but a gun one hundred and three slots instead 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.070
 two 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.150
 fighting qualities check you 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.190
 fighter I spent destroying a couple 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.330
 cobras 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.700
 maybe I wouldn't try them 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.110
 against several ships but how 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.020
 small nimble ship and he basically 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.290
 normally coped with a cobra like this 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.270
 was see for yourself i'm ready to accept any 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.060
 valid criticism of my combat 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.240
 skills because I still have them 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.250
 develop I prefer melee I 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.140
 I use machine guns on suspensions in battle 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.110
 why on suspensions because they 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.940
 allow if not enough maneuver to start 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.070
 still shoot a bit earlier when 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.260
 you don't want that ship 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.950
 go to the most convenient for people 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.390
 to maneuver the speed 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.790
 here and forgive a few mistakes on 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.760
 visions although you need to take into account when 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.090
 firing long distance rather 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.670
 just all the cartridges will leave you milk 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.650
 so if you take the weapon to the entrance 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.510
 who is this neighbor if you kill a weapon 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.840
 which requires precise targeting she 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.190
 will beat the apple but you need to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.190
 aim at the target 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.370
 besides what are the advantages of this 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.529
 ship he does not look bad in contrast 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:26.560
 from a cylinder that looks like a little 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:28.120
 rectangles and the ship it looks like 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.840
 how a combat fighter might look like 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.310
 three thousand roads this year in the cabin 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.840
 the truth is cramped mazda of it 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.889
 really amazing 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:45.069
 better than side winder review and not for 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:46.719
 than the wiper summing up where you can 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.669
 would use this ship on my 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.680
 a look first of all is intelligence 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.599
 firstly he is maneuverable secondly he 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.729
 Cheap enough to pay dozens 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.810
 thousands of insurance after the loss of the ship 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.219
 as the case with the ship class above 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.379
 secondly it is possible to have a little 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.669
 to war 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.409
 the storm of the seas of the oceans he may not 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.039
 allow you to become sharpen fighting 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.870
 the skills are quite of the minuses it's small 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.289
 Plume but not putting this ship 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.879
 trade 2 minus in my opinion is 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.839
 quite high cost 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.789
 equipment 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.800
 Well, the maximum that can go there 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.089
 install half a million engine 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.339
 which increases speed by twenty 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:28.360
 meters per second in my opinion it is more 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:30.460
 than much truth to write it in minus 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.969
 can only be with the reservation is a beta version 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.560
 games and center elise on equipment on 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.000
 ship and i don't know maybe not 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.930
 will change to more or less 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.110
 side and then we'll see what 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.930
 worth it and so I finish my 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.710
 review with you was vlad gif all good luck and 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.710
 good flight
