but I just thought I'd help out here you
want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.660> ahead<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> loosen<00:00:43.079> these<00:00:43.469> two

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
want to go ahead and loosen these two

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
want to go ahead and loosen these two
bolts<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.730> you'll<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.690> loosen

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
bolts that are you'll have to loosen

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
bolts that are you'll have to loosen
with<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> Hellen<00:00:46.469> wrench<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.700> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
with the Hellen wrench and what that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.080 
with the Hellen wrench and what that
does<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.050> pinches<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.969> axle<00:00:50.969> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
does is it just pinches the axle in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
does is it just pinches the axle in
place<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> keeps<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> nice<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.440> tight<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
place so it keeps it nice and tight in

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
place so it keeps it nice and tight in
there<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.360> loosen<00:00:54.989> those

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
there but you do have to loosen those

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
there but you do have to loosen those
before<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.180> loosen<00:00:57.180> your<00:00:57.660> axle<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
before you can loosen your axle now the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
before you can loosen your axle now the
other<00:00:59.820> problem<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.300> ran<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.199> axle

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
other problem I ran into is the axle

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.520 
other problem I ran into is the axle
itself<00:01:02.100> has<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> pretty<00:01:03.390> big<00:01:03.600> opening<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
itself has a pretty big opening as you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
itself has a pretty big opening as you
can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.420> didn't<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> tool<00:01:07.020> big

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
can see and I didn't have a tool big

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
can see and I didn't have a tool big
enough<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
enough that would just go in there so I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
enough that would just go in there so I
could<00:01:09.630> loosen<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.380> obviously<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
could loosen it and obviously when it's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.170 
could loosen it and obviously when it's
in<00:01:12.150> place<00:01:12.830> going<00:01:13.830> through<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.220> wheel<00:01:17.180> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in place going through your wheel you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
in place going through your wheel you
can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.320> goes<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.950> through<00:01:19.979> there

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
can see it just goes right through there

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.310 
can see it just goes right through there
through<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> wheel<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.900> course<00:01:22.110> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
through the wheel and of course that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.929 
through the wheel and of course that
tightens<00:01:22.770> down<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> way<00:01:23.460> till<00:01:23.759> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
tightens down all the way till it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.170 
tightens down all the way till it's
flush<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.619> didn't<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.700> anything<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> take

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
flush but I didn't have anything to take

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
flush but I didn't have anything to take
it<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.900> went<00:01:28.110> online<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> there's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

a guy that had shared some information

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
a guy that had shared some information
and<00:01:32.130> said<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.790> take<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> large<00:01:33.270> bolt

and said to just take the large bolt
which<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.049> did<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> head<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.400> was<00:01:38.400> too

end<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.960> could<00:01:55.140> take<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.500> wrench<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
end you could take your wrench and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
end you could take your wrench and
obviously<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.940> loosen<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.000> with

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
obviously you can just loosen it with

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.580 
obviously you can just loosen it with
that<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.730> ended<00:02:02.730> up<00:02:02.850> being<00:02:03.060> pretty<00:02:03.330> simple<00:02:03.870> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that so ended up being pretty simple you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.050 
that so ended up being pretty simple you
want<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> put<00:02:04.980> a<00:02:05.010> couple<00:02:05.280> nuts<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.910> end

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
want to put a couple nuts on the end

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
want to put a couple nuts on the end
like<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:06.810> it'll<00:02:07.100> give<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.429> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like that so it'll give you something to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.690 
like that so it'll give you something to
turn<00:02:09.290> so<00:02:10.290> like<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.950> said<00:02:11.040> just<00:02:11.340> follow<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
turn so like I said just follow that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.730 
turn so like I said just follow that
down<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> makes<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> pretty<00:02:12.600> easy<00:02:12.750> now

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
down that makes it pretty easy now

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.630 
down that makes it pretty easy now
before<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.540> take<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.810> axle<00:02:16.650> completely<00:02:17.430> out

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
before you take the axle completely out

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.810 
before you take the axle completely out
from<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> wheel<00:02:18.800> like<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.890> said<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.370> turns

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
from the wheel like I said it just turns

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.760 
from the wheel like I said it just turns
Esso<00:02:21.690> or<00:02:22.410> such<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.900> before<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
Esso or such and before you do that you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.170 
Esso or such and before you do that you
want<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.130> ahead<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.550> your<00:02:26.700> calipers

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
want to go ahead and get your calipers

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.760 
want to go ahead and get your calipers
out<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.510> way<00:02:27.660> because<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.440> leave<00:02:28.590> your

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
out of the way because if you leave your

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.250 
out of the way because if you leave your
calipers<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.280> place<00:02:30.050> they're<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
calipers in place they're going to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.720 
calipers in place they're going to
scratch<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.709> wheel<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.220> try<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.459> drop

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
scratch your wheel when you try to drop

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.600 
scratch your wheel when you try to drop
that<00:02:32.970> wheel<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.600> you'll<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.530> need<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> loosen

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that wheel so you'll just need to loosen

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.780 
that wheel so you'll just need to loosen
these<00:02:35.880> two<00:02:36.950> there's<00:02:37.950> two<00:02:38.130> bolts<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.490> go<00:02:38.580> in

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
these two there's two bolts that go in

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.690 
these two there's two bolts that go in
there<00:02:38.940> also<00:02:39.180> by<00:02:39.540> allen<00:02:39.959> wrench<00:02:40.430> once<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
there also by allen wrench once you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.640 
there also by allen wrench once you
loosen<00:02:42.120> them<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.630> take<00:02:42.810> them<00:02:42.840> off<00:02:43.140> then<00:02:43.440> your

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
loosen them or take them off then your

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.510 
loosen them or take them off then your
caliper<00:02:44.250> comes<00:02:44.580> right<00:02:44.850> off<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.510> rotor<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
caliper comes right off the rotor and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.650 
caliper comes right off the rotor and
you<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.700> need<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.000> get<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> way

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
you just need to get it out of the way

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.560 
you just need to get it out of the way
so<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.290> did<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.620> put<00:02:49.800> one<00:02:50.570> wrapped

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
so that's what I did I put one wrapped

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.000 
so that's what I did I put one wrapped
it<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.930> shop<00:02:52.140> towel<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.770> put<00:02:52.920> it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
it in the shop towel and just put it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.130 
it in the shop towel and just put it
right<00:02:53.040> there<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.310> top<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.700> my<00:02:53.820> motor<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:55.020> I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
right there on top of my motor and I

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.620 
right there on top of my motor and I
took<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> other<00:02:55.680> one<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.790> placed<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.420> on

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
took the other one and just placed it on

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.590 
took the other one and just placed it on
top<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.800> bench<00:02:59.070> there<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.760> everything's

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
top of the bench there so everything's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.630 
top of the bench there so everything's
still<00:03:00.780> connected<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.320> once<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.800> get<00:03:01.860> my<00:03:02.190> tire

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
still connected so once I get my tire

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
still connected so once I get my tire
put<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.290> get<00:03:04.920> my<00:03:05.070> wheel<00:03:05.250> back<00:03:05.550> on<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
put on and get my wheel back on to the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.979 
put on and get my wheel back on to the
motorcycle<00:03:07.820> then<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.330> just<00:03:09.540> want<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> slip

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
motorcycle then you just want to slip

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.860 
motorcycle then you just want to slip
those<00:03:10.200> calipers<00:03:10.940> right<00:03:11.940> back<00:03:12.150> over<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> rotor

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
those calipers right back over the rotor

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.660 
those calipers right back over the rotor
and<00:03:14.480> tighten<00:03:15.480> them<00:03:15.570> up<00:03:15.720> again<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.489> then<00:03:17.489> you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
and tighten them up again and then you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.840 
and tighten them up again and then you
want<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.970> go<00:03:18.630> ahead<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.250> get<00:03:20.250> your<00:03:20.430> axle

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
want to go ahead and get your axle

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.259 
want to go ahead and get your axle
tightened<00:03:21.209> up<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:22.320> then<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.549> want<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.790> make

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
tightened up and then you want to make

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.890 
tightened up and then you want to make
sure<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.630> tires<00:03:25.310> we<00:03:26.310> rolling<00:03:26.610> freely<00:03:27.030> after

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
sure the tires we rolling freely after

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.199 
sure the tires we rolling freely after
you've<00:03:28.019> done<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.650> then<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.970> want<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
you've done that and then you want to

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.449 
you've done that and then you want to
tighten<00:03:30.870> up<00:03:30.959> these<00:03:31.140> bolts<00:03:31.530> again<00:03:31.650> make<00:03:32.430> sure

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
tighten up these bolts again make sure

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.090 
tighten up these bolts again make sure
all<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.060> tight<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.480> snug<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.049> should<00:03:34.980> be

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
all of it's tight and snug and should be

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.880 
all of it's tight and snug and should be
good<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.260> anyway<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.680> thought<00:03:37.830> that

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
good to go so anyway I just thought that

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.360 
good to go so anyway I just thought that
that<00:03:38.160> might<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.489> some<00:03:38.700> helpful<00:03:39.090> information

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
that might be some helpful information

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.220 
that might be some helpful information
these<00:03:41.370> are<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.730> caliper<00:03:42.570> bolts<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
these are the caliper bolts here and

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.350 
these are the caliper bolts here and
these<00:03:43.980> are<00:03:44.040> just<00:03:44.190> spacers<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.790> went<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
these are just spacers that went on the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.199 
these are just spacers that went on the
ends<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.500> axle<00:03:46.920> or<00:03:47.010> going<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
ends of the axle or going to the to the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.110 
ends of the axle or going to the to the
wheel<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.989> fits<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> axle<00:03:49.769> better<00:03:50.120> so

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
wheel so it fits the axle better so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.390 
wheel so it fits the axle better so
anyway<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.890> all<00:03:52.890> you're<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.250> really

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
anyway just all you're going to really
