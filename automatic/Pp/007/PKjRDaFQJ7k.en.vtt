00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.990 

we<00:00:09.510> took<00:00:09.690> one<00:00:10.019> straight<00:00:10.559> look<00:00:10.830> very<00:00:11.160> shiny<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
we took one straight look very shiny and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.960 
we took one straight look very shiny and
flat<00:00:12.420> into<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> an<00:00:14.160> updo<00:00:14.839> with<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.199> few<00:00:16.529> tips

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
flat into a an updo with a very few tips

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.279 
flat into a an updo with a very few tips
so<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.090> start<00:00:18.330> preparing<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> look<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so we start preparing the look with a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.590 
so we start preparing the look with a
high<00:00:19.560> horseshoe<00:00:20.189> section<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.850> then<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> lower

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
high horseshoe section and then a lower

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.990 
high horseshoe section and then a lower
radial<00:00:22.050> parting<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:23.519> panels

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
radial parting so we have two panels

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359 
radial parting so we have two panels
through<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> sides<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:25.470> isolate<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.189> top

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
through the sides we isolate the top

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.220 
through the sides we isolate the top
area<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.330> start<00:00:27.630> working<00:00:28.050> through

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
area and then we start working through

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.700 
area and then we start working through
the<00:00:28.349> back

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.530 

so<00:00:36.710> how<00:00:36.890> we<00:00:36.950> start<00:00:37.370> using<00:00:37.550> we're<00:00:38.000> using<00:00:38.180> the

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
so how we start using we're using the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.590 
so how we start using we're using the
work<00:00:39.200> it's<00:00:39.470> hairspray<00:00:40.040> from<00:00:40.700> session<00:00:41.120> series

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
work it's hairspray from session series

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.130 
work it's hairspray from session series
the<00:00:42.079> reason<00:00:42.410> why<00:00:42.530> we<00:00:42.770> use<00:00:42.800> work<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.610> because

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
the reason why we use work it is because

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500 
the reason why we use work it is because
it's<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.260> very<00:00:45.530> dry<00:00:46.160> hairspray

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's a very dry hairspray

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.650 
it's a very dry hairspray
it's<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:48.440> has<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.590> level<00:00:49.010> or<00:00:49.100> two<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.550> holding<00:00:50.000> so

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's it has a level or two of holding so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.720 
it's it has a level or two of holding so
as<00:00:50.960> well<00:00:51.170> as<00:00:51.290> being<00:00:51.500> dry<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:52.129> has<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.309> little<00:00:52.670> bit

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
as well as being dry it has a little bit

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:27.100 
as well as being dry it has a little bit
of<00:00:52.850> hold

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.620 

using<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> work<00:01:28.800> it's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.310> spray<00:01:29.909> spray<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
using the work it's a spray spray a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.540 
using the work it's a spray spray a
little<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> time<00:01:31.229> let<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.830> product<00:01:32.190> dry

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
little bit at a time let the product dry

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.030 
little bit at a time let the product dry
into<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.270> section<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.470> brush<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.009> through

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
into the section then brush it through

00:01:35.040 --> 00:02:44.420 
into the section then brush it through
just<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.149> much<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.690> slick

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
