falling<00:02:12.600> into<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:12.990> cream<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.860> don't<00:02:14.130> love

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
falling into my cream so I don't love

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.490 
falling into my cream so I don't love
but<00:02:14.790> at<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> same<00:02:15.360> time<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.660> don't<00:02:15.810> find<00:02:16.230> either

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
but at the same time I don't find either

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.130 
but at the same time I don't find either
of<00:02:16.710> these<00:02:16.800> powders<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.670> overly<00:02:18.390> flaky<00:02:18.900> like

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
of these powders to be overly flaky like

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
of these powders to be overly flaky like
when<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.320> put<00:02:19.590> my<00:02:19.620> brush<00:02:20.010> into<00:02:20.520> them<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.940> don't

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
when I put my brush into them I don't

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.120 
when I put my brush into them I don't
feel<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:21.960> they're<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.470> busting<00:02:22.980> out

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
feel like they're really busting out

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.400 
feel like they're really busting out
everywhere<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.510> some<00:02:24.840> kicking<00:02:25.200> up

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
everywhere you know like some kicking up

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.040 
everywhere you know like some kicking up
a<00:02:25.500> lot<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.860> powders<00:02:26.250> when<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.640> am<00:02:26.910> dabbing<00:02:27.570> into

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
a lot of powders when I am dabbing into

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
a lot of powders when I am dabbing into
one<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> these<00:02:28.350> shades<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:28.890> literally<00:02:29.340> just

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
one of these shades I'm literally just

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.980 
one of these shades I'm literally just
kind<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.790> dabbing<00:02:30.210> into<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.630> because<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
kind of dabbing into it because it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990 
kind of dabbing into it because it
doesn't<00:02:31.350> take<00:02:31.500> much<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.980> product<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
doesn't take much of the product so I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.060 
doesn't take much of the product so I
feel<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:34.020> keep<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.350> issue<00:02:34.620> under

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
feel like I can keep that issue under

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.600 
feel like I can keep that issue under
control<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.630> combined<00:02:37.610> nature

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
control but I like the combined nature

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.550 
control but I like the combined nature
of<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.910> palette<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:39.690> anytime<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.230> take

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
of this palette because anytime you take

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800 
of this palette because anytime you take
you<00:02:40.800> know<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.920> cream<00:02:41.370> blush<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.600> add

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
you know a cream blush and then you add

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.630 
you know a cream blush and then you add
a<00:02:42.840> little<00:02:43.230> bit<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.410> powder<00:02:43.620> over<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.100> top<00:02:44.220> I

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
a little bit of powder over the top I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.300 
a little bit of powder over the top I
think<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.360> duo<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.500> lock<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
think that duo like they lock it and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.180 
think that duo like they lock it and
you've<00:02:47.430> got<00:02:47.459> really<00:02:47.970> good<00:02:48.510> staying<00:02:48.870> power<00:02:49.200> as

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
you've got really good staying power as

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.770 
you've got really good staying power as
opposed<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.670> just<00:02:50.910> wearing<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> other

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
opposed to just wearing one or the other

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
opposed to just wearing one or the other
aligned<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.830> quality<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.310> this

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
aligned you like the quality of this

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.060 
aligned you like the quality of this
cream<00:02:53.700> blush<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.270> only<00:02:54.480> takes<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.080> tiny<00:02:55.470> bit<00:02:55.890> I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
cream blush it only takes a tiny bit I

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.130 
cream blush it only takes a tiny bit I
used<00:02:56.100> my<00:02:56.490> ELF<00:02:56.700> small<00:02:57.090> stipple<00:02:57.510> brush<00:02:57.540> tapped

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
used my ELF small stipple brush tapped

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.860 
used my ELF small stipple brush tapped
into<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.770> just<00:02:59.370> stippled<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.000> onto<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.570> cheeks

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
into it just stippled it onto my cheeks

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.900 
into it just stippled it onto my cheeks
and<00:03:01.110> then<00:03:01.230> kind<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.440> blended<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.459> found

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and then kind of blended it out I found

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.790 
and then kind of blended it out I found
it<00:03:03.030> pretty<00:03:03.270> easy<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.750> blend<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.470> wouldn't

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
it pretty easy to blend out I wouldn't

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.130 
it pretty easy to blend out I wouldn't
say<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.160> maybe<00:03:05.340> as<00:03:05.580> easy<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.209> blend<00:03:06.600> as<00:03:06.840> one

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
say it's maybe as easy to blend as one

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.100 
say it's maybe as easy to blend as one
of<00:03:07.290> those<00:03:07.610> Maybelline<00:03:08.610> master<00:03:08.910> glaze<00:03:09.390> sticks

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
of those Maybelline master glaze sticks

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.800 
of those Maybelline master glaze sticks
but<00:03:10.770> it's<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.520> not<00:03:11.730> difficult<00:03:12.030> I'll<00:03:12.510> put<00:03:12.690> it

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
but it's it's not difficult I'll put it

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.080 
but it's it's not difficult I'll put it
that<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.170> doesn't<00:03:13.530> remain<00:03:13.769> tacky<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.550> doesn't

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
that it doesn't remain tacky it doesn't

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.729 
that it doesn't remain tacky it doesn't
have<00:03:15.239> some<00:03:15.420> kind<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.720> weird<00:03:15.900> texture<00:03:16.410> thing

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
have some kind of a weird texture thing

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.070 
have some kind of a weird texture thing
going<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> think<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.209> performs<00:03:18.600> nicely

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
going on so I think it performs nicely

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.050 
going on so I think it performs nicely
pretty<00:03:19.230> much<00:03:19.440> any<00:03:19.620> time<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.890> use<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.670> tend

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
pretty much any time I use this I tend

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.880 
pretty much any time I use this I tend
to<00:03:21.239> either<00:03:21.930> use<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.790> powder<00:03:23.970> blushes<00:03:24.450> or
