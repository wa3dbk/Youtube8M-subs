00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
so these trays actually come with the

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.040 
so these trays actually come with the
oven<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:34.420> want<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.600> do<00:00:34.690> first<00:00:34.840> of<00:00:35.020> all

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
helps the actual fish not stick to the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.470 
helps the actual fish not stick to the
steamer<00:00:39.280> tray<00:00:39.550> when<00:00:39.699> we<00:00:39.790> put<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.059> inside<00:00:40.300> the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.750 
actually located down the bottom and
then<00:01:32.770> above<00:01:33.010> that<00:01:33.220> I'm<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.490> put<00:01:33.640> my

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
then above that I'm going to put my

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.550 
then above that I'm going to put my
vegetables<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:35.620> third<00:01:35.830> shelf<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:37.560> now

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
vegetables on the third shelf and now

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.820 
vegetables on the third shelf and now
we're<00:01:38.740> done

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.560 

so<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> next<00:01:44.130> step<00:01:44.370> is<00:01:44.730> I<00:01:44.910> approach<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> oven

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so the next step is I approach the oven

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.900 
so the next step is I approach the oven
all<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.050> do<00:01:46.230> on<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> particular<00:01:47.370> oven

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
all I have to do on this particular oven

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.970 
all I have to do on this particular oven
just<00:01:48.030> rotate<00:01:48.480> around<00:01:48.600> I've<00:01:49.080> got<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> hundred

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
just rotate around I've got a hundred

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.830 
just rotate around I've got a hundred
percent<00:01:50.130> steam<00:01:50.670> selected<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.630> full

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
percent steam selected so it's the full

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.720 
percent steam selected so it's the full
capacity<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.040> product<00:01:53.340> form<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> standing

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
capacity of the product form a standing

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.580 
capacity of the product form a standing
point-of-view<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> choose<00:01:55.410> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
point-of-view and all I do is choose the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.470 
point-of-view and all I do is choose the
temperature<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.790> 100<00:01:57.240> degrees

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
temperature which is a 100 degrees

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.910 
temperature which is a 100 degrees
Celsius<00:01:57.930> which<00:01:58.110> obviously<00:01:58.350> replicates

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
Celsius which obviously replicates

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.040 
Celsius which obviously replicates
boiling<00:01:59.310> water<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.180> my<00:02:00.330> steamer<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:00.870> on

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
boiling water so now my steamer is on

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.890 
boiling water so now my steamer is on
and<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.890> 12<00:02:02.340> minutes<00:02:02.580> my<00:02:02.880> fish<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> my

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
and in about 12 minutes my fish and my

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.780 
and in about 12 minutes my fish and my
vegetables<00:02:04.440> will<00:02:04.830> be<00:02:04.950> absolutely<00:02:05.520> perfect

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
vegetables will be absolutely perfect

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900 
vegetables will be absolutely perfect
I'll<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> no<00:02:06.660> flavor<00:02:06.900> transfer<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
I'll have no flavor transfer and the the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
I'll have no flavor transfer and the the
great<00:02:09.119> thing<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.540> steamer<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.380> I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
great thing about a steamer is if if I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.230 
great thing about a steamer is if if I
happen<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> forget<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> product<00:02:12.150> was

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
happen to forget this product was

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.810 
happen to forget this product was
cooking<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.410> went<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> bit<00:02:13.709> longer<00:02:14.040> what

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
cooking and I went a bit longer what

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.100 
cooking and I went a bit longer what
we'll<00:02:14.970> find<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> steamer

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
we'll find here is that the steamer

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.110 
we'll find here is that the steamer
being<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.440> very<00:02:16.680> gentle<00:02:17.250> style<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.730> cooking

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
being a very gentle style of cooking

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.090 
being a very gentle style of cooking
will<00:02:18.510> actually<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.080> overcook<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
will actually not overcook the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.920 
will actually not overcook the
vegetables<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> fish<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.420> I've<00:02:21.750> got<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
vegetables or the fish and I've got a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.630 
vegetables or the fish and I've got a
good<00:02:22.200> 5<00:02:22.500> minutes<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.980> Tolerance<00:02:23.430> they're

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
good 5 minutes of Tolerance they're

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.370 
good 5 minutes of Tolerance they're
obvious<00:02:24.239> if<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.420> left<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.050> half<00:02:25.230> an

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
obvious if I left it in here for half an

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.960 
obvious if I left it in here for half an
hour<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.590> would<00:02:25.680> ruin<00:02:25.890> things<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.790> certainly

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
hour it would ruin things but certainly

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180 
hour it would ruin things but certainly
five<00:02:27.420> minutes<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:27.959> more<00:02:28.170> over<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.830> prepared

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
five minutes or more over the prepared

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.220 
five minutes or more over the prepared
time<00:02:29.489> which<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:29.970> 12<00:02:30.360> minutes<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:31.020> going

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
time which is about 12 minutes is going

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.860 
time which is about 12 minutes is going
to<00:02:31.290> give<00:02:31.440> me<00:02:31.620> plenty<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> tolerance<00:02:33.239> not<00:02:33.750> to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
to give me plenty of tolerance not to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.630 
to give me plenty of tolerance not to
have<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.110> sit<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.560> literally<00:02:35.310> watch

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
have to sit here and literally watch

my fish and my vegetables are in and in

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.000 
my fish and my vegetables are in and in
about<00:02:39.870> 12<00:02:40.140> minutes<00:02:40.290> time<00:02:40.560> we'll<00:02:40.709> come<00:02:40.860> back

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
about 12 minutes time we'll come back

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.360 
about 12 minutes time we'll come back
and<00:02:41.130> see<00:02:41.280> how<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.640> went

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.500 

okay<00:02:47.370> we're<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.640> here<00:02:47.820> with<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> steamer<00:02:48.360> so

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
okay we're back here with the steamer so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.820 
okay we're back here with the steamer so
we've<00:02:48.630> actually<00:02:48.750> been<00:02:49.020> running<00:02:49.140> there<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.560> 12

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
we've actually been running there for 12

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.500 
we've actually been running there for 12
minutes<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> heat<00:02:50.910> up<00:02:50.940> time<00:02:51.300> that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
minutes so we got to heat up time that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.000 
minutes so we got to heat up time that
we<00:02:51.570> use<00:02:51.780> an<00:02:51.930> assumed<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.410> brings<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
we use an assumed that brings it to the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.230 
we use an assumed that brings it to the
full<00:02:53.280> temperature<00:02:53.670> which<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> hundred

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
full temperature which is a hundred

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120 
full temperature which is a hundred
percent<00:02:54.390> humidity<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.140> 100<00:02:55.800> percent

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
percent humidity and 100 percent

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.730 
percent humidity and 100 percent
temperature<00:02:56.610> 100<00:02:57.480> degrees<00:02:57.720> Celsius<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.590> we've

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
temperature 100 degrees Celsius so we've

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.460 
temperature 100 degrees Celsius so we've
got<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.940> the<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.660> fish<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.080> we've<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
got the the the fish and we've got the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.540 
got the the the fish and we've got the
vegetables<00:03:01.650> which<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.070> been<00:03:02.220> inside<00:03:02.490> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
vegetables which have been inside the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.800 
vegetables which have been inside the
steamer<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.060> we're<00:03:03.150> gonna<00:03:03.270> grab<00:03:03.450> those<00:03:03.570> out

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
steamer so we're gonna grab those out

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.680 
steamer so we're gonna grab those out
now<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.760> top<00:03:05.970> shelf<00:03:06.180> we've<00:03:06.390> got<00:03:06.540> our
