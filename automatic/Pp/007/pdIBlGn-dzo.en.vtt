00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.729
 hi empire indiciados 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.480
 Well, I am going to teach you a very important tutorial for you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.690
 is about how to make a victory and a day and move for your adventure 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.599
 first of all we open the editor and we are going to make a new adventure 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.189
 we create a unit that is our hero of adventure 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.640
 we put a name of the writer characters for example I put archer 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 I'm going to create an example conversation 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.500
 the text for example I put poor of you that make me die 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
 we create a sequence and with emotion 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.780
 I put the code of the conversation 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 so that it starts with a conversation the game 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.580
 now it is not a matter of following the sequence but creating another sequence for 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 do a good move if the unit dies 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.070
 and the code so that if the unit dies and the game runs out with a day and move 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 is that code 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.420
 here we have to put the writer's name the unit that if he dies he 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.900
 finish the game 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.560
 like that one here that we have previously put archer of name of writings 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.529
 from here we put the text you want to leave if you lose the game 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.670
 we have left everything in a different sequence compiled and tested 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.949
 begins the conversation that says copper situ if you make me die 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:34.009
 if we make it die we can test if the window of the end of the game 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.229
 Now if you allow me to put a very secret code to die 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.009
 any unit selected 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.009
 we have died the unit and the end window of the game comes out 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.659
 the code has worked and we already know what to do to finish the game if it dies 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.679
 a unit 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.869
 we already know how to finish the lost game now how to make a game victory 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.059
 now we have to make a new sequence 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.979
 in the same script sequence at the end of all source codes 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.079
 at the end of all we have to put the following code 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:21.059
 now because it is not complete but when the conversation is over it will come out 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.459
 the window of victory 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.169
 here we put the text you want to come out if you finish the game with a 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.169
 victory 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.689
 now in this adventure if the goalkeeper juan escutia and modern but if he follows the 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.679
 script you finish the game well 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.819
 in this case just finishing the conversation according to the script win the 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.239
 departure 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
 and try 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.789
 the conversation comes out 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.199
 And the more I won the game, I know it's another 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.489
 but it's a test to know if it comes out 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.899
 that code must always be put at the end of your complete adventure 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.029
 we already know how to lose and win games and the tutorial is over 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.509
 little difficult but it is very useful important when you make your own 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.489
 adventure 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.540
 to finish the lost game you have to put a sequence for each unit that 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.110
 you want it to be important and for victory you have to fill in the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.469
 end of the game script sequence 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.460
 I hope I have served you and goodbye
