microscope<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.360> real<00:01:54.630> pretty

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
microscope and it was not real pretty

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.980 
microscope and it was not real pretty
and<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.600> we<00:01:57.600> gave<00:01:58.049> him<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.350> product<00:01:59.570> we<00:02:00.570> gave<00:02:00.750> him

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and so we gave him a product we gave him

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
and so we gave him a product we gave him
a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.659> little<00:02:03.750> bit

the slide put it under the microscope it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.430 
the slide put it under the microscope it
looked<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.370> picture<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.970> right
