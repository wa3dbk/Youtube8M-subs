then I can not apply or I can apply a

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.110 
then I can not apply or I can apply a
different<00:03:48.420> layouts<00:03:48.930> there<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.790> then

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
different layouts there and and then

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.940 
different layouts there and and then
just<00:03:51.540> bring<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.020> graphics<00:03:52.530> from<00:03:52.740> that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
just bring in the graphics from that

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.600 
just bring in the graphics from that
slide<00:03:53.280> master<00:03:53.760> into<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.240> single<00:03:54.870> style<00:03:55.610> but

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.780 
come to the first slide that i have a
couple<00:04:07.320> different<00:04:07.530> options<00:04:07.830> as<00:04:08.220> well<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.700> you

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790

can see in the bottom in the back here i
have<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.820> rectangle<00:04:12.480> now<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:12.990> rectangle

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
have this rectangle now the rectangle

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.750 
have this rectangle now the rectangle
has<00:04:13.830> kind<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.880> pattern<00:04:15.420> or<00:04:15.630> shape<00:04:16.049> there<00:04:16.380> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
has kind of a pattern or shape there and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.880 
has kind of a pattern or shape there and
this<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:18.030> an<00:04:18.540> image<00:04:18.840> that's<00:04:19.020> brought<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.680> that

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
this is an image that's brought in that

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.259 
this is an image that's brought in that
you<00:04:20.040> can<00:04:20.220> format<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:20.880> can

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
you can format and you can

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.260 
you can format and you can
actually<00:04:22.049> no<00:04:22.199> it's<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.620> sorry<00:04:23.520> yeah<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.970> feel

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
actually no it's a sorry yeah the feel

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.990 
actually no it's a sorry yeah the feel
is<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.660> texture<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.520> texture<00:04:26.970> was

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
is a texture and so the texture was

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.540 
is a texture and so the texture was
brought<00:04:27.389> in<00:04:27.629> and<00:04:28.560> changed<00:04:29.099> a<00:04:29.190> little<00:04:29.310> bits

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
brought in and changed a little bits

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.020 
brought in and changed a little bits
transparency<00:04:30.419> set<00:04:30.659> at<00:04:30.780> ninety-six<00:04:31.319> percent

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
transparency set at ninety-six percent

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.180 
transparency set at ninety-six percent
and<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.389> can<00:04:33.810> modify<00:04:34.229> that<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:34.949> then<00:04:35.069> you

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
and so you can modify that but then you

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.760 
and so you can modify that but then you
can<00:04:35.340> also<00:04:35.490> modify<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.210> other<00:04:36.629> square<00:04:37.080> now

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
can also modify this other square now

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.550 
can also modify this other square now
this<00:04:37.919> other<00:04:38.159> square<00:04:38.639> is<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.199> gradients<00:04:40.199> color

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
this other square is the gradients color

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.619 
this other square is the gradients color
that's<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.009> the<00:04:41.129> background<00:04:41.669> now<00:04:42.270> because<00:04:42.599> a

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
that's in the background now because a

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.930 
that's in the background now because a
month<00:04:42.900> slide<00:04:43.229> one<00:04:43.590> anything<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.310> do<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.819> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
month slide one anything I do to the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.149 
month slide one anything I do to the
background<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.780> actually<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.379> to<00:04:46.560> cascade

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
background is actually going to cascade

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.640 
background is actually going to cascade
until<00:04:47.520> all<00:04:47.699> of<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:48.090> other<00:04:48.270> slides<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.470> the

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
until all of the other slides so the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.110 
until all of the other slides so the
color<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.340> background<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:51.000> everything

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
color and the background and everything

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.080 
color and the background and everything
that's<00:04:51.569> using<00:04:52.169> this<00:04:52.319> slide<00:04:52.620> master<00:04:53.099> is<00:04:53.280> going

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
that's using this slide master is going

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.659 
that's using this slide master is going
to<00:04:54.240> show<00:04:54.539> or<00:04:54.900> is<00:04:55.409> going<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.800> have<00:04:56.039> this<00:04:56.280> effect

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
to show or is going to have this effect

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.370 
to show or is going to have this effect
and<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.060> if<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.330> wanted<00:04:57.599> to<00:04:57.659> change<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:58.050> color

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
and so if I wanted to change the color

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.320 
and so if I wanted to change the color
of<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.680> background<00:04:58.860> let's<00:04:59.789> go<00:05:00.000> ahead<00:05:00.180> and

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
of the background let's go ahead and

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.529 
of the background let's go ahead and
change<00:05:00.509> this<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:01.139> read<00:05:01.620> for<00:05:01.860> example<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.610> I'm

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
change this to read for example and I'm

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.260 
change this to read for example and I'm
going<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.870> align<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.800> back<00:05:05.069> to<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.340> stage<00:05:05.759> so

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
going to align this back to the stage so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.640 
going to align this back to the stage so
I'm<00:05:06.360> going<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.539> line<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.960> center<00:05:07.470> and

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
I'm going to line that the center and

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.770 
I'm going to line that the center and
I'm<00:05:08.220> going<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.580> align<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.300> middle<00:05:09.630> as

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
I'm going to align it to the middle as

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.899 
I'm going to align it to the middle as
well<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.319> then<00:05:10.919> we're<00:05:11.190> going<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.430> do<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.699> same

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
well and then we're going to do the same

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.670 
well and then we're going to do the same
thing<00:05:12.120> with<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.270> texture<00:05:12.810> so<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> line<00:05:13.440> to

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
thing with the texture so a line to

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.700 
thing with the texture so a line to
Center<00:05:14.039> and<00:05:14.270> align<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.509> middle<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:16.319> I<00:05:16.349> have<00:05:16.560> it

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
Center and align to middle so I have it

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.369 
Center and align to middle so I have it
directly<00:05:17.099> in<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.460> middle<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.169> again<00:05:19.169> you'll
