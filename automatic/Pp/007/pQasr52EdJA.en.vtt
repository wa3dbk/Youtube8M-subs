00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.169
 [Music] 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.480
 will be in the air mediafire with a link that 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:38.280
 I put on mediafire so it will be a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.000
 principle of supervisors 3.0.7 file 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 well because it must be so should the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 so download me as I have a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.300
 file explorer is asking me so 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.480
 wanted to download then you go in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.269
 your file explorer me 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.190
 I try explorers you go in 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.500
 download from your phone 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 so give it to the vote on the phone the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.739
 hall as I already downloaded a aÃ¯ 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.769
 once he downloaded a second 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.810
 times deletes it so you do to then 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.640
 we make you copy you go on the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.009
 root of your phone not your 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 SD card from your phone by the way 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:18.990
 so stick me me guys but you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.250
 sticks and removes 1 that's it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.729
 on the phone 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.200
 after copying pasted on the root of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.789
 your phone you should just 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.599
 turn off your phone and get 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.899
 found immediately for the second 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.250
 part 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.649
 so here you have turned off your 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.319
 android and after that it will have to put 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.119
 your android in recovery mode so no 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.179
 do that you will need to support 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.640
 on the power home button and volume + 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.429
 simultaneously for about four 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.080
 seconds and the guardian forced until 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.539
 that when the screen appears you 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.849
 count to 2 seconds and you 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.950
 release everything so he's not going to turn on 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.580
 enormously he's going to put the phone in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.060
 mode of recovery so you will have to manipulate 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.610
 the slider with volume + and - and you 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.300
 have to go in a hip hop style sd 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.720
 map went into this infernal cauldron 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.220
 SD card so normally 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.720
 like me I am also a fashionable object 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 it's not like everyone else but 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.110
 you find until you have all the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.360
 your phone's folders 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.470
 both enormously the file that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.470
 you put at the root of your 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.990
 phone lies lies while 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.700
 bottom of all these folders so you the 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.490
 choose you press the button 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.170
 home power you choose it there will be 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.650
 a mini load is really not 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.800
 very long and you do go back and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.170
 reboot does not normally have the file 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.620
 no we after you have click 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.480
 enormously he has a plaid or 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.800
 complete but not hero 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.770
 normally if you missed 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.930
 abbas errors but usually that would be 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.700
 so not normally everything has to go well 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.310
 move on and then you have that to do the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.820
 full and you will check if their 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.820
 high works well 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.180
 so here is after you is realized to 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.740
 step number 1 and 2 you have super 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.569
 users who will appear in your menu 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.250
 of applications and to be sure that you 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.080
 are road and download listening shaker 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.750
 on the place because sometimes I'm 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.860
 not a goat will download but you 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 can not use all 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.440
 applications you press 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.630
 check gross access is normally 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.950
 you have a message at sea so here you go 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.720
 that's all for today 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.050
 I wanted to show how to taste all 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.220
 the android through a supervisor so 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.319
 do not forget to apply and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.670
 comment subscribe to be known 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.670
