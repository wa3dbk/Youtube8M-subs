00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
not get ahead of ourselves I think it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.340 
not get ahead of ourselves I think it
just<00:00:39.510> comes<00:00:39.750> down<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.170> getting

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
just comes down to not getting

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.049 
just comes down to not getting
complacent<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> win<00:00:41.850> games

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
complacent because when you win games

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.400 
complacent because when you win games
obviously<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.540> feels<00:00:42.690> good<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.200> look<00:00:43.320> at

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
obviously it feels good you can look at

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
obviously it feels good you can look at
what<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> did<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.879> pretty<00:00:45.120> easy

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
what you did right but it's pretty easy

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
what you did right but it's pretty easy
to<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.200> over<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> replay<00:00:46.770> where<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> win

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to just go over a replay where you win

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.139 
to just go over a replay where you win
and<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.550> look<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> good

and just like look at all the good
things<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.899> could<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.170> back

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
things so you do like I could go back

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
things so you do like I could go back
watch<00:00:49.980> me<00:00:50.129> kill<00:00:50.309> try<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.730> oh<00:00:50.910> yeah<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.180> so

good<00:00:51.539> at<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> game<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.379> reality<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:52.980> should

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
good at the game but a reality we should

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.869 
good at the game but a reality we should
be<00:00:53.160> looking<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> things<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.760> need<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
be looking at the things we need to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
be looking at the things we need to
improve<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.600> no<00:00:54.629> matter<00:00:54.960> how<00:00:55.170> well

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
improve on because no matter how well

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
improve on because no matter how well
you<00:00:55.620> play<00:00:55.920> there's<00:00:56.129> always<00:00:56.460> stuff<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.850> be

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you play there's always stuff you can be

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.099 
you play there's always stuff you can be
doing<00:00:57.000> better<00:00:57.120> maybe<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.570> could<00:00:57.750> award<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
doing better maybe we could award it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
doing better maybe we could award it
better<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.980> could<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.489> someplace<00:00:59.699> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
better we could there someplace you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
better we could there someplace you
missed<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:01.230> stuff<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
missed out on just stuff like that so I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
missed out on just stuff like that so I
think<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.579> always<00:01:02.850> looking<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
think it's just about always looking to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.750 
think it's just about always looking to
improve<00:01:03.390> instead<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.710> trying<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> think

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
improve instead of just trying to think

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
improve instead of just trying to think
you're<00:01:05.970> good<00:01:06.119> hi<00:01:07.049> you've<00:01:07.409> always<00:01:07.650> been<00:01:07.770> very

looking<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.180> individually<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.530> improve<00:01:25.890> upon

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
looking to individually to improve upon

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
looking to individually to improve upon
as<00:01:26.490> media<00:01:27.119> said<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.110> victories

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
as media said out of these victories

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340 
as media said out of these victories
well<00:01:29.520> even<00:01:30.509> though<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.780> win<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.229> still

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
well even though we win there's still

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
well even though we win there's still
things<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.799> done<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.220> an<00:01:32.460> example<00:01:32.820> when

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
things we have done as an example when

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
things we have done as an example when
they<00:01:33.420> did<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> three-man<00:01:34.170> gank<00:01:34.470> im<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> tap<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
they did the three-man gank im a tap and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
they did the three-man gank im a tap and
we<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:35.640> balls<00:01:35.909> teleport<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.659> could<00:01:36.900> have

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we had balls teleport in I could have

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.420 
we had balls teleport in I could have
told<00:01:37.079> him<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> cancel<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> TP<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.340> would

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
told him to cancel the TP so we would

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
told him to cancel the TP so we would
still<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.820> shorter<00:01:39.299> cooldown<00:01:39.450> he<00:01:39.990> looks

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
still have a shorter cooldown he looks

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.300 
still have a shorter cooldown he looks
like<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.350> minor<00:01:40.650> thing<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.040> something<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
like a minor thing that's something that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670 
like a minor thing that's something that
we<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.700> done<00:01:41.790> better<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:43.200> media

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
we could have done better and as media

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.780 
we could have done better and as media
said<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.220> always<00:01:44.369> things<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
said there are always things that you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
said there are always things that you
can<00:01:44.909> always<00:01:45.119> work<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.689> improve<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> i

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
can always work on to improve on and i

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
can always work on to improve on and i
had<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> hundred<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:47.820> team<00:01:48.060> stephs<00:01:48.450> like

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
had a hundred of our team stephs like

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.590 
had a hundred of our team stephs like
him<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.610> maybe<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.939> don't<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.240> I'd<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.479> cool

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
him so maybe if I don't that I'd be cool

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
him so maybe if I don't that I'd be cool

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
coming with a purpose right that was

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.260 
coming with a purpose right that was
something<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.280> jad<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:56.820> spoke<00:01:57.060> about

something that jad actually spoke about

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
something that jad actually spoke about
earlier<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.649> show<00:01:58.680> today<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.610> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
earlier in the show today was that you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.100 
earlier in the show today was that you

you<00:02:03.210> know<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> grander<00:02:03.869> scheme<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.200> things

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
you know the grander scheme of things

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
you know the grander scheme of things
achieving<00:02:04.860> something<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.180> look<00:02:06.329> at

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
achieving something but when we look at

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
achieving something but when we look at
games<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.960> where<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.409> guys<00:02:07.619> had<00:02:07.950> such

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
games like this where you guys had such

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.889 
games like this where you guys had such
an<00:02:08.700> early<00:02:09.060> lead<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
an early lead and you do this

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.979 
an early lead and you do this
consistently<00:02:10.410> right<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.430> 20<00:02:12.180> minutes<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
consistently right at 20 minutes in you

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
consistently right at 20 minutes in you
had<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.349> killed<00:02:13.590> as

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
had one killed as

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
had one killed as
he<00:02:14.250> had<00:02:14.400> three<00:02:14.730> two<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.240> turrets<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.990> had

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
he had three two one turrets you had

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.290 
he had three two one turrets you had
five<00:02:16.320> K<00:02:16.560> gold<00:02:16.770> lead<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.580> were<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.180> one

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
five K gold lead and you were one in one

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.660 
five K gold lead and you were one in one
in<00:02:18.330> dragons<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.380> gold<00:02:19.650> disparity<00:02:20.220> kill

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
in dragons that's a gold disparity kill

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.250 
in dragons that's a gold disparity kill
disparity<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.240> dragon<00:02:21.450> differential<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
disparity and a dragon differential that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.160 
disparity and a dragon differential that
like<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.800> very<00:02:23.160> rarely<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:24.050> what<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
like we very rarely see what do you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.870 
like we very rarely see what do you
attribute<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:26.070> your<00:02:26.370> team<00:02:26.610> because

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
attribute that to on your team because

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.930 
attribute that to on your team because
you<00:02:26.970> guys<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.450> week<00:02:27.930> day<00:02:28.140> after<00:02:28.410> day<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you guys do it week day after day I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.790 
you guys do it week day after day I
think<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.300> as<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> team<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.930> played<00:02:31.050> very<00:02:31.320> well

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
think we as a team just played very well

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.200 
think we as a team just played very well
that<00:02:32.010> game<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.400> most<00:02:32.580> part<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:32.910> played

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
that game for the most part we played

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.910 
that game for the most part we played
very<00:02:33.240> safe<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:33.930> had<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> lot<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.350> vision<00:02:34.710> up<00:02:34.800> so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
very safe we had a lot of vision up so

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.050 
very safe we had a lot of vision up so
we<00:02:34.980> could<00:02:35.070> always<00:02:35.370> see<00:02:35.490> what<00:02:35.520> they're<00:02:35.760> doing

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
we could always see what they're doing

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.700 
we could always see what they're doing
and<00:02:36.240> when<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.080> what<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> animated

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
and when you can see what the animated

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.650 
and when you can see what the animated
team<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.010> doing<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.460> very<00:02:39.180> obvious<00:02:39.570> what

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
team is doing it's very obvious what

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.150 
team is doing it's very obvious what
they're<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.020> next<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.800> as<00:02:41.010> long<00:02:41.100> as

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
they're going to do next so as long as

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.470 
they're going to do next so as long as
we<00:02:41.250> don't<00:02:41.370> let<00:02:41.580> them<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.880> what<00:02:42.120> they're<00:02:42.240> trying

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
we don't let them do what they're trying

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.570 
we don't let them do what they're trying
to<00:02:42.600> do<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.650> no<00:02:43.770> options<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.250> any<00:02:44.370> place

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
to do they have no options of any place

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.250

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
something so you can just kill the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
jungler and then you have so much

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.300 
jungler and then you have so much
mobility<00:03:24.959> with<00:03:25.290> your<00:03:25.440> w<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:25.770> didn't<00:03:26.010> even<00:03:26.100> buy

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
second item that game just because they

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.370 
second item that game just because they

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
isn't a ton of damage and she just

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.090 
isn't a ton of damage and she just
really<00:03:33.750> does<00:03:33.900> everything<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.500> jungler<00:03:34.800> needs

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
really does everything a jungler needs

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.530 
really does everything a jungler needs
to<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.310> if<00:03:35.430> she<00:03:35.520> had<00:03:35.610> CC<00:03:35.970> she<00:03:36.209> would<00:03:36.330> just<00:03:36.450> be

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
to do if she had CC she would just be

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.050 
to do if she had CC she would just be
too<00:03:36.780> good<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.250> aside<00:03:38.250> from<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.430> she's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
too good but aside from that she's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.790 
too good but aside from that she's
really<00:03:39.209> solid<00:03:39.630> she's<00:03:40.080> kind<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.620> carry

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800

immediately when you're ahead and a lot

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.270 
immediately when you're ahead and a lot
of<00:04:09.240> times<00:04:09.420> we<00:04:09.510> find<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.750> lull<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.320> game<00:04:10.530> so

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
of times we find a lull in a game so

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.030 
of times we find a lull in a game so
high<00:04:11.910> where<00:04:12.180> do<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.390> guys<00:04:12.540> look<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.170> team<00:04:13.770> to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
high where do you guys look as a team to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.770 
high where do you guys look as a team to
press<00:04:14.459> advantages<00:04:15.060> when<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.300> kind<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.600> do

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
press advantages when you kind of do

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.530 
press advantages when you kind of do
fall<00:04:16.109> into<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.770> mid<00:04:17.070> game<00:04:17.280> well<00:04:18.150> we've

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
fall into that mid game well we've

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.970 
fall into that mid game well we've
actually<00:04:18.750> had<00:04:19.080> discussions<00:04:19.680> about<00:04:19.709> this

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
actually had discussions about this

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.409 
actually had discussions about this
before<00:04:20.340> where<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.669> take<00:04:20.820> all<00:04:21.060> three<00:04:21.270> other

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
before where we take all three other

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.610 
before where we take all three other
turrets<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.810> we<00:04:21.930> don't<00:04:22.080> know<00:04:22.290> what<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.500> do

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
turrets and we don't know what to do

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.140 
turrets and we don't know what to do
after<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:23.580> those<00:04:23.700> second-tier

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
after so it's because those second-tier

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.330 
after so it's because those second-tier
tours<00:04:24.360> aren't<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.660> say<00:04:25.080> any<00:04:25.290> ridiculous<00:04:25.860> you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
tours aren't and say any ridiculous you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.860 
tours aren't and say any ridiculous you
can't<00:04:26.550> really

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
can't really

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.060 
can't really
take<00:04:27.050> those<00:04:27.199> turrets<00:04:27.470> even<00:04:27.740> if<00:04:27.830> you're<00:04:27.919> like<00:04:28.010> a

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
take those turrets even if you're like a

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.230 
take those turrets even if you're like a
little<00:04:28.280> bit<00:04:28.400> ahead<00:04:28.490> unless<00:04:28.790> they<00:04:29.060> like<00:04:29.180> that

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
little bit ahead unless they like that

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.390 
little bit ahead unless they like that
out<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.600> there<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.530> you're<00:04:30.889> given<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.220> few

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
out of there so you're given a few

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.620 
out of there so you're given a few
options<00:04:31.729> left<00:04:31.790> you<00:04:32.030> either<00:04:32.180> have<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.510> do

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
options left you either have to do

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.969 
options left you either have to do
dragon<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.110> it's<00:04:33.260> dead<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.530> can't<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.800> that

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
dragon if it's dead you can't do that

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.860 
dragon if it's dead you can't do that
bear<00:04:34.610> doesn't<00:04:34.880> spawn<00:04:35.150> till<00:04:35.330> 20<00:04:35.570> minutes<00:04:35.810> so

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
bear doesn't spawn till 20 minutes so

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.150 
bear doesn't spawn till 20 minutes so
you<00:04:35.900> can't<00:04:36.110> do<00:04:36.199> it<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.290> either<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:36.860> your<00:04:36.979> only

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
you can't do it that either so your only

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.189 
you can't do it that either so your only
option<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:37.639> basically<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.210> ward<00:04:38.449> up<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.810> see

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
option is basically to ward up and see

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.540 
option is basically to ward up and see
what<00:04:39.380> they<00:04:39.470> do<00:04:39.560> if<00:04:39.680> they've<00:04:39.860> try<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.250> get<00:04:40.490> a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
what they do if they've try to get a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.890 
what they do if they've try to get a
fight<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.000> get<00:04:41.150> good<00:04:41.300> fight<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.540> great

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
fight and you get good fight and great

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.840 
fight and you get good fight and great
if<00:04:42.080> not<00:04:42.440> you're<00:04:42.800> basically<00:04:43.280> left<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.639> just

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
if not you're basically left to just

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.909 
if not you're basically left to just
farm<00:04:44.060> or<00:04:44.300> try<00:04:44.540> get<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.750> pic<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:45.530> they<00:04:45.710> really

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
farm or try get a pic but they really

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.409 
farm or try get a pic but they really
aren't<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.340> many<00:04:46.520> options<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.000> do<00:04:47.150> after

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
aren't that many options to do after

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.090 
aren't that many options to do after
those<00:04:47.570> first<00:04:47.690> three<00:04:47.960> attitude<00:04:48.320> took<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.680> do

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
those first three attitude took on do

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.500 
those first three attitude took on do
you<00:04:49.190> feel<00:04:49.400> like<00:04:49.490> there<00:04:49.699> might<00:04:49.910> be<00:04:49.970> kind<00:04:50.389> of<00:04:50.419> a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
you feel like there might be kind of a

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.330 
you feel like there might be kind of a
resurgence<00:04:51.050> of<00:04:51.229> siege<00:04:51.440> comps<00:04:51.860> give<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.160> like

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
resurgence of siege comps give it like

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.340 
resurgence of siege comps give it like
with<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.790> ability<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.210> disengage<00:04:53.840> in<00:04:54.139> order

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
with the ability to disengage in order

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.960 
with the ability to disengage in order
to<00:04:54.470> maybe<00:04:54.860> make<00:04:55.100> an<00:04:55.250> effort<00:04:55.370> at<00:04:55.580> pushing<00:04:55.790> the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
to maybe make an effort at pushing the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.520 
to maybe make an effort at pushing the
second-tier<00:04:56.389> turrets<00:04:56.690> before<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.260> 20

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
second-tier turrets before that 20

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.560 
second-tier turrets before that 20
minute<00:04:57.740> mark<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:58.130> don't<00:04:59.000> even<00:04:59.090> think<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.389> siege

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
minute mark I don't even think a siege

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.850 
minute mark I don't even think a siege
concrete<00:04:59.900> take<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.229> second<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.620> turn

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
concrete take that second to turn

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.860 
concrete take that second to turn
honestly<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.460> if<00:05:01.580> they're<00:05:02.030> there<00:05:02.419> defending

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
honestly like if they're there defending

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.810 
honestly like if they're there defending
it<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:03.320> much<00:05:03.530> easier<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.919> defend<00:05:04.340> deter<00:05:04.610> then

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
it it's much easier to defend deter then

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.640 
it it's much easier to defend deter then
is<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.120> take<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.419> turret<00:05:05.660> so<00:05:06.169> at<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.500> moment

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
is to take the turret so at the moment

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.620 
is to take the turret so at the moment
do<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.310> really<00:05:07.610> not<00:05:07.820> give<00:05:08.000> them<00:05:08.060> any<00:05:08.180> options

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
do you really not give them any options

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.140 
do you really not give them any options
to<00:05:08.690> do<00:05:08.870> 3<00:05:09.380> 20<00:05:09.650> minutes<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.100> so<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.610> Italy<00:05:10.880> again

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
to do 3 20 minutes and so in Italy again

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.490 
to do 3 20 minutes and so in Italy again
is<00:05:11.300> another<00:05:11.389> one<00:05:11.600> of<00:05:11.630> those<00:05:11.750> junglers<00:05:12.199> than<00:05:12.380> if

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
is another one of those junglers than if

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.930 
is another one of those junglers than if
you're<00:05:12.620> looking<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:12.979> capitalize<00:05:13.520> on<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
you're looking to capitalize on the

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.279 
you're looking to capitalize on the
vision<00:05:14.180> control<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.690> guys<00:05:14.870> play<00:05:15.080> do<00:05:15.199> you

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
vision control that you guys play do you

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.629 
vision control that you guys play do you
think<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.740> is<00:05:15.889> one<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.310> stronger

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
think that that is one of the stronger

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.000 
think that that is one of the stronger
or<00:05:17.120> what<00:05:17.389> should<00:05:17.810> rephrase<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.560> question<00:05:18.590> as

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
or what should rephrase the question as

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.890 
or what should rephrase the question as
what<00:05:19.430> other<00:05:19.639> junglers<00:05:20.210> would<00:05:20.630> you<00:05:20.750> look

what other junglers would you look

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.300 
what other junglers would you look

towards me do aside from Italy to

strong<00:06:55.770> that's<00:06:56.249> a<00:06:56.310> really<00:06:56.520> hard<00:06:56.550> one<00:06:56.849> we

00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:56.999 
strong that's a really hard one we

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.279 
strong that's a really hard one we
practice<00:06:57.449> first<00:06:57.599> both<00:06:57.779> them<00:06:57.930> a<00:06:57.990> lot<00:06:58.139> and

CLG<00:07:01.050> might<00:07:01.319> be<00:07:02.099> a<00:07:02.129> little<00:07:02.279> stronger<00:07:02.550> just

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:02.939

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:04.279
