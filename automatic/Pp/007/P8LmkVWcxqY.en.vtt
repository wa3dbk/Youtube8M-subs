00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
all are you good that you've added or

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.869 
all are you good that you've added or
the<00:00:54.660> recipe<00:00:54.840> says<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.920> less<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> also

the recipe says is less you can also

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
the recipe says is less you can also
adjust<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.660> by<00:00:57.870> adding<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.320> amount<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
adjust this by adding some amount of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
adjust this by adding some amount of
water<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.399> after<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.300> once<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> have

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
water and after that once you have

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
water and after that once you have
needed<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.649> well<00:01:01.949> you'll<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
needed all of this well you'll get this

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
needed all of this well you'll get this
nice<00:01:02.730> soft<00:01:03.239> dough<00:01:03.390> which<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.589> roll

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
nice soft dough which you will now roll

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
nice soft dough which you will now roll
so<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> dough<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.390> in

thing<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.680> we'll<00:01:11.070> divide<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thing that we will do we'll divide this

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
thing that we will do we'll divide this
into<00:01:11.970> equal<00:01:12.780> portions<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> very

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
into equal portions this is a very

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
into equal portions this is a very
healthy<00:01:14.549> Thea<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.330> replace<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
healthy Thea I can actually replace this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
healthy Thea I can actually replace this
with<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> paratha<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.250> generally

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
have for breakfast so to begin with

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
have for breakfast so to begin with
we'll<00:01:19.830> first<00:01:20.130> need<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> tava<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.360> getting

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
we'll first need a tava which is getting

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
we'll first need a tava which is getting
heated<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.189> portion<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
heated here so take one portion of the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.390 
heated here so take one portion of the
dough<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.720> need<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> roll<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.530> don't

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
dough and now we need to roll this don't

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730 
dough and now we need to roll this don't
worry<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.060> cracked<00:01:27.360> edges<00:01:27.780> Raj<00:01:28.409> Geeta

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
worry about the cracked edges Raj Geeta

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.859 
worry about the cracked edges Raj Geeta
utter<00:01:28.979> doesn't<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.520> gluten<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
utter doesn't have gluten so it's a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.850 
utter doesn't have gluten so it's a
little<00:01:31.079> difficult<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> dough<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
little difficult for the dough to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.609 
little difficult for the dough to
stretch<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> adjust<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> added

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stretch so to adjust that we have added

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
stretch so to adjust that we have added
whole<00:01:34.860> wheat<00:01:35.040> flour<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> cracked<00:01:36.570> edges

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
whole wheat flour so the cracked edges

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
whole wheat flour so the cracked edges
are<00:01:37.079> surely<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
are surely going to be there but the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.160 
are surely going to be there but the
paella<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.270> definitely<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> taste<00:01:40.049> very

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
paella is definitely going to taste very

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
paella is definitely going to taste very
tasty<00:01:40.710> okay<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.030> done<00:01:43.759> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.240> tava

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
tasty okay so this is done on the tava

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:56.569 
tasty okay so this is done on the tava
in<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.049> meanwhile<00:01:46.470> let's<00:01:46.740> make<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.310> more

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.760 

okay<00:01:57.579> so<00:01:57.880> let's<00:01:58.090> cook<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.229> other<00:01:59.380> side<00:01:59.619> as
