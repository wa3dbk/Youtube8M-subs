00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.270 
I was a little kid and we really like it
but<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.170> gotta<00:04:13.379> know<00:04:13.469> when<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.739> think<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.069> may

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
but if I gotta know when I think I may

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.619 
but if I gotta know when I think I may
get<00:04:14.489> an<00:04:14.609> x<00:04:14.760> mark<00:04:14.819> just<00:04:15.120> because<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.450> dealer

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
get an x mark just because the dealer

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.740 
get an x mark just because the dealer
support<00:04:16.519> it's<00:04:17.519> not<00:04:17.669> even<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.910> close<00:04:18.180> dealer<00:04:18.570> but

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
support it's not even a close dealer but

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.499 
support it's not even a close dealer but
it's<00:04:18.900> they're<00:04:19.500> really<00:04:20.250> sharp<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.880> it's<00:04:21.060> very

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
it's they're really sharp and it's very

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.760 
it's they're really sharp and it's very
fast<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.630> support<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:25.259> x<00:04:25.380> marks

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
