00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we down here the amplifiers you'll see

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.420 
we down here the amplifiers you'll see
here<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> those<00:00:37.410> old<00:00:37.469> school<00:00:37.950> fans<00:00:38.129> might

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
here some of those old school fans might

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.979 
here some of those old school fans might
recognize<00:00:38.879> something<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.420> amplifiers

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
recognize something on this amplifiers

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
recognize something on this amplifiers
or<00:00:40.379> try<00:00:41.280> blue<00:00:41.730> LED<00:00:42.290> over<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:44.030> obviously<00:00:45.030> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
or try blue LED over them obviously this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
or try blue LED over them obviously this
amplifier<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.719> called<00:00:45.930> titanium<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.649> those

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
amplifier is called titanium for those

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
amplifier is called titanium for those
old-school<00:00:47.010> phoenix<00:00:47.489> gold<00:00:47.610> pans<00:00:47.879> they'll

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
old-school phoenix gold pans they'll

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.479 
old-school phoenix gold pans they'll
know<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.539> sure<00:00:48.570> yes<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.829> 1500

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
know that for sure yes this is the 1500

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
know that for sure yes this is the 1500
watt<00:00:50.610> mono<00:00:50.820> block<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:53.780> you've<00:00:54.780> got<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
watt mono block here you've got all the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.279 
watt mono block here you've got all the
controls<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> front<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> amplifier

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
controls on the front of the amplifier

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.770 
controls on the front of the amplifier
we<00:00:58.289> also<00:00:58.410> make<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> 2500<00:00:59.730> watt<00:00:59.850> how<00:01:00.719> do

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
we also make that in a 2500 watt how do

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
we also make that in a 2500 watt how do
you<00:01:00.840> count<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.710> that's<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.129> that's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you count and that's it that's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.210 
you count and that's it that's
entry-level<00:01:03.229> that's<00:01:04.229> their<00:01:04.500> high-end<00:01:04.949> level

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
entry-level that's their high-end level

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
entry-level that's their high-end level
it's<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.610> say<00:01:05.850> cuz<00:01:06.090> turn<00:01:06.540> off<00:01:06.720> kilowatts

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's about to say cuz turn off kilowatts

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920 
it's about to say cuz turn off kilowatts
ain't<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.409> amateurs<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.850> s400<00:01:09.360> 4

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
ain't for amateurs is it the s400 4

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.980 
ain't for amateurs is it the s400 4
that's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.140> 4<00:01:10.170> channel<00:01:10.350> version<00:01:10.770> slightly

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's a 4 channel version slightly

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
that's a 4 channel version slightly
example<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> slightly<00:01:13.350> smaller<00:01:13.470> footprint

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
example is a slightly smaller footprint

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
example is a slightly smaller footprint
in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.189> air<00:01:14.340> than<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> r300<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> different

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
in the air than the r300 is a different

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
in the air than the r300 is a different
class<00:01:15.900> event<00:01:16.229> yeah<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.830> S<00:01:16.920> 4.4<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.060> full

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
class event yeah the S 4.4 that's a full

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
class event yeah the S 4.4 that's a full
that's<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> Class<00:01:19.740> A<00:01:19.920> B<00:01:20.070> amplifier<00:01:20.549> huh<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that's the Class A B amplifier huh and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
that's the Class A B amplifier huh and
it's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> four<00:01:21.840> channel<00:01:22.049> alright<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.860> very

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's a four channel alright and very

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
it's a four channel alright and very
convenient<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:23.909> fit<00:01:24.210> anywhere<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> need

amplifiers<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.440> one<00:03:20.620> really<00:03:20.859> carries<00:03:21.190> on

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
amplifiers and the one really carries on

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.309 
amplifiers and the one really carries on
that<00:03:21.489> tradition<00:03:21.549> so<00:03:22.269> good<00:03:22.450> i'm<00:03:22.599> going<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:22.959> talk

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
that tradition so good i'm going in talk

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.319 
that tradition so good i'm going in talk
to<00:03:23.470> me<00:03:23.560> yeah<00:03:24.040> what<00:03:24.609> you're<00:03:24.790> looking<00:03:25.060> at<00:03:25.150> is

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
to me yeah what you're looking at is

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.759 
to me yeah what you're looking at is

2491<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:30.110> just<00:04:30.290> really<00:04:30.470> made<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.919> say<00:04:31.100> twenty

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
2491 it just really made you say twenty

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760 
2491 it just really made you say twenty
four<00:04:31.790> thousand<00:04:32.480> what<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.990> can<00:04:33.260> find<00:04:33.410> sorry

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
four thousand what you can find sorry

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.560 
four thousand what you can find sorry
than<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.010> can<00:04:34.160> handle<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.940> that's<00:04:35.390> going

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
than you can handle that so that's going

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.360 
than you can handle that so that's going
to<00:04:35.630> be<00:04:35.690> quite<00:04:35.930> an<00:04:36.050> array<00:04:36.169> of<00:04:36.380> speakers<00:04:36.950> in<00:04:37.250> it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
to be quite an array of speakers in it

look<00:04:48.800> at<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:48.950> what<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.280> piece<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.520> kit<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:49.910> you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
look at that what a piece of kit so you

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.630 
look at that what a piece of kit so you
can<00:04:50.150> see<00:04:50.300> why<00:04:50.450> fins<00:04:50.690> called<00:04:51.460> arouses<00:04:52.460> such

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
can see why fins called arouses such

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.920 
can see why fins called arouses such
excitement<00:04:53.000> amongst<00:04:53.300> us<00:04:53.450> Brits<00:04:53.720> because

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
excitement amongst us Brits because

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.750 
excitement amongst us Brits because
we're<00:04:54.410> known<00:04:54.590> as<00:04:54.620> being<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:55.010> bit<00:04:55.160> degenerate
