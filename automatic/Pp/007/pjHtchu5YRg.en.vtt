 Some up fishtank persons, fishtanktv.com Dustin's aquariums. My crazy problem and obsession that I have fun with. Two before Tuesday stays, it might even be triple Tuesday I don't know. I dirting a tank and I want everything that you beginners and new endorse the best way to grow aquarium plants and it is just like freaking this. I have so many mosquitos around me, even though I drove all the way to CVS to get bug spray. This is how much dirt. That's my finger in the dirt. Take it up. That's how much dirt I use. I also have some special ingredients inherently that I just don't intend to share and maybe I will. I feel good today. I use that much dirt, guess how much gravel I use. It's probably about the same ratio. The special ingredients in these are here. I have some iron ore, I don't recommend using this to cook the whole batch. I am not saying this to anyone I have not experimented with it, I do not know what I am doing. I have heard good things and I think I have seen some good things in some of my tanks but by no means do what I do. If you have iron in your tanks don't send me an email saying that you have already killed your plants. I'm telling you not to try this. I try it, I would kill some plants or they could grow shit home. So that's what's the matter. I have about 15 of them there. Then I have 30 pieces of this clay. I'm going to be able to wear it in a little bit here. About 30 pieces of these 3 rows over 10 in each column. Now what I do is the slow fill method that I learned about on fishtanktv.com, put in the dirt forum written by Shane. And I'm just going to get this going. And you know what I just can't resist I'm probably going to plant it tonight. But humans spend the extra $ 7 on some bug spray. Back here because it's like mosquitoes heaven. Long time subscriber young guy only 15 years old am Petterson, bens aquariums is his YouTube channel I think. He sent me a very intelligent e-mail about sand versus gravel. A lot has been said about that. I am a gravel guy I roll with gravel, I think this size maybe a little smaller is the best. I don't like sand and I have a tank in my basement that I use with sand and it's just trouble. I thought why, it's because it doesn't allow oxygen to get to the roots, so it becomes anaerobic which means no oxygen. Every now and then it's released and it just destroys everything that's why I had that huge scourge in that tank. Or it will just boil the roots and kill the plants. Anyway it is not so I am going rolling with gravel people and I suggest you do the same. Really big question I'm glad you're on the channel I know you have been a subscriber for a long time. If you want my 2 cents gravel over sand. It will put that oxygen down in the dirt. It is the same kind of principle as why it is good to have worms in your yard because the air speed help, it is the same kind of deal air rate your dirt. So um yep. Go to see how this goes. It always takes you to complete, but that's a good thing. The dirt underneath was not too wet, a little damp, but not too bad. I do this slowly, so I don't have a float up. Here's the best part, if I change to water I can do a little more than do the stupid thing. And then I'm going to get growth like that and it's going to be great. And then winter is coming and I have to stay inside all the time, but my shit will look great. So that's what's up, welcome new subscribers. Hit me up, tons of this stuff for sale $ 3 here. You do not think that it is crazy to grow in your tank from your skull. And do what we do as usual. Later on.
