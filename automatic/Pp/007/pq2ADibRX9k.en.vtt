00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.510
 Argentines and with an excellent proposal

 beyond that next week in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.400
 Easter and religious holidays but 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.960
 It can be a good option of all 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 ways also for the coming week 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.590
 we are preparing a question 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.340
 important of proposals for relationship with 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 easter egg main dish thread 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 stop everything now here good after 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.750
 half a kilo of hake so what 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.090
 we cook with water 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 about 10 minutes 12 minutes and what 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
 we make is to crumble this be firm of 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 hake, what we are going to add is 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 second after the one presented also as 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.270
 we did previously but with oil and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270
 green bell pepper 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.270
 it has served me very little time can be 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.280
 in water it can be in vegetable broth and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.850
 an option adds the sautÃ©ed onion 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.850
 with the with 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.820
 we mixed with the end of perfect hake 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.820
 and I wanted to add a little salt 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.640
 and there was a little bit of salt 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.590
 and we should add mackerel well that's going 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.870
 to lift the force something exactly and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.090
 it is very very economic to launch the tuna 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.910
 quietly with mackerel there is no 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.590
 flavor there is strong protagonist going to 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.280
 Be well leveled with the mixture of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.280
 stain that soft but very rich the story 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.420
 it's short there was a good 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.539
 amount we mix that there is below 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:02.710
 they are passing the perfect recipe for 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:04.390
 that friends take note and skin and go to 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.670
 see as a specialist when it comes to 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.830
 cooking is a little bit so you do not 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.179
 they want to take off then a good 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.190
 amount of toy tomatitos to two 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.739
 they tomato like a diced 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.130
 exactly and that's it 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.330
 we are in an hour and a half as fresh 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.250
 alternative to libya 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.230
 like to eat 4852 the contest and the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.190
 tomatito elevate a particular taste 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.620
 because it's going to be like a kind 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:36.760
 request baked and they will stay 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:39.400
 here it is very important that everything 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.040
 there is in 30 seconds we are eating 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.540
 all this innumerable amount of bread to 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.610
 discussion of the detected and was that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.610
