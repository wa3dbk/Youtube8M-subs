00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.599 
contender which ended up being a a
clusterfuck<00:03:16.569> as<00:03:16.780> well<00:03:17.310> basically<00:03:18.310> with<00:03:18.579> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
clusterfuck as well basically with the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.030 
clusterfuck as well basically with the
you<00:03:19.060> know<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.359> pay-per-view<00:03:20.230> ended<00:03:20.680> up<00:03:20.799> being

you know the pay-per-view ended up being

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.310 
you know the pay-per-view ended up being
a<00:03:21.220> fatal<00:03:21.579> 4-way<00:03:22.090> with<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.540> big<00:03:22.660> man<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:23.170> every

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
a fatal 4-way with the big man in every

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.470 
a fatal 4-way with the big man in every
corner<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:24.160> think<00:03:24.730> that's<00:03:24.940> pretty<00:03:25.209> much<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
corner I think that's pretty much the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.610 
corner I think that's pretty much the
same<00:03:25.810> thing<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.109> we're<00:03:26.350> going<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.500> be

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
same thing that we're going to be

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.280 
same thing that we're going to be
getting<00:03:26.799> here<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.609> bass<00:03:28.329> line<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.840> basically

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
getting here on bass line is basically

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.110 
getting here on bass line is basically
the<00:03:29.440> Roman<00:03:29.799> reigns<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.250> Daniel<00:03:30.609> Bryan<00:03:30.640> more

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
the Roman reigns and Daniel Bryan more

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.960 
the Roman reigns and Daniel Bryan more
than<00:03:31.239> likely<00:03:31.390> will<00:03:31.660> end<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.079> some<00:03:32.380> kind<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.769> a

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
than likely will end in some kind of a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.270 
than likely will end in some kind of a
weirdo<00:03:33.970> false<00:03:34.359> finish<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.140> because<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:35.950> this

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
weirdo false finish and because of this

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.030 
weirdo false finish and because of this
we<00:03:36.549> are<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.930> be<00:03:38.019> getting<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.410> three<00:03:38.769> way
