wider than six inches if you don't need
it<00:01:50.909> real<00:01:51.180> full<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it real full because you have just a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.910 
it real full because you have just a
tiny<00:01:53.159> child<00:01:53.840> then<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.869> could<00:01:55.229> even<00:01:55.500> cut<00:01:55.799> them

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
tiny child then you could even cut them

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.090 
tiny child then you could even cut them
as<00:01:56.100> narrow<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.549> four<00:01:57.090> inches<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.860> see

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
as narrow as four inches so you can see

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.609 
as narrow as four inches so you can see
that<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.460> starting<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> bunch<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.229> again

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that it's starting to bunch up so again

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.630 
that it's starting to bunch up so again
I<00:02:01.920> take<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.520> Center<00:02:03.270> fold<00:02:03.979> place<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> under

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
I take that Center fold place it under

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.619 
I take that Center fold place it under
the<00:02:05.790> ribbon<00:02:06.770> pull<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.009> ends<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.729> through<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the ribbon pull the ends up through that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.870 
the ribbon pull the ends up through that
loop

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
loop

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.780 
loop
and<00:02:12.880> pull<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.540> down<00:02:13.870> tight<00:02:14.680> I'm<00:02:15.580> going<00:02:15.730> to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and pull that down tight I'm going to

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.730 
and pull that down tight I'm going to
add<00:02:15.970> another<00:02:16.120> ribbon<00:02:16.780> here<00:02:16.990> now<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.350> give<00:02:17.620> it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
add another ribbon here now to give it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.390 
add another ribbon here now to give it
some<00:02:17.950> variety<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.780> again<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.380> take<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.800> center

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
some variety so again I take the center
