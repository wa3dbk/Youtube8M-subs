Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.680
Today we’re going to show you how to change
an oven door hinge on your range.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.780
It’s a really easy job; all you’ll need
is a Phillips screw driver, and a pair of

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.780
pliers.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.160
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.830
Now to begin this repair we’ll start by
removing the oven door so we’ll open it

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.000
to the broil position (it should stay there
by itself), and while grasping both sides

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.210
we’ll just pull straight up and that disengages
it from the hinges.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.260
We can now set the door aside.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.510
Now our next step will be to put the hinge
into the closed position so it doesn’t snap

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.930
back unexpectedly and pinch you.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.540
Then we’ll pull the storage drawer out until
it meets its stop and then we’ll tilt up

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.350
on the front, and pull it all the way out.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.590
That will give us access to the hook on the
spring that attaches to the lower portion

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.079
of that hinge.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:05.900
So before we disengage that, take note of
what notch on the hinge is being used, and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.190
then we can disengage that hook.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.950
You may need a pair of needle nose pliers.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.690
With our needle nose pliers we’ll just lift
up on that spring and disengage it from that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.830
hole.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.320
We can make sure the spring doesn’t fall
out of the hole in the base of the frame.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.420
We’ll next remove three Phillips screws
that secure the hinge to the base frame of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.960
the range.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:46.170
Then we can remove the old hinge and discard
it.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:59.520
Now to install our new hinge, we’ll just
insert it through the hole, and reinstall

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.460
the three screws.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:18.200
Make sure you tighten all three screws securely.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:33.500
Now we’re ready to connect the spring on
the proper location on the hinge.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.280
Again you may need your needle nose pliers
to do this or two hands: one to hold the bottom

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.990
of the hinge and the other to engage the spring.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.050
Check the operation of it.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.480
Now while you have the oven apart you should
probably check the hinge on the opposite side

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.960
if you weren’t all ready changing two of
them, chances are they’ll both wear at the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.100
same time and you may need to replace the
other one at this time.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.830
Now we’re ready to put the storage drawer
back in place.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:17.810
Line the rear glides up, lift it over the
stops, slide it into position, and we’re

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.540
ready to reinstall the door.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.700
Now we’re ready to reinstall the door, we’ll
line up these two openings in the bottom with

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:36.770
the tops of the hinges, just catch one of
them, and line it up with the other one, slide

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.790
it down firmly into place, check the operation,
and our repair is complete.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.320
Told you it was an easy job.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.610
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
