cutting-edge high-tech data flow plays a

major role in the development of our new

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:47.190 
major role in the development of our new
generation<00:03:41.499> of<00:03:41.709> tires<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:46.269> way<00:03:46.540> we've

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
generation of tires in this way we've

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.080 
generation of tires in this way we've
been<00:03:47.230> manufacturing<00:03:47.590> far<00:03:48.370> more<00:03:48.549> durable<00:03:48.969> and

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
been manufacturing far more durable and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.270 
been manufacturing far more durable and
superior<00:03:49.629> performance<00:03:50.109> tires<00:03:50.349> while<00:03:51.069> also

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
superior performance tires while also

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.920 
superior performance tires while also
keeping<00:03:51.670> our<00:03:51.760> sights<00:03:52.030> on<00:03:52.209> advancing<00:03:52.719> further

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
keeping our sights on advancing further

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:01.410 
keeping our sights on advancing further
the<00:03:53.170> research<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.650> development<00:03:53.680> process

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.480 

now<00:04:02.420> think<00:04:02.960> again<00:04:03.080> about<00:04:03.710> what<00:04:03.920> kind<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.370> an

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
now think again about what kind of an

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.370 
now think again about what kind of an
engineering<00:04:04.940> intelligence<00:04:05.570> goes<00:04:05.960> into<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
engineering intelligence goes into the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:28.559 
engineering intelligence goes into the
tires<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.830> your<00:04:06.860> car

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569
