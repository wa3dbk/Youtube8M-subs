00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello friends has reached techno systech 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 the new 9.920 s is about a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.310
 smartphone of equal characteristics or 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 similar to a galaxy s3 mini like 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.650
 can see we have it available so much 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.280
 in blue color as in white color such 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.610
 How are the originals already good? 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.740
 I tell friends that unlike this 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.210
 team has the same screen and the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
 same size the same way as a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.329
 galaxy s3 mini but they have some 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 small differences that we are going to 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 tell apart from the brand obviously and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.840
 the price that is a pretty variant 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.450
 important 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.320
 and good 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.690
 as you can see here 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 this phone unlike the original 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.559
 has the dual sim system that we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 allows to work with 232 chip at the same 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 time of different companies this these 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.519
 phones have led for all 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.410
 national companies 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.020
 and as you can see it supports the normal sim 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.640
 and the micro sim or we have even the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.250
 two sim options that are available 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.800
 in the market also as you can see 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.080
 acaps supports expansion by means of 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.080
 a micro sd memory of up to 32 gigabytes 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.020
 good another important feature of 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.020
 this phone 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.450
 is that it has a camera that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 you can see here that it is 12 megapixels 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.929
 12 megapixels is 4 megapixels more 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.060
 that what the original brings is already a 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.479
 quite powerful camera for both video 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.610
 as for photography we are going to perform 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 some features that so that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.329
 you can compare and perform 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.869
 against what is a galaxy s3 mini 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.869
 original 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.549
 important is this because in the market 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.979
 there are replicas that you can 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.780
 find maybe 60 thousand pesos 70 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.820
 thousand pesos in this same portal even 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.830
 there are some some models that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.720
 They appear to be the same but not really 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.250
 they are the same in terms of their ability 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.380
 which it is really what matters to 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.350
 have a good screen have good 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.170
 endings already and have a good 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.140
 processor a good memory of that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.540
 things that are going to make a difference in 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.370
 the use of the telephone and we will not have 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.600
 a phone that is going to be very slow or 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.100
 just do not meet our 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.020
 expectations 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.450
 this phone like you are going to be able 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.940
 appreciate has exactly the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.760
 features of a mini f3 and even 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.790
 has some improvements 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.920
 as you can see here the cpu is dual core 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.769
 that is extremely important double core 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.829
 a trip or we have a processor 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.349
 dual of a day yours another feature 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.110
 important is that your screen is 480 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.170
 x 800 of a fairly large resolution 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.540
 for a 4-inch screen that does not 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.790
 it's so big in the background which the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.120
 base that you see a screen very well you 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.650
 see the photos so much all the images 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.409
 that we can reproduce in this 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.390
 screen will look very good 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.849
 good quality has a part has 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.060
 also the screen is 5 points what 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.470
 that makes it have a very sensitive point 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.470
 very fast 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.680
 and good as I told you before 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.620
 the camera is 12 megapixels and the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.740
 frontal that you see here is 3.1 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.740
 megapixels that's pretty even already 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.440
 more than the original its integrated memory 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.290
 is 4 gigabytes and its ram memory is 512 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.970
 pretty good if we consider it are 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.610
 practically the same characteristics 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.240
 that a galaxy s2 for you to be 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.240
 an idea 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.460
 good 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.780
 in relation to what is 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:14.860
 system this team has the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.920
 Android version that is 4.1.1 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.560
 since it is a very advanced version 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.410
 of Android while it is not the last one is already 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.460
 a version that has some 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.720
 improvements that had power were improved 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.670
 some flaws of the first one is like 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.080
 the consumption of the battery in this not in 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.640
 this version you are going to find a 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.790
 much more optimized consumption of 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.480
 battery among other things within the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.030
 package as you can see here 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.480
 good equipment comes in this box 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.490
 they come with their respective manual their 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.009
 charger 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.910
 how can you see here a kit hearing aid 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.370
 hands-free your cable 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.740
 and this case that is a cover for Peru 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.740
 of the soft gel type of gift 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:10.490
 and good additionally in techno systech 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.259
 we have looked for the way to satisfy 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.810
 well to our customers if they come 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.460
 looking for good quality equipment 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.860
 We have a variety of equipment 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.009
 important this equipment is the most 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.039
 economic that we have but it is 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.880
 pretty good it's very fast how can 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.880
 appreciate here 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.440
 If you notice the touch, respond to 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.840
 shot has no problems 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.570
 already 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.010
 but as I was saying we have a range 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.230
 wide range of phones for you 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.100
 can choose in case this is not 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.100
 of your entire satisfaction 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:06:01.689
 as I told them the s 3 minis at 99 900 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:03.819
 and then we have a replica of the iphone 5 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.159
 we also have a one-to-one replica 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.499
 of the Galaxy S 4 available in two models 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.169
 so you can get an idea 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:15.819
 version with dual-core processor and a 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:18.909
 giga de ram costs 139 900 and you have another 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.940
 version with quad-core processor in 169 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:26.730
 900 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.220
 the android out or be that 9500 of 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.160
 this is a pretty powerful team very 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.690
 similar to galaxy s 4 with some 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.000
 important characteristics as a 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.530
 great camera a processor of any 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.130
 core among other things 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.300
 and well we also have for those who 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.180
 they like the screen equipment of 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.520
 we have the copy of the galaxy nou 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.400
 two 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.889
 this is a copy quite similar to 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.380
 original with a very large screen of 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:59.240
 52 inches 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:04.310
 and a dual 1.2 processor a memory 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.780
 and 512 for a small price of 139,900 and 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.400
 good friends we hope you have them 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.540
 liked this video and we wait for you 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.540
 front and there are no
