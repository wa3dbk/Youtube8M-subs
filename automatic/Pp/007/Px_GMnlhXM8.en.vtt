00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
rare prototype amiibos that were

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.040 
rare prototype amiibos that were
actually<00:00:15.639> straight<00:00:15.969> from<00:00:16.180> japan<00:00:16.570> off<00:00:16.869> the

actually straight from japan off the
assembly<00:00:17.349> line<00:00:17.560> they<00:00:18.009> were<00:00:18.099> probably<00:00:18.460> stolen

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
assembly line they were probably stolen

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.120 
assembly line they were probably stolen

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
the jigglypuff amiibo versus the

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.889 
the jigglypuff amiibo versus the
prototype<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:45.399> also<00:00:45.850> this<00:00:46.120> black<00:00:46.480> peach

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
prototype and also this black peach

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.310 
prototype and also this black peach
prototype<00:00:47.530> which<00:00:47.710> is<00:00:47.859> very<00:00:48.249> very<00:00:48.519> interesting

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
prototype which is very very interesting

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.799 
prototype which is very very interesting
versus<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.800> regular<00:00:51.249> peach<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:51.969> was<00:00:52.539> sold

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
versus the regular peach that was sold

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.950 
versus the regular peach that was sold
in<00:00:53.109> stores<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.850> off<00:00:55.149> guys<00:00:55.359> I'm<00:00:55.629> gonna<00:00:55.749> go

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
can see this is the regular Jigglypuff

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.430 
can see this is the regular Jigglypuff
that<00:01:03.729> was<00:01:03.850> just<00:01:04.089> released<00:01:04.360> with<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> wave<00:01:05.050> for

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
that was just released with the wave for

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.880 
that was just released with the wave for
this<00:01:06.130> was<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.370> target<00:01:06.850> exclusive<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.560> was<00:01:08.680> kind

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
this was a target exclusive it was kind

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.530 
this was a target exclusive it was kind
of<00:01:08.950> hard<00:01:09.190> they're<00:01:09.610> not<00:01:09.790> hard<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.120> get<00:01:10.270> but<00:01:10.420> it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
of hard they're not hard to get but it

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.970 
of hard they're not hard to get but it
was<00:01:10.630> kind<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.870> easy<00:01:11.020> but<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.440> just<00:01:11.590> needed<00:01:11.800> to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
was kind of easy but you just needed to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.740 
was kind of easy but you just needed to
be<00:01:12.100> outside<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.700> store<00:01:13.000> when<00:01:13.180> they<00:01:13.330> opened

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
be outside of the store when they opened

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.080 
be outside of the store when they opened
as<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:14.470> can<00:01:14.620> see<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.310> bottom<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:15.940> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
as you can see on the bottom of the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.120 
as you can see on the bottom of the
amiibo<00:01:16.510> one<00:01:17.170> thing<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.530> really<00:01:17.680> stuck<00:01:17.980> out

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
amiibo one thing that really stuck out

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.270 
amiibo one thing that really stuck out
to<00:01:18.190> me<00:01:18.400> was<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:19.330> white<00:01:19.750> serial<00:01:20.680> number<00:01:21.160> that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
to me was the white serial number that

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.130 
to me was the white serial number that
was<00:01:21.430> on<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.850> bottom<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.720> regular

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
was on the bottom of the regular

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.790 
was on the bottom of the regular
Jigglypuff<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.160> was<00:01:24.340> not<00:01:24.760> on<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.990> prototype

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
Jigglypuff that was not on the prototype

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.010 
Jigglypuff that was not on the prototype
and<00:01:27.010> guys<00:01:27.190> these<00:01:27.490> quality<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.540> prototypes

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
and guys these quality of the prototypes

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.080 
and guys these quality of the prototypes
I<00:01:29.230> know<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.980> they're<00:01:30.190> real<00:01:30.520> because

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
I know that they're real because

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.420 
I know that they're real because
basically<00:01:31.390> they<00:01:32.170> look<00:01:32.200> exactly<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.190> same

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
basically they look exactly the same

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.800 
basically they look exactly the same
they're<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.940> painted<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.450> little<00:01:34.570> bit

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
they're just painted a little bit

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.990 
they're just painted a little bit
different<00:01:35.230> as<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.040> see<00:01:36.190> on<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.490> bottom

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
different as you can see on the bottom

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.780 
different as you can see on the bottom
of<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.420> base<00:01:37.840> are<00:01:38.380> not<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.250> base<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
of the base are not the base but the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.820 
of the base are not the base but the
feet<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.600> prototype<00:01:41.140> are<00:01:41.410> actually<00:01:41.770> a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
feet of the prototype are actually a

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.610 
feet of the prototype are actually a
different<00:01:42.250> shade<00:01:42.730> of<00:01:42.940> pink<00:01:43.240> compared<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.470> the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
different shade of pink compared to the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.980 
different shade of pink compared to the
regular<00:01:44.860> amiibo<00:01:45.550> also<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:46.480> one<00:01:46.690> does<00:01:46.840> not

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
regular amiibo also this one does not

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.200 
regular amiibo also this one does not
have<00:01:47.230> a<00:01:47.260> face<00:01:47.650> with<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.070> prototype<00:01:48.670> but<00:01:48.700> other

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
have a face with the prototype but other

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.600 
have a face with the prototype but other
than<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:50.050> noticed<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.800> arms<00:01:51.370> were

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
than that I noticed the arms were

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.460 
than that I noticed the arms were
actually<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.300> little<00:01:52.630> bit<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.050> different

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
actually in a little bit of a different

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.320 
actually in a little bit of a different
position<00:01:53.980> so<00:01:54.190> let's<00:01:54.370> take<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> further<00:01:55.030> look

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
position so let's take a further look

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810 
position so let's take a further look
into<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.050> do<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.320> 360<00:01:57.190> view<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
into this and do a 360 view of the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.650 
into this and do a 360 view of the
prototype

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
prototype

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.080 
prototype
alright<00:01:59.260> so<00:01:59.440> as<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.800> guys<00:01:59.950> can<00:02:00.280> see<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.820> kind

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
alright so as you guys can see it kind

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.000 
alright so as you guys can see it kind
of<00:02:01.150> looks<00:02:01.360> like<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.690> one<00:02:01.960> on<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> bottom<00:02:02.470> it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
of looks like this one on the bottom it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.880 
of looks like this one on the bottom it
is<00:02:03.550> two<00:02:04.000> different<00:02:04.420> separate<00:02:04.780> pieces<00:02:05.080> as<00:02:05.650> if

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
is two different separate pieces as if

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.309 
is two different separate pieces as if
they<00:02:06.430> printed<00:02:07.000> both<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.540> these<00:02:07.630> separate<00:02:08.170> and

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
they printed both of these separate and

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.229 
they printed both of these separate and
then<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.679> piece<00:02:08.860> them<00:02:09.069> together

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
then just piece them together

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.209 
then just piece them together
I<00:02:10.330> was<00:02:10.989> doing<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.440> little<00:02:11.530> bit<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.830> research

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.219 
I was doing a little bit of research

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.880 
I was doing a little bit of research
into<00:02:12.640> 3d<00:02:12.999> printing<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:14.230> models<00:02:14.709> that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
into 3d printing and the models that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
into 3d printing and the models that
come<00:02:15.099> out<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.760> three

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
come out of the three

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
come out of the three
the<00:02:16.200> printer<00:02:16.590> look<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:17.010> lot<00:02:17.400> different<00:02:17.940> than

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the printer look a lot different than

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.090 
the printer look a lot different than
this<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:18.990> can<00:02:19.200> tell<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.560> was<00:02:19.770> actually

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
this so I can tell this was actually

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.760 
this so I can tell this was actually
probably<00:02:20.610> Nintendo's<00:02:21.450> doing<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.200> printing

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
probably Nintendo's doing of printing

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.530 
probably Nintendo's doing of printing
these<00:02:22.920> off<00:02:23.310> because<00:02:23.640> they<00:02:23.910> are<00:02:24.030> basically

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
these off because they are basically

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.380 
these off because they are basically
almost<00:02:25.230> identical<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.730> finalized

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
almost identical to the finalized

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.620 
almost identical to the finalized
product<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.170> was<00:02:28.320> sold<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.770> Target<00:02:29.460> now<00:02:30.420> with

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
product that was sold in Target now with

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.840 
product that was sold in Target now with
this<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.110> noticed<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.040> quality<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
this one I noticed the quality of the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.400 
this one I noticed the quality of the
hair<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> top<00:02:33.360> feels<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.050> little<00:02:34.170> bit

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
hair on the top feels a little bit

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.270 
hair on the top feels a little bit
different<00:02:34.950> than<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.850> final<00:02:36.360> product<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
different than the final product the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.580 
different than the final product the
feet<00:02:38.280> might<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> little<00:02:39.210> bit<00:02:39.540> larger<00:02:40.320> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
feet might be a little bit larger just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.730 
feet might be a little bit larger just
by<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> hair<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.360> noticeable<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
by a hair but not noticeable to the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
by a hair but not noticeable to the
naked<00:02:43.950> eye<00:02:45.110> but<00:02:46.110> as<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.800> see<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.460> ears

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
naked eye but as you can see the ears

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.090 
naked eye but as you can see the ears
were<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.210> painted<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.770> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
were not painted in on this one and the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.720 
were not painted in on this one and the
arm<00:02:50.390> wear<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.230> regular<00:02:52.620> prototype<00:02:53.160> or<00:02:53.520> not

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
arm wear on the regular prototype or not

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.220 
arm wear on the regular prototype or not
the<00:02:53.820> regular<00:02:54.150> prototype<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> regular

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the regular prototype but the regular

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.620 
the regular prototype but the regular
amiibo<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.100> placed<00:02:56.490> in<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.850> little<00:02:57.180> bit<00:02:57.300> higher

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
amiibo is placed in a little bit higher

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.360 
amiibo is placed in a little bit higher
position<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:58.890> gonna<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.160> ahead<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
position so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
position so I'm gonna go ahead and
switch<00:02:59.670> these<00:02:59.910> out<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.510> kind<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.780> get

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
switch these out so you can kind of get

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.890 
switch these out so you can kind of get
a<00:03:00.980> 360<00:03:01.980> view<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.520> what<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.209> final<00:03:03.540> product

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
a 360 view of what the final product

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.290 
a 360 view of what the final product
actually<00:03:04.230> looks<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> stores<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.060> as

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
actually looks like in the stores so as

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.960 
actually looks like in the stores so as
you<00:03:06.480> may<00:03:06.660> notice<00:03:07.080> there<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> complete<00:03:08.580> shade

you may notice there is a complete shade
of<00:03:09.150> pink<00:03:09.390> instead<00:03:10.020> of<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.770> really<00:03:11.220> dark<00:03:11.610> or

of pink instead of that really dark or
deeper<00:03:13.200> pink<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.770> was<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.190> bottom<00:03:14.370> of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
deeper pink that was on the bottom of

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.020 
deeper pink that was on the bottom of
the<00:03:14.940> amiibo<00:03:15.720> also<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.950> black<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> ears

I<00:03:53.400> hope<00:03:53.940> people<00:03:54.209> see<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.750> as<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> black<00:03:55.560> peach

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
I hope people see this as a black peach

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.270 
I hope people see this as a black peach
but<00:03:57.720> if<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.200> can't<00:03:58.500> see<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.100> looks

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
but if you can't see that and it looks

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.460 
but if you can't see that and it looks
blue<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.820> don't<00:04:00.030> know<00:04:00.300> but<00:04:01.260> basically

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
blue to you I don't know but basically

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.550 
blue to you I don't know but basically
to<00:04:02.010> compare<00:04:02.910> these<00:04:03.090> two<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.630> was<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> big

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
to compare these two it was a big

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.490 
to compare these two it was a big
difference<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.870> noticeable<00:04:06.870> differences

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
difference in the noticeable differences

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.640 
difference in the noticeable differences
at<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:08.060> one<00:04:09.060> thing<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:09.720> sure<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.989> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
at that one thing is for sure that the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.680 
at that one thing is for sure that the
black<00:04:11.040> peach<00:04:11.550> that<00:04:11.580> they<00:04:11.970> started<00:04:12.330> with<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.660> a

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
black peach that they started with is a

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.099 
black peach that they started with is a
little<00:04:13.230> bit<00:04:13.380> larger<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.880> compared<00:04:15.630> these<00:04:15.810> on

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
little bit larger I compared these on

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.949 
little bit larger I compared these on
multiple<00:04:16.680> times<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.430> got<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> ruler<00:04:18.209> out<00:04:18.269> there<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
multiple times I got a ruler out there a

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.140 
multiple times I got a ruler out there a
little<00:04:19.350> bit<00:04:19.500> larger<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.400> crown<00:04:20.729> actually

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
little bit larger the crown actually

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.240 
little bit larger the crown actually
reaches<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> higher<00:04:21.780> level<00:04:22.109> on<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.680> left<00:04:23.010> hand

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
reaches a higher level on the left hand

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.790 
reaches a higher level on the left hand
peach<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.850> this<00:04:24.180> video<00:04:24.479> then<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.260> does<00:04:25.410> on<00:04:25.620> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
peach in this video then it does on the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.310 
peach in this video then it does on the
the<00:04:26.190> finalized<00:04:26.729> version<00:04:26.910> on<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.539> right<00:04:27.720> one

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
the finalized version on the right one

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.220 
the finalized version on the right one
thing<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.560> noticed

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
thing I noticed

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.170 
thing I noticed
the<00:04:29.530> hair<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:30.040> also<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.640> little<00:04:30.880> bit<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.090> a

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
the hair is also in a little bit of a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.330 
the hair is also in a little bit of a
different<00:04:31.510> position<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:32.560> if<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.800> take<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.010> look

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
different position so if you take a look

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.490 
different position so if you take a look
at<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.820> difference<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.600> size<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:35.230> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
at the difference in the size of the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.940 
at the difference in the size of the
head<00:04:35.910> in<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.030> back<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.960> she<00:04:38.350> has<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.500> couple

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
head in the back the she has a couple

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.180 
head in the back the she has a couple
more<00:04:38.980> actual<00:04:39.880> hair<00:04:40.750> follicles<00:04:41.440> coming<00:04:41.740> out<00:04:41.920> of

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
more actual hair follicles coming out of

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.360 
more actual hair follicles coming out of
the<00:04:42.430> back<00:04:42.730> of<00:04:42.910> her<00:04:43.030> head<00:04:43.980> standing<00:04:44.980> them<00:04:45.130> side

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
the back of her head standing them side

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.000 
the back of her head standing them side
by<00:04:45.400> side<00:04:45.580> I<00:04:45.880> do<00:04:46.150> notice<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.990> few<00:04:47.500> other<00:04:47.710> things

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
by side I do notice a few other things

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.730 
by side I do notice a few other things
that<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.700> detail<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.420> no<00:04:49.660> longer<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.380> the

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
that the detail is no longer on the

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.620 
that the detail is no longer on the
dress<00:04:51.100> that's<00:04:51.400> probably<00:04:51.910> because<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.480> hasn't

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
dress that's probably because it hasn't

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.350 
dress that's probably because it hasn't
been<00:04:52.930> painted<00:04:53.200> yet<00:04:53.500> one<00:04:54.490> major<00:04:54.790> thing<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:55.330> I

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
been painted yet one major thing that I

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.330 
been painted yet one major thing that I
noticed<00:04:55.810> on<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.140> base<00:04:56.350> of<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.680> black<00:04:56.950> one<00:04:57.190> it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
noticed on the base of the black one it

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.160 
noticed on the base of the black one it
kind<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.610> looked<00:04:57.850> like<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.210> was<00:04:58.360> spray-painted

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
kind of looked like it was spray-painted

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.750 
kind of looked like it was spray-painted
because<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.620> was<00:04:59.740> chipping<00:05:00.070> off<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.670> there

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
because it was chipping off and there

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.450 
because it was chipping off and there
was<00:05:00.880> gold<00:05:01.240> underneath<00:05:02.040> but<00:05:03.040> if<00:05:03.130> we<00:05:03.250> take<00:05:03.400> a

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
was gold underneath but if we take a

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.700 
was gold underneath but if we take a
look<00:05:03.610> at<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.820> bottom<00:05:04.150> there<00:05:04.720> are<00:05:04.870> no<00:05:05.170> markings

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
look at the bottom there are no markings

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.220 
look at the bottom there are no markings
on<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.340> bottom<00:05:06.700> of<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.120> left-hand<00:05:07.450> peach<00:05:07.780> but

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
on the bottom of the left-hand peach but

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.570 
on the bottom of the left-hand peach but
that<00:05:08.410> might<00:05:08.680> just<00:05:08.980> be<00:05:09.010> because<00:05:09.130> they<00:05:09.520> were

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
that might just be because they were

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.640 
that might just be because they were
spray-painted<00:05:09.940> over<00:05:10.390> but<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.080> still<00:05:11.410> couldn't

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
spray-painted over but I still couldn't

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.310 
spray-painted over but I still couldn't
feel<00:05:11.950> anything<00:05:12.220> when<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:12.880> rub<00:05:13.540> my<00:05:13.750> finger<00:05:14.170> over

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
feel anything when I rub my finger over

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.530 
feel anything when I rub my finger over
the<00:05:14.530> top<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.890> it<00:05:15.040> so<00:05:15.670> there<00:05:15.850> was<00:05:15.940> no<00:05:16.060> serial

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
the top of it so there was no serial

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.530 
the top of it so there was no serial
number<00:05:16.870> no<00:05:16.900> amiibo<00:05:17.860> logo<00:05:18.310> no<00:05:18.670> nothing<00:05:19.090> on<00:05:19.330> the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
number no amiibo logo no nothing on the

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.950 
number no amiibo logo no nothing on the
one<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.650> black<00:05:21.070> amiibo<00:05:21.700> prototype<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.510> only

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
one the black amiibo prototype the only

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.710 
one the black amiibo prototype the only
other<00:05:23.140> thing<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.800> was<00:05:24.700> noticeable<00:05:25.330> was<00:05:25.540> her

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
other thing that was noticeable was her

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.040 
other thing that was noticeable was her
ring<00:05:26.020> was<00:05:26.350> missing<00:05:26.590> on<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.610> left<00:05:28.030> hand<00:05:28.330> so

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
ring was missing on the left hand so

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.930 
ring was missing on the left hand so
that<00:05:29.080> was<00:05:29.380> something<00:05:29.770> else<00:05:29.920> that<00:05:30.070> was<00:05:30.430> not<00:05:30.670> I

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
that was something else that was not I

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.840 
that was something else that was not I
guess<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:32.200> think<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.980> was<00:05:33.100> probably<00:05:33.310> thought

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
guess I think that was probably thought

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.050 
guess I think that was probably thought
of<00:05:34.030> after<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:35.500> amiibo<00:05:36.130> prototype<00:05:36.730> was

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
of after the amiibo prototype was

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.370 
of after the amiibo prototype was
printed<00:05:37.450> up

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
printed up

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.890 
printed up
however<00:05:39.310> they<00:05:39.550> printed<00:05:39.850> it<00:05:39.940> also<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.390> noticed

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
however they printed it also I noticed

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.400 
however they printed it also I noticed
in<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.460> inside<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.790> black<00:05:43.060> one<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.930> was

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
in the inside of the black one it was

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.150 
in the inside of the black one it was
really<00:05:45.070> done<00:05:45.790> very<00:05:46.150> well<00:05:46.240> there<00:05:46.870> was<00:05:46.990> no<00:05:47.320> there

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
really done very well there was no there

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.540 
really done very well there was no there
was<00:05:48.220> no<00:05:48.520> like<00:05:49.500> dripping<00:05:50.500> paint<00:05:50.800> or<00:05:51.130> it's<00:05:51.280> hard

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
was no like dripping paint or it's hard

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.860 
was no like dripping paint or it's hard
to<00:05:51.640> kind<00:05:51.820> of<00:05:51.880> explain<00:05:52.210> but<00:05:52.390> there<00:05:52.510> wasn't<00:05:52.630> like

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
to kind of explain but there wasn't like

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.410 
to kind of explain but there wasn't like
it's<00:05:53.170> it<00:05:53.440> it's<00:05:53.800> black<00:05:54.100> guys<00:05:54.370> there's<00:05:54.670> no<00:05:54.940> doubt

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
it's it it's black guys there's no doubt

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.100 
it's it it's black guys there's no doubt
about<00:05:55.600> it

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
about it

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.690 
about it
this<00:05:56.470> was<00:05:56.680> not<00:05:56.860> just<00:05:56.890> something<00:05:57.520> that

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
this was not just something that

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.540 
this was not just something that
somebody<00:05:58.300> printed<00:05:59.230> up<00:05:59.410> and<00:05:59.590> then<00:05:59.800> spray

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
somebody printed up and then spray

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.400 
somebody printed up and then spray
painted<00:06:00.940> black<00:06:01.150> this<00:06:01.390> is<00:06:01.660> made<00:06:02.410> to<00:06:02.950> be<00:06:03.100> black

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
painted black this is made to be black

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.080 
painted black this is made to be black
but<00:06:05.410> other<00:06:05.590> than<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.190> details<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.880> lot<00:06:07.030> of

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
but other than that the details a lot of

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.820 
but other than that the details a lot of
the<00:06:07.180> details<00:06:07.600> are<00:06:07.750> still<00:06:07.840> there<00:06:08.200> like<00:06:08.230> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
the details are still there like the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.490 
the details are still there like the
dress<00:06:09.160> you<00:06:09.340> can<00:06:09.490> see<00:06:09.520> her<00:06:10.030> design<00:06:10.480> is<00:06:10.870> still

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
dress you can see her design is still

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.400 
dress you can see her design is still
there<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:13.150> different<00:06:13.510> layering<00:06:13.780> for<00:06:14.320> the

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
there the different layering for the

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.380 
there the different layering for the
dress<00:06:14.650> is<00:06:14.830> still<00:06:15.070> there<00:06:15.310> it's<00:06:15.580> just<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.060> think

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
dress is still there it's just I think

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.340 
dress is still there it's just I think
these<00:06:17.080> were<00:06:17.440> probably<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:19.270> first<00:06:19.750> couple<00:06:20.260> of

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
these were probably the first couple of

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.870 
these were probably the first couple of
ones<00:06:20.590> they<00:06:20.770> printed<00:06:21.130> off<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.460> see<00:06:21.640> if<00:06:21.730> they

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
ones they printed off to see if they

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.930 
ones they printed off to see if they
even<00:06:21.910> wanted<00:06:22.690> to<00:06:22.840> make<00:06:23.080> this<00:06:23.320> figure<00:06:23.770> in<00:06:24.700> this

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
even wanted to make this figure in this

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.760 
even wanted to make this figure in this
design<00:06:25.390> whoever<00:06:25.870> designed<00:06:26.260> this<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.590> don't

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
design whoever designed this I don't

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.820 
design whoever designed this I don't
really<00:06:26.890> know<00:06:27.420> but<00:06:28.420> basically<00:06:28.930> guys<00:06:29.470> these

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
really know but basically guys these

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.590 
really know but basically guys these
prototypes<00:06:30.430> are<00:06:30.610> real<00:06:30.820> I've<00:06:31.060> come<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.450> that

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
prototypes are real I've come to that

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.200 
prototypes are real I've come to that
conclusion<00:06:31.720> and<00:06:32.460> I'm<00:06:33.460> just<00:06:33.760> gonna<00:06:33.850> show<00:06:34.120> you

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
conclusion and I'm just gonna show you

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.600 
conclusion and I'm just gonna show you
guys<00:06:34.240> one<00:06:34.930> more<00:06:35.110> look<00:06:35.410> at<00:06:35.590> them<00:06:36.010> side<00:06:36.370> by<00:06:36.400> side

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
guys one more look at them side by side

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.880 
guys one more look at them side by side
so<00:06:36.940> you<00:06:37.240> can<00:06:37.420> kind<00:06:37.660> of<00:06:37.690> see<00:06:37.840> the<00:06:37.960> comparison<00:06:38.680> of

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890 
so you can kind of see the comparison of

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.090 
so you can kind of see the comparison of
all<00:06:39.790> of<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.240> amiibos<00:06:40.780> versus<00:06:41.470> the

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
all of the amiibos versus the

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.840 
all of the amiibos versus the
the<00:06:42.190> prototype<00:06:43.210> amiibos<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.960> were<00:06:44.080> first

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
the prototype amiibos that were first

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.480 
the prototype amiibos that were first
conceptualized<00:06:45.850> and<00:06:46.470> then<00:06:47.470> printed<00:06:47.980> off<00:06:48.130> to

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
conceptualized and then printed off to

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.400 
conceptualized and then printed off to
make<00:06:49.000> what<00:06:49.480> they<00:06:49.630> actually<00:06:49.780> look<00:06:49.960> like<00:06:50.110> today

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
make what they actually look like today

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.290 
make what they actually look like today
so<00:06:51.220> I<00:06:51.250> want<00:06:51.460> to<00:06:51.490> thank<00:06:51.700> you<00:06:51.790> guys<00:06:51.820> for<00:06:52.000> watching
