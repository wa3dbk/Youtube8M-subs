ops<00:00:35.160> 2<00:00:35.309> perk<00:00:35.640> nalysis<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.600> perfect

ops 2 perk nalysis on the perfect

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.979 
ops 2 perk nalysis on the perfect
toughness<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.239> basically<00:00:39.239> toughness<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
toughness and basically toughness is a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.389 
toughness and basically toughness is a
perk<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.649> people<00:00:40.739> talk<00:00:40.980> about<00:00:41.010> saying

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
perk that a lot people talk about saying

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
perk that a lot people talk about saying
it's<00:00:41.579> very<00:00:41.870> useless<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> believe<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's very useless but I believe it's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
it's very useless but I believe it's
very<00:00:43.890> useful<00:00:44.270> just<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:45.899> some

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
very useful just because there's some

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.510 
very useful just because there's some
things<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.410> might<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.309> perk

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
things you might not know about the perk

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.470 
things you might not know about the perk
and<00:00:49.129> lot<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.190> people<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.210> use<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and lot of people don't like to use this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
and lot of people don't like to use this
park<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.079> very<00:00:52.260> useful<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

on the screen right now you guys see a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.090 
on the screen right now you guys see a
slow<00:01:03.449> mode<00:01:03.600> version<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.170> me<00:01:04.799> getting<00:01:05.010> shot

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
slow mode version of me getting shot

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
slow mode version of me getting shot
with<00:01:06.000> toughness<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> min<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
with toughness you see me a min the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
with toughness you see me a min the
flinches<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.890> barely<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.780> does<00:01:09.780> exactly

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
flinches just barely just does exactly

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130

what<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> says<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> obviously<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> perk<00:01:12.960> does

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
what it says so obviously the perk does

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.210 
what it says so obviously the perk does

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
work so now on the screen is a stumbled

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100 
work so now on the screen is a stumbled
version<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:18.270> having<00:01:18.450> toughness<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
version of not having toughness on you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.399 
version of not having toughness on you
see<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.130> shot<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.030> flinch<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
see when you get shot that you flinch it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
see when you get shot that you flinch it
goes<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> side<00:01:23.430> that'll

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
goes all the way to the side that'll

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
goes all the way to the side that'll
mess<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.450> aim<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.159> start

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

going<00:01:26.700> everywhere<00:01:27.200> um<00:01:28.200> now<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> screen

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going everywhere um now on the screen

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.789 
going everywhere um now on the screen
you'll<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.210> compared<00:01:30.710> version<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you'll see a just compared version of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.240 
you'll see a just compared version of
the<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.369> its<00:01:32.909> maximum<00:01:33.439> um<00:01:34.439> sway<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> guess

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the two at its maximum um sway I guess

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.060 
the two at its maximum um sway I guess
when<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.640> shot<00:01:36.060> um<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:37.350> outline<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
when you get shot um the outline one is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.670 
when you get shot um the outline one is
the<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.700> toughness<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.530> just<00:01:40.530> take

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the one with toughness on and just take

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.240 
the one with toughness on and just take
a<00:01:40.710> quick<00:01:40.890> look<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
a quick look at that

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.240 
a quick look at that
and<00:01:43.240> now<00:01:43.570> guys<00:01:43.780> obviously<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.560> summary<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.040> what

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
and now guys obviously a summary of what

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.240
