also the four-leaf clover on her fridge
it's<00:02:44.610> actually<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.480> old<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.500> green

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it's actually so old now that the green

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.160 
it's actually so old now that the green
pigment<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.000> four-leaf<00:02:48.420> clover<00:02:48.750> actually

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
pigment in the four-leaf clover actually

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.050 
pigment in the four-leaf clover actually
disintegrated<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.459> pretty<00:02:50.640> much<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
disintegrated so it's pretty much a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.030 
disintegrated so it's pretty much a
black<00:02:51.390> four-leaf<00:02:51.870> clover<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.620> looks<00:02:52.799> really

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
white it's not really old it's just the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.490 
white it's not really old it's just the
fact<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.060> lost<00:02:57.239> its<00:02:57.450> coloring<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.110> you'll

carried over obviously I was lucky that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.879 
carried over obviously I was lucky that
day<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.079> made<00:03:46.230> five<00:03:46.440> dollars<00:03:46.769> so

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
easily but I like to think that I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.970 
easily but I like to think that I
carried<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:49.109> with<00:03:49.260> me<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.530> life<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.920> my
