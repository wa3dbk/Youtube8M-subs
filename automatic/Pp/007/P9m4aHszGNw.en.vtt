a this is a question that comes up quite

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.160 
a this is a question that comes up quite
a<00:00:11.770> bit<00:00:12.130> and<00:00:12.400> it's<00:00:13.000> for<00:00:13.420> people<00:00:13.900> that<00:00:14.050> are

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
a bit and it's for people that are

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.260 
a bit and it's for people that are
learning<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.740> use<00:00:14.769> a<00:00:14.920> router<00:00:15.280> that's<00:00:15.670> that's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
learning to use a router that's that's

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.170 
learning to use a router that's that's
what<00:00:16.450> this<00:00:16.570> is<00:00:16.630> here<00:00:16.810> they<00:00:17.590> don't<00:00:17.950> quite<00:00:18.730> know

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
what this is here they don't quite know

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.839 
what this is here they don't quite know
because<00:00:19.689> it<00:00:19.810> can<00:00:19.960> be<00:00:20.110> confusing<00:00:20.849> which

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
because it can be confusing which

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.499 
because it can be confusing which
direction<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:23.079> move<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:24.040> router<00:00:24.279> in<00:00:24.820> now

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
direction to move the router in now

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.780 
direction to move the router in now
here's<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.960> thing<00:00:26.200> there's<00:00:26.529> two<00:00:26.790> different

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
here's the thing there's two different

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.300 
here's the thing there's two different
kinds<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.570> cuts<00:00:28.930> there's<00:00:29.590> what's<00:00:29.829> called<00:00:30.009> a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
kinds of cuts there's what's called a

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.700 
kinds of cuts there's what's called a
push<00:00:30.820> cut<00:00:31.149> now<00:00:31.660> that's<00:00:31.899> what<00:00:32.349> I'm<00:00:32.470> going<00:00:32.649> to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
push cut now that's what I'm going to

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.380 
push cut now that's what I'm going to
show<00:00:32.980> you<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.790> there's<00:00:33.940> something<00:00:34.180> else

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
show you and there's something else

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.280 
show you and there's something else
called<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:35.160> climbing<00:00:36.160> cut<00:00:36.460> now<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.390> push<00:00:37.720> cut<00:00:38.050> is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
called a climbing cut now a push cut is

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.310 
called a climbing cut now a push cut is
the<00:00:38.430> safer<00:00:39.430> of<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.640> two<00:00:39.880> and<00:00:40.240> so<00:00:40.780> you're

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
the safer of the two and so you're

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.250 
the safer of the two and so you're
learning<00:00:41.830> how<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.250> do<00:00:42.550> woodworking<00:00:43.510> and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
learning how to do woodworking and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.950 
learning how to do woodworking and
you're<00:00:44.380> learning<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:45.310> router<00:00:45.700> okay<00:00:46.390> let<00:00:46.870> us

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
you're learning the router okay let us

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.880 
you're learning the router okay let us
stick<00:00:47.140> with<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.290> push<00:00:47.620> cut<00:00:47.950> a<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.930> experienced

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
stick with a push cut a more experienced

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.480 
stick with a push cut a more experienced
woodworker<00:00:51.900> might<00:00:52.900> want<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.320> use<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.860> climbing

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
woodworker might want to use a climbing

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.770 
woodworker might want to use a climbing
cut<00:00:54.700> because<00:00:54.880> there<00:00:55.030> are<00:00:55.090> some<00:00:55.210> instances

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
cut because there are some instances

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.080 
cut because there are some instances
when<00:00:56.200> you<00:00:56.320> use<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.530> climbing<00:00:57.040> cut<00:00:57.280> okay<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:57.910> what

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
when you use a climbing cut okay so what

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.340 
when you use a climbing cut okay so what
we're<00:00:58.180> going<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.329> do<00:00:58.480> is<00:00:58.600> going<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.780> bring<00:00:59.110> in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
we're going to do is going to bring in

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.040 
we're going to do is going to bring in

close and I'm going to show you exactly
what<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.770> push<00:01:03.160> cut<00:01:03.550> should<00:01:04.210> look<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:04.570> now

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
what a push cut should look like now

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.899 
what a push cut should look like now
what<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.829> in<00:01:05.979> here<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.220> it's<00:01:06.579> called<00:01:06.759> a

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
what I have in here is it's called a

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.480 
what I have in here is it's called a
round<00:01:07.119> over<00:01:07.509> bit<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.799> way<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.009> can<00:01:09.249> know

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
round over bit and the way you can know

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.499 
round over bit and the way you can know
that<00:01:09.700> you're<00:01:09.819> going<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.240> right<00:01:10.329> direction

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
that you're going in the right direction

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.209 
that you're going in the right direction
is<00:01:11.109> the<00:01:11.770> bit<00:01:12.069> will<00:01:12.520> be<00:01:12.780> rotating<00:01:13.780> away<00:01:14.219> from

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
is the bit will be rotating away from

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.910 
is the bit will be rotating away from
the<00:01:15.399> wood<00:01:16.109> so<00:01:17.109> what<00:01:17.469> I'm<00:01:17.560> going<00:01:17.679> to<00:01:17.710> do<00:01:17.829> is

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
the wood so what I'm going to do is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.399 
the wood so what I'm going to do is
going<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.100> turn<00:01:18.249> on<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.609> router<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.780> then<00:01:20.259> I'm

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
going to turn on the router and then I'm

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.800 
going to turn on the router and then I'm
going<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.590> turn<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.859> off<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:21.039> you<00:01:21.249> can<00:01:21.579> see<00:01:22.030> what

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
going to turn it off so you can see what

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.039 
going to turn it off so you can see what
direction<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.469> blade<00:01:23.710> is<00:01:23.859> moving

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.570 

now<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> cut

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
now I'm going to make the cut

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.969 
now I'm going to make the cut
I've<00:01:32.850> got<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.180> router<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.200> wood<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.830> I'm

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I've got my router off the wood and I'm

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.440 
I've got my router off the wood and I'm
going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> start<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> router<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.330> I'm

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
going to start the router and then I'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:50.899 
going to start the router and then I'm
going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> come<00:01:36.840> in

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.430 

okay<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:51.970> maybe<00:01:52.240> you're<00:01:52.420> thinking<00:01:52.600> whoa<00:01:52.870> wait

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
okay so maybe you're thinking whoa wait

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.930 
okay so maybe you're thinking whoa wait
a<00:01:53.590> second<00:01:53.890> Lee<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.010> got<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.400> turn<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.820> router

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
a second Lee I got to turn on the router

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.410 
a second Lee I got to turn on the router
every<00:01:55.780> time<00:01:56.050> I<00:01:56.500> want<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.610> figure<00:01:58.030> out<00:01:58.180> which

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
every time I want to figure out which

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.870 
every time I want to figure out which
way<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.930> blade<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.560> rotating<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.400> I'll<00:02:00.670> know

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
way the blade is rotating so I'll know

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.240 
way the blade is rotating so I'll know
when<00:02:01.119> I'm<00:02:01.240> doing<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.690> push<00:02:01.900> cut<00:02:02.140> no<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.070> don't

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
when I'm doing a push cut no you don't

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.770 
when I'm doing a push cut no you don't
have<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:03.970> there's<00:02:04.180> another<00:02:04.390> trick

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
have to do that there's another trick

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.150 
have to do that there's another trick
and<00:02:05.380> what<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:07.060> want<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.990> push<00:02:08.470> four

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
and what it is is you want to push four

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.850 
and what it is is you want to push four

want to go clockwise to the piece I hope

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.290 
want to go clockwise to the piece I hope
that<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.709> clears<00:03:18.069> up<00:03:18.280> any<00:03:18.519> confusion<00:03:19.180> that
