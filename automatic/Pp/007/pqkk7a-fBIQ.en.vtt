be adding a few of these dots these are

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.609 
be adding a few of these dots these are
liquid<00:01:33.360> dots<00:01:33.840> they<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.470> like

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
liquid dots they kind of look like

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.679 
liquid dots they kind of look like
pearls<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.340> dry<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.090> an<00:01:36.299> optional

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
pearls when they dry this is an optional

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.330 
pearls when they dry this is an optional
step<00:01:36.869> obviously<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.920> longer<00:01:38.130> if

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
step obviously this will take longer if

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
step obviously this will take longer if
you<00:01:38.369> decide<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.970> these<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.750> like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you decide to do these but I really like

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.120

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
this is an excellent glue to be using

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.499 
this is an excellent glue to be using
because<00:05:35.159> it's<00:05:35.310> acid-free<00:05:35.789> so<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.210> doesn't<00:05:36.419> eat

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
because it's acid-free so it doesn't eat

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.240 
because it's acid-free so it doesn't eat
through<00:05:36.689> the<00:05:36.719> paper<00:05:36.960> eventually<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:37.979> people

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
through the paper eventually so people

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.909 
through the paper eventually so people
can<00:05:38.370> save<00:05:38.550> them<00:05:38.729> and<00:05:39.050> also<00:05:40.050> because<00:05:40.409> it's<00:05:40.710> got

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
can save them and also because it's got

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.790 
can save them and also because it's got
a<00:05:40.949> really<00:05:41.129> strong<00:05:41.400> bond<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:42.229> I<00:05:43.229> put<00:05:43.409> on<00:05:43.590> my

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
a really strong bond and I put on my

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.050 
a really strong bond and I put on my
rhinestones<00:05:44.280> just<00:05:44.550> as<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:44.729> did<00:05:44.879> in<00:05:44.969> the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060

rhinestones just as I did in the
previous<00:05:45.210> card<00:05:45.659> so<00:05:46.560> now<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.740> have<00:05:46.919> something

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
