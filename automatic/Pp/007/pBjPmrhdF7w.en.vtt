wheels<00:02:22.380> will<00:02:22.770> start<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.280> go<00:02:23.430> around<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:25.260> back

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
wheels will start to go around the back

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
wheels will start to go around the back
there<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.370> want<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.640> change<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
there now if you want to change in the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140 
there now if you want to change in the
speed<00:02:27.710> your<00:02:28.710> knocked-up<00:02:29.100> forward<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.030> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
speed your knocked-up forward and you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.450 
speed your knocked-up forward and you
can<00:02:30.330> hear<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.600> he's<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.800> faster<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
can hear that he's going faster and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.210 
can hear that he's going faster and
what's<00:02:32.730> cool<00:02:32.970> about<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:35.010> our

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
what's cool about it is we have our

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.490 
what's cool about it is we have our
lights<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.970> front<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:37.080> when<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.350> switch

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
lights on the front so when you switch

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.650 
lights on the front so when you switch
this<00:02:37.709> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.100> light<00:02:38.370> comes<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.510> would

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
this on the light comes on so that would

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.350 
this on the light comes on so that would
look<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:39.990> good<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.010> dark<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.520> then<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
look really good in the dark and then to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.330 
look really good in the dark and then to
deactivate<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.410> Train<00:02:43.680> all<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> need<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.250> do

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
deactivate the Train all you need to do

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.630 
deactivate the Train all you need to do
is<00:02:44.459> press<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.170> button<00:02:46.170> again<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:47.370> let's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
is press that button again but let's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.080 
is press that button again but let's
take<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.330> look<00:02:48.750> at<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.880> drawbridge<00:02:50.880> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
take a look at the drawbridge of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.660 
take a look at the drawbridge of
construction<00:02:51.780> first<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:52.709> I'll<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
construction first and then I'll get the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.970 
construction first and then I'll get the
track<00:02:54.150> back<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.660> table<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.290> we<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.650> see

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
track back on the table and we can see

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440 
track back on the table and we can see
the<00:02:56.100> train<00:02:56.370> going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.850> Raymond

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
the train going to Raymond

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.410 
the train going to Raymond
now<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.080> drawbridge<00:02:58.590> has<00:02:58.980> an<00:02:59.390> entry<00:03:00.390> point

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
now this drawbridge has an entry point

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.930 
now this drawbridge has an entry point
which<00:03:00.780> slopes<00:03:01.170> upwards<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> other

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
which slopes upwards and then the other

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940 
which slopes upwards and then the other
end<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.420> comes<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:03.780> again<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.560> can

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
end it comes down again so you can

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.060 
end it comes down again so you can
continue<00:03:05.640> your<00:03:05.820> truck<00:03:06.330> around<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:07.650> link

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
continue your truck around and then link

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.250 
continue your truck around and then link
it<00:03:08.220> back<00:03:08.430> up<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.880> other<00:03:09.090> side<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.050> your

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
it back up to the other side so your

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.590 
it back up to the other side so your
train<00:03:10.590> will<00:03:10.860> go<00:03:11.160> up<00:03:11.489> over<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.030> drawbridge

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
train will go up over the drawbridge

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.290 
train will go up over the drawbridge
which<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:14.070> activate<00:03:14.550> by<00:03:14.730> pushing<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
which you can activate by pushing the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.330 
which you can activate by pushing the
switch<00:03:15.630> down<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.590> then<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.920> comes<00:03:17.130> up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
switch down you can see then it comes up

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.760 
switch down you can see then it comes up
and<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.180> lock<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.290> push<00:03:19.560> it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
and you can lock it in if you push it

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.580 
and you can lock it in if you push it
across<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.270> bring<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.320> bit

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
across now if I bring this in a bit

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.190 
across now if I bring this in a bit
closer<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.820> see<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.750> what<00:03:24.959> this

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
closer you can see you know what this

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.100 
closer you can see you know what this
mantle<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.980> for<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> purposes<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.120> was<00:03:27.840> showing

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
mantle is for the purposes I was showing

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.050 
mantle is for the purposes I was showing
you<00:03:28.260> now<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.160> get<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.430> stand<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.970> just

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
you now there you get that stand it just

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
you now there you get that stand it just
does<00:03:30.390> go<00:03:30.600> together<00:03:30.780> very<00:03:30.989> easily<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.680> can

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
does go together very easily as you can

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.520 
does go together very easily as you can
see<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.190> slot<00:03:32.519> see<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.600> very<00:03:34.019> easy<00:03:34.380> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
see the slot see and it is very easy to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.699 
see the slot see and it is very easy to
construct<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.570> there<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.750> your<00:03:36.959> switch<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:37.650> if

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
construct and there is your switch so if

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.440 
construct and there is your switch so if
you<00:03:37.860> want<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> drawbridge<00:03:38.489> down<00:03:38.700> again<00:03:39.030> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
you want the drawbridge down again you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.090 
you want the drawbridge down again you
just<00:03:39.660> push<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:39.900> across<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.830> will<00:03:40.980> go

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
just push that across and it will go

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.500 
just push that across and it will go
down<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:41.910> want<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> hold<00:03:42.299> it

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
down but if you just want to hold it

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.840 
down but if you just want to hold it
manually<00:03:42.810> keep<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.769> in<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.040> position<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:44.700> if

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
manually keep it in that position but if

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.240 
manually keep it in that position but if
not<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.299> can<00:03:45.510> lock<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.830> will<00:03:46.920> stay

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
not you can lock it in and it will stay

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.979 
not you can lock it in and it will stay
there<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.489> at<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.030> part<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.510> does<00:03:48.660> come<00:03:48.870> up

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
there and at this part it does come up

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.380 
there and at this part it does come up
if<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:49.860> do<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.160> again<00:03:50.430> if<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.610> watch<00:03:51.090> that

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
if we do that again if you watch that

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.720 
if we do that again if you watch that
part<00:03:51.690> there<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.320> push<00:03:52.560> down<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:53.400> does<00:03:53.700> a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
part there as I push down that does a

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.180 
part there as I push down that does a
rise<00:03:54.090> up<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:55.230> will<00:03:55.380> stop<00:03:55.650> your<00:03:55.829> train

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
rise up and that will stop your train

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.699 
rise up and that will stop your train
from<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:56.970> over<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.360> drawbridge<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.440> once

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
from going over the drawbridge but once

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.170 
from going over the drawbridge but once
you<00:03:58.920> would<00:03:59.100> deactivate<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.850> drawbridge

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
you would deactivate the drawbridge

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.199 
you would deactivate the drawbridge
that's<00:04:00.900> well<00:04:01.260> then<00:04:01.500> sink<00:04:01.980> back<00:04:02.160> down<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.610> the

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
that's well then sink back down and the

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.289 
that's well then sink back down and the
train<00:04:03.630> will<00:04:04.019> carry<00:04:04.410> on<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.400> your

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
train will carry on but that is your

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.300 
train will carry on but that is your
drawbridge<00:04:06.690> assist<00:04:07.470> them<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> pretty<00:04:08.010> cool

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
drawbridge assist them a pretty cool

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.420 
drawbridge assist them a pretty cool
piece<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.720> set<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.200> from<00:04:10.650> what<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.220> do

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
piece of the set and from what you do

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.370 
piece of the set and from what you do
get<00:04:11.579> supplied<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.239> this<00:04:12.390> set<00:04:12.600> this<00:04:12.870> will<00:04:13.170> be

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
get supplied in this set this will be

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.240 
get supplied in this set this will be
the<00:04:13.590> centerpiece<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.640> your<00:04:14.959> truck<00:04:15.959> as<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.560> is

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the centerpiece of your truck as it is

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.009 
the centerpiece of your truck as it is
the<00:04:17.489> main<00:04:17.700> part<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.269> does<00:04:18.479> have<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.870> most

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
the main part and does have the most

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.860 
the main part and does have the most
functions<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.370> if<00:04:20.519> we<00:04:20.700> take<00:04:20.940> these<00:04:21.359> away<00:04:21.600> we

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
functions so if we take these away we

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.350 
functions so if we take these away we
can<00:04:22.049> get<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.350> track<00:04:22.890> back<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.880> let's<00:04:24.120> put

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
can get the track back in so let's put

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.870 
can get the track back in so let's put
the<00:04:24.630> tracker<00:04:25.110> down<00:04:25.410> another<00:04:25.830> site<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.700> a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
the tracker down another site is just a

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.690 
the tracker down another site is just a
circular<00:04:27.380> construction<00:04:28.380> as<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.340> would<00:04:29.550> be

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
circular construction as it would be

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.460 
circular construction as it would be
quite<00:04:29.910> difficult<00:04:30.240> with<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.990> limited<00:04:31.560> space

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
quite difficult with the limited space

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.470 
quite difficult with the limited space
and<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.980> these<00:04:33.160> do<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.730> clip<00:04:34.060> together<00:04:34.390> I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
and that these do just clip together I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.630 
and that these do just clip together I
will<00:04:34.660> show<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.230> now<00:04:35.410> on<00:04:35.740> each<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.520> your

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
will show you that now on each of your

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.730 
will show you that now on each of your
tracks<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.150> get<00:04:37.480> this<00:04:37.750> part<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.200> sticks<00:04:38.500> out

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
tracks you get this part that sticks out

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.620 
tracks you get this part that sticks out
and<00:04:39.010> then<00:04:39.640> you<00:04:39.730> get<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.030> part<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.420> is

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
and then you get that part that is

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.050 
and then you get that part that is
inverted<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:41.860> all<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.130> need<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.310> do<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:42.700> clip

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
inverted so all you need to do is clip

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.210 
inverted so all you need to do is clip
it<00:04:43.240> all<00:04:43.330> those<00:04:43.570> together<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.560> as<00:04:44.800> easy

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
it all those together and it is as easy

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.020 
it all those together and it is as easy
as<00:04:45.490> that

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
as that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.390 
as that
very<00:04:46.570> easy<00:04:46.930> construction<00:04:47.350> these<00:04:47.770> trucks<00:04:48.160> are

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
very easy construction these trucks are

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.780 
very easy construction these trucks are
plastic<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.330> let's<00:04:50.230> put<00:04:50.470> our<00:04:50.650> shrine<00:04:51.100> on<00:04:51.340> now

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
plastic and let's put our shrine on now

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.120 
plastic and let's put our shrine on now
because<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.360> circular<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.140> may<00:04:53.530> come

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
because it is circular it may come

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.790 
because it is circular it may come
crashing<00:04:54.670> off<00:04:54.850> as<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.210> has<00:04:55.450> been<00:04:55.750> known<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.440> do

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
crashing off as it has been known to do

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.840 
crashing off as it has been known to do
that<00:04:56.980> much<00:04:57.190> like<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.060> possibly<00:04:58.510> saw<00:04:59.550> as<00:05:00.550> we

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
that much like the possibly saw as we

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.510 
that much like the possibly saw as we
watch<00:05:01.540> agura<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.050> my<00:05:02.320> best<00:05:02.710> put<00:05:02.980> it<00:05:03.070> on<00:05:03.220> first

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
watch agura and my best put it on first

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.030 
watch agura and my best put it on first
and<00:05:03.790> then<00:05:03.940> press<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.360> button<00:05:04.660> so<00:05:05.530> there<00:05:05.830> we<00:05:06.010> go

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
and then press the button so there we go

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.300 
and then press the button so there we go
there<00:05:06.700> is<00:05:06.730> your<00:05:06.850> training<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.680> engine<00:05:09.130> in

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
there is your training the engine in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.000 
there is your training the engine in
action<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:09.910> he's<00:05:10.150> dead

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
action and he's dead

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.550 
action and he's dead
that's<00:05:12.010> because<00:05:12.730> the<00:05:13.360> truck<00:05:13.810> had<00:05:14.140> broken

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
that's because the truck had broken

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.980 
that's because the truck had broken
apart<00:05:14.880> but<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:15.970> can<00:05:16.150> actually<00:05:16.240> do<00:05:16.660> that<00:05:16.840> you

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
apart but you can actually do that you

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.170 
apart but you can actually do that you
can<00:05:17.200> break<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.710> truck<00:05:17.950> apart<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:19.000> you<00:05:19.150> can

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
can break the truck apart and you can

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.740 
can break the truck apart and you can
make<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.780> train<00:05:20.080> crash<00:05:20.440> if<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.460> want<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.970> if

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
make this train crash if you want to if

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.480 
make this train crash if you want to if
you<00:05:22.990> really<00:05:23.200> really<00:05:23.650> want<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.950> make<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.250> train

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
you really really want to make the train

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.600 
you really really want to make the train
crash<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:25.030> can't<00:05:25.390> evade<00:05:25.990> oh<00:05:26.290> now<00:05:26.950> she's<00:05:27.250> going

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
crash you can't evade oh now she's going

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.360 
crash you can't evade oh now she's going
around<00:05:27.730> happily<00:05:28.390> I'm<00:05:28.960> having<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.860> way<00:05:30.190> out

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
around happily I'm having a way out

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.910 
around happily I'm having a way out
other<00:05:30.520> side<00:05:30.820> and<00:05:31.540> as<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.690> say<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:31.990> logs<00:05:32.440> on<00:05:32.800> the

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
other side and as I say that logs on the

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.480 
other side and as I say that logs on the
front<00:05:33.190> is<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.910> very<00:05:34.540> nice<00:05:34.990> addition<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:36.340> the

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
front is a very nice addition and the

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.640 
front is a very nice addition and the
way<00:05:36.580> this<00:05:36.730> is<00:05:36.880> going<00:05:37.090> around<00:05:37.270> in<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:37.660> back<00:05:37.870> it

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
way this is going around in the back it

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.870 
way this is going around in the back it
looks<00:05:39.370> fantastic<00:05:39.610> now<00:05:40.500> let's<00:05:41.500> try<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.280> second

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
looks fantastic now let's try the second

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.600 
looks fantastic now let's try the second
speed<00:05:43.150> I<00:05:43.390> don't<00:05:43.780> think<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.740> will<00:05:44.860> stay<00:05:45.220> on<00:05:45.250> the

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
speed I don't think it will stay on the

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.370 
speed I don't think it will stay on the
truck<00:05:45.880> in<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.210> second<00:05:46.600> speed<00:05:46.810> because<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.200> is

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
truck in the second speed because it is

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.730 
truck in the second speed because it is
too<00:05:47.980> sharp<00:05:48.340> both<00:05:48.760> so<00:05:48.940> we<00:05:49.030> can<00:05:49.270> try<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.810> let's

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
too sharp both so we can try and let's

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.810 
too sharp both so we can try and let's
see<00:05:51.130> what<00:05:51.310> happens

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
see what happens

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.989 
see what happens
oh<00:05:52.770> yes<00:05:53.770> it's<00:05:54.250> staying<00:05:54.580> on<00:05:54.760> guys

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
oh yes it's staying on guys

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.949 
oh yes it's staying on guys
very<00:05:56.659> a<00:05:57.139> lot<00:05:57.319> because<00:05:57.499> the<00:05:57.949> wallflower<00:05:58.279> to<00:05:58.639> say
