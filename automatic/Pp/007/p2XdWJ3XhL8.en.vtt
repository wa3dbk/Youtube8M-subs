back on the bench press bar and here's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.060 
back on the bench press bar and here's
what<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> often<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.750> position<00:00:37.410> right

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
what I often see is this position right

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790 
what I often see is this position right
here<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:39.149> people<00:00:39.329> trying<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.899> push<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.469> bar

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

here I see people trying to push a bar
straight<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.300> shoulder

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
straight up this can be with shoulder

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.440 
straight up this can be with shoulder
pressing<00:00:43.050> too<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:44.040> their<00:00:44.250> fist<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.850> kind<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
pressing too but their fist is kind of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
pressing too but their fist is kind of
cocked<00:00:45.750> back<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.579> here's<00:00:47.879> why

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
cocked back like that now here's why

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630 
cocked back like that now here's why
that's<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> problem<00:00:48.559> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.800> take<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.100> fist

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that's a problem if you take your fist

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.240 
that's a problem if you take your fist
and<00:00:50.850> push<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> way<00:00:52.410> back<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and push it all the way back and you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.770 
and push it all the way back and you
continue<00:00:53.670> pushing<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.420> you've<00:00:54.570> basically

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
continue pushing what you've basically

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
continue pushing what you've basically
done<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.350> you've<00:00:55.680> created<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.399> same<00:00:56.610> joint

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
alignment as a jujitsu technique this is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.000 
alignment as a jujitsu technique this is
a<00:01:00.539> technique<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.199> use<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.559> take<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> man

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
a technique you can use to take a man

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.729 
a technique you can use to take a man
down<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> submission<00:01:03.120> hold<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.600> MMA<00:01:04.170> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
down this is a submission hold at MMA so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.740 
down this is a submission hold at MMA so
you<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.180> wrist<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.659> a

position that can cause that much

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.910 
position that can cause that much
discomfort<00:01:08.780> conversely<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
discomfort conversely this is not the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.730 
discomfort conversely this is not the
way<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> transfer<00:01:11.820> force<00:01:12.119> effectively

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
way to transfer force effectively

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.170 
way to transfer force effectively
