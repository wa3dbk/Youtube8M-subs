00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
of that extreme minimalism and trying to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.580

was<00:00:36.860> just<00:00:37.129> thinking<00:00:37.460> about<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.150> fact<00:00:38.300> that

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
was just thinking about the fact that

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.790 
was just thinking about the fact that
those<00:00:38.600> dresses<00:00:38.960> were<00:00:38.989> probably<00:00:39.260> like<00:00:39.470> wearing

water<00:00:40.070> I<00:00:43.300> felt<00:00:44.300> ref<00:00:44.449> Simmons<00:00:44.809> is<00:00:44.900> opening<00:00:45.350> up

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
water I felt ref Simmons is opening up

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.590 
water I felt ref Simmons is opening up
with<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.100> collection<00:00:46.430> for<00:00:46.820> Jill<00:00:47.000> Sam<00:00:47.239> I

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
with that collection for Jill Sam I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.750 
with that collection for Jill Sam I
thought<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.110> was<00:00:48.260> absolutely<00:00:48.530> remarkable<00:00:49.129> how

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
thought it was absolutely remarkable how

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.560 
thought it was absolutely remarkable how
he<00:00:49.820> managed<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.870> have<00:00:51.260> such<00:00:51.500> an<00:00:51.650> understated

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
he managed to have such an understated

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.939 
he managed to have such an understated
sensuality<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.720> sexiness<00:00:54.230> which<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.769> thought

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
sensuality and sexiness which I thought

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.410 
sensuality and sexiness which I thought
was<00:00:55.129> kind<00:00:55.430> of<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.610> first<00:00:55.790> time<00:00:55.970> he's<00:00:56.269> done

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
was kind of the first time he's done

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.750 
was kind of the first time he's done
that<00:00:56.600> we've<00:00:57.500> seen<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:58.010> little<00:00:58.129> flavor<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.640> the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
that we've seen a little flavor of the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.670 
that we've seen a little flavor of the
20s<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.329> other<00:00:59.449> collections<00:01:00.050> what<00:01:00.500> do<00:01:00.590> you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680

think<00:01:00.860> that's<00:01:01.010> all<00:01:01.160> about<00:01:01.219> we<00:01:01.730> haven't<00:01:02.059> turned

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
think that's all about we haven't turned

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.559 
but just right so you didn't feel like
you<00:01:58.250> know<00:01:58.640> out<00:01:58.819> of<00:01:58.940> balance<00:01:59.270> or<00:01:59.360> out<00:01:59.479> of

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
you know out of balance or out of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:00.700 
you know out of balance or out of
proportion

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
proportion

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.160 
proportion
what<00:02:01.670> do<00:02:01.760> you<00:02:01.850> think<00:02:02.120> their<00:02:02.299> movement<00:02:02.810> means

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
what do you think their movement means

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.050 
what do you think their movement means
the<00:02:03.530> fact<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:03.830> he's<00:02:04.040> gone<00:02:04.640> away<00:02:04.820> from

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
the fact that he's gone away from

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.460 
the fact that he's gone away from
construction<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:05.659> something<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.290> so

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
construction to something that is so

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.859 
construction to something that is so
loose<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.010> revealing<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.030> way<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.750> look

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
loose and revealing in a way if you look

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.300 
loose and revealing in a way if you look
at<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.140> clothes<00:02:09.319> itself<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.950> patterns

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
at it the clothes itself the patterns

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.890 
at it the clothes itself the patterns
are<00:02:10.670> almost<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> same<00:02:11.270> but<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
are almost the same but it's just the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.270 
are almost the same but it's just the
way<00:02:12.020> he<00:02:12.050> uses<00:02:12.380> fabric<00:02:12.680> now<00:02:12.800> which<00:02:12.950> makes<00:02:13.160> it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
way he uses fabric now which makes it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.620 
way he uses fabric now which makes it
different<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.000> could<00:02:14.150> see<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.330> was<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.480> big

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
different and I could see it was a big

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.150 
different and I could see it was a big
step<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.080> feels<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.590> something

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
step for you feels like something

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.650 
step for you feels like something
opening<00:02:16.490> out<00:02:16.610> yeah<00:02:17.000> absolutely<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.510> whole

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
opening out yeah absolutely the whole

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.340 
opening out yeah absolutely the whole
new<00:02:17.780> world<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.560> big<00:02:18.709> thing<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:18.890> expect
