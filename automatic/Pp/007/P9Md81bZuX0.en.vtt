magnets<00:03:29.860> where<00:03:30.370> Jeff<00:03:30.550> are<00:03:30.730> used<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.060> use<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
magnets where Jeff are used to use a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.449 
magnets where Jeff are used to use a
clip<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:32.319> gotta<00:03:32.590> break<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> clip<00:03:33.130> or<00:03:33.280> lost

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
clip and I gotta break the clip or lost

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:46.150 
clip and I gotta break the clip or lost
a<00:03:33.580> clip<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> nice<00:03:35.050> feature

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.590 

I've<00:03:47.160> always<00:03:47.400> been<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.670> bit<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.180> fan<00:03:48.390> of

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
I've always been a bit of a fan of

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.110 
I've always been a bit of a fan of
actually<00:03:49.020> putting<00:03:49.590> stuff<00:03:49.950> on<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> wings<00:03:50.520> when

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
actually putting stuff on the wings when

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.150 
actually putting stuff on the wings when
you<00:03:51.209> have<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.510> robot<00:03:51.810> mode<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:53.010> think

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
you have it in robot mode I just think

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:23.489 
you have it in robot mode I just think
it<00:03:53.250> looks<00:03:53.370> much<00:03:53.550> cooler

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:23.499 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.719 

as<00:04:24.499> you<00:04:24.650> can<00:04:24.800> see<00:04:24.949> this<00:04:25.099> is<00:04:25.249> the<00:04:25.280> gear<00:04:25.550> walk

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
as you can see this is the gear walk

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.640 
as you can see this is the gear walk
mode<00:04:25.999> I've<00:04:26.330> never<00:04:26.599> been<00:04:26.749> much<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.169> fan<00:04:27.409> for

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
mode I've never been much of a fan for

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.650 
mode I've never been much of a fan for
the<00:04:27.710> gear<00:04:27.949> walk<00:04:28.270> modes<00:04:30.129> for<00:04:31.129> them

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
the gear walk modes for them

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.850 
the gear walk modes for them
lovely

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.040 

so<00:04:36.550> gear<00:04:36.819> walk<00:04:36.969> is<00:04:37.120> one<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.330> those<00:04:37.449> great<00:04:37.659> words

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
so gear walk is one of those great words

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.580 
so gear walk is one of those great words
and<00:04:38.319> made<00:04:39.189> up<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.490> letters<00:04:39.639> ground<00:04:40.629> effect<00:04:41.379> of

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
and made up of letters ground effect of

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.279 
and made up of letters ground effect of
reinforcement<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.580> winged<00:04:43.050> armament<00:04:44.050> with

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
reinforcement of winged armament with

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.830 
reinforcement of winged armament with
locomotive<00:04:45.099> knee<00:04:45.310> joint<00:04:45.719> brilliant

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.570 

the<00:04:51.350> hardest<00:04:51.590> part<00:04:51.710> about<00:04:51.919> getting<00:04:52.130> gear<00:04:52.430> work

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
the hardest part about getting gear work

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.420 
the hardest part about getting gear work
is<00:04:52.760> actually<00:04:53.060> getting<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.300> decent<00:04:53.480> pose<00:04:53.900> and

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
is actually getting a decent pose and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.920 
is actually getting a decent pose and
the<00:04:55.430> legs<00:04:55.639> are<00:04:55.850> actually<00:04:56.120> locking<00:04:56.300> properly

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
the legs are actually locking properly

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.560 
the legs are actually locking properly
you<00:04:57.260> can<00:04:57.410> t<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.740> pop<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.580> nation<00:04:58.970> from

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
you can t to pop the nation from

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.230 
you can t to pop the nation from
underneath<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:01.100> just<00:05:01.340> nuts<00:05:01.610> action<00:05:01.970> there

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
underneath and just nuts action there

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.050 
underneath and just nuts action there
and<00:05:02.750> they<00:05:03.620> should<00:05:03.830> be<00:05:03.860> flush<00:05:04.220> with<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.580> actual

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
and they should be flush with the actual

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.120 
and they should be flush with the actual
work<00:05:05.449> part<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:07.150> plane<00:05:08.150> but<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:09.889> can't

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
work part of the plane but you can't

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.500 
work part of the plane but you can't
actually<00:05:10.310> cause<00:05:10.639> a<00:05:10.669> properly<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.300> front

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
actually cause a properly the front

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.939 
actually cause a properly the front
won't<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:11.900> then<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.470> doesn't<00:05:12.770> balance

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
won't it then and it doesn't balance

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.250 
won't it then and it doesn't balance
properly<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:14.120> can<00:05:14.360> see<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.600> kink<00:05:14.840> back<00:05:15.050> there

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
properly you can see the kink back there

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.500 
properly you can see the kink back there
just<00:05:15.590> about<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.010> skull<00:05:16.220> cap<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:17.540> look

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.839 

actually<00:05:23.570> entire<00:05:23.840> model<00:05:24.050> does

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:49.500 

look<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.419> wing

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.460 

there<00:05:49.990> we<00:05:50.080> go<00:05:50.200> pictured<00:05:50.620> on<00:05:50.800> very<00:05:51.190> handy
