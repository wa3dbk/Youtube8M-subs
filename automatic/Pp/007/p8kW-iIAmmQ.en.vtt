and to destroy all the zerg units i mean

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.369 
and to destroy all the zerg units i mean
you<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.260> base<00:00:40.590> but

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
you could do this up at your base but

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.479 
you could do this up at your base but
really<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.860> letting<00:00:44.219> them<00:00:44.340> get

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
really then you're letting them get

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.549 
really then you're letting them get
closer<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.469> take

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.700 
closer so and it's just going to take
more<00:00:46.890> time<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:48.000> he's<00:00:48.120> building<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.379> supply

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you needed it to the four structures

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.179 
you needed it to the four structures
that<00:01:17.250> he<00:01:17.400> deployed<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.170> nothing<00:01:19.950> else

up top and he actually pulled one AFC
bees<00:01:22.590> away<00:01:23.030> again<00:01:24.030> everything<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.570> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bees away again everything is about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
bees away again everything is about
timing<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.310> quickly<00:01:26.670> as

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
timing you know to do it as quickly as

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.070 
timing you know to do it as quickly as
possible<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:27.990> lose<00:01:28.320> any<00:01:28.619> units

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
possible and to not lose any units

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.110 
possible and to not lose any units
so<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.040> know<00:01:31.130> once<00:01:31.370> you<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.850> Marines

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
so you know once you have the Marines

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.750 
so you know once you have the Marines
pull<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.110> one<00:01:33.260> SCD<00:01:33.710> awakes<00:01:33.980> obviously<00:01:34.520> takes

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
pull the one SCD awakes obviously takes

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.210 
pull the one SCD awakes obviously takes
a<00:01:34.880> little<00:01:35.000> more<00:01:35.120> to<00:01:35.710> destroy<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.860> barracks

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
a little more to destroy the barracks

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.220 
a little more to destroy the barracks
and<00:01:37.490> you'll<00:01:37.580> watch<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.120> watch<00:01:38.720> they'll<00:01:38.960> pull

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
and you'll watch and watch they'll pull

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.850 
and you'll watch and watch they'll pull
the<00:01:39.350> other<00:01:39.380> SUV<00:01:40.310> way<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:41.320> off<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.680> supply

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
the other SUV way to off the supply

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.200 
the other SUV way to off the supply
people

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
people

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.840 
people
and<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.409> believe<00:01:45.470> he'd<00:01:45.890> be<00:01:46.070> caught<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.700> he

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
and I believe he'd be caught and he

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.440 
and I believe he'd be caught and he
wasn't<00:01:47.030> concentrating<00:01:47.750> his<00:01:47.840> fire<00:01:48.619> on<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
wasn't concentrating his fire on the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.830 
wasn't concentrating his fire on the
supply<00:01:50.450> depot<00:01:50.510> but<00:01:52.000> well<00:01:53.000> yeah<00:01:53.119> now<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.390> SNF

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
supply depot but well yeah now the SNF

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.160 
supply depot but well yeah now the SNF
Marines<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:54.440> really<00:01:54.800> no<00:01:54.950> need<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
Marines just really no need to have the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.840 
Marines just really no need to have the
STDs<00:01:57.590> there<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.100> mean<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.430> buildings<00:01:58.729> are

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
STDs there I mean the buildings are

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.990 
STDs there I mean the buildings are
damaged<00:01:59.150> but<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.420> doesn't<00:01:59.659> really<00:01:59.720> matter<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
damaged but it doesn't really matter and

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.580 
damaged but it doesn't really matter and
then<00:02:02.200> still<00:02:04.659> eight<00:02:05.659> units<00:02:06.050> left<00:02:06.320> or<00:02:06.500> eight

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
then still eight units left or eight

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.919 
then still eight units left or eight
zerglings<00:02:07.070> left<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:07.909> what<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.209> going<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.509> do

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
zerglings left so what is going to do

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.550 
zerglings left so what is going to do
right<00:02:09.170> here<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:10.009> move<00:02:10.190> his<00:02:10.310> Marines<00:02:10.580> up<00:02:10.850> and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
right here is I move his Marines up and

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.229 
right here is I move his Marines up and
basically<00:02:12.560> anticipate<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.430> next<00:02:13.850> attack

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
basically anticipate the next attack

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.100 
basically anticipate the next attack
from<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.020> zerglings<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.730> know<00:02:16.820> again

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
from the zerglings and you know again

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.150 
from the zerglings and you know again
minimizing<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.350> amount<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.590> time<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.010> takes

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
minimizing the amount of time it takes

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.009 
minimizing the amount of time it takes
to<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:20.120> defend<00:02:20.480> against<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.900> zergling<00:02:21.350> rush

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
to to defend against the zergling rush

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.900 
to to defend against the zergling rush
like<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.080> said<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:24.500> build<00:02:24.890> your<00:02:25.070> ego<00:02:25.580> fall

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
like I said you can build your ego fall

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.699 
like I said you can build your ego fall
off<00:02:26.120> up<00:02:26.360> close<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.630> your<00:02:26.870> base<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:27.440> then<00:02:27.560> it's

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
off up close to your base but then it's

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.199 
off up close to your base but then it's
just<00:02:27.800> going<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.070> take<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.400> longer<00:02:28.610> because<00:02:29.030> it

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
just going to take you longer because it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.090 
just going to take you longer because it
takes<00:02:29.360> more<00:02:29.810> time<00:02:30.050> for<00:02:30.350> certain<00:02:30.680> links<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.980> get

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
takes more time for certain links to get

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.330 
takes more time for certain links to get
up<00:02:31.220> there<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.580> that's<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.480> flawless<00:02:33.340> very

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
up there and that's it flawless very

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.190 
up there and that's it flawless very
very<00:02:34.580> quick<00:02:34.820> time<00:02:35.090> okay<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.780> got<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.080> do

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
very quick time okay now you got to do

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.500 
very quick time okay now you got to do
the<00:02:36.410> Protoss<00:02:36.860> zealot<00:02:37.580> rush<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.390> to

the Protoss zealot rush so you have to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.330 
the Protoss zealot rush so you have to
finish<00:02:41.630> off<00:02:41.930> all<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.010> Protoss

rush defense but then destroy the the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.930 
rush defense but then destroy the the
Protoss<00:02:47.720> base<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.459> he's<00:02:49.459> gonna<00:02:49.579> start<00:02:49.760> off

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
Protoss base and he's gonna start off

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.400 
Protoss base and he's gonna start off
building<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:50.329> couple<00:02:50.959> barracks<00:02:51.320> here<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:53.410> he's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
building a couple barracks here and he's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.380 
building a couple barracks here and he's
got<00:02:54.500> an<00:02:54.769> SCV<00:02:55.040> sitting<00:02:55.430> down<00:02:55.549> there<00:02:55.790> I'm<00:02:56.000> not

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
got an SCV sitting down there I'm not

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.500 
got an SCV sitting down there I'm not
sure<00:02:56.450> timing<00:02:57.049> wise<00:02:57.310> like<00:02:58.310> why<00:02:58.579> he<00:02:58.850> left<00:02:59.209> down

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
sure timing wise like why he left down

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.150 
sure timing wise like why he left down
there<00:02:59.690> like<00:03:00.110> maybe<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.500> could<00:03:00.650> have<00:03:00.739> collected

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
there like maybe it could have collected

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.840 
there like maybe it could have collected
a<00:03:01.250> few<00:03:01.280> minerals<00:03:03.040> or<00:03:04.040> gone<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.610> mineral

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
a few minerals or gone to the mineral

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.280 
a few minerals or gone to the mineral
patch<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.180> couple<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.480> times<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.930> then<00:03:06.049> gone

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
patch a couple of times and then gone

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.250 
patch a couple of times and then gone
down<00:03:06.560> there<00:03:06.799> not<00:03:07.070> exactly<00:03:07.370> sure<00:03:08.170> or<00:03:09.170> if

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
down there not exactly sure or if

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.319 
down there not exactly sure or if
there's<00:03:09.470> an<00:03:09.590> advantage<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.160> actually<00:03:11.060> seeing

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
there's an advantage to actually seeing

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.110 
there's an advantage to actually seeing
the<00:03:11.540> Protoss<00:03:11.900> base<00:03:12.200> at<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.620> point<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:12.950> time

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
the Protoss base at this point in time

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.460 
the Protoss base at this point in time
but<00:03:14.120> anyways<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:14.690> he's<00:03:14.810> waiting<00:03:14.959> for<00:03:15.170> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
but anyways what he's waiting for it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.440 
but anyways what he's waiting for it
here<00:03:15.829> is<00:03:15.980> enough<00:03:16.579> minerals<00:03:16.820> once<00:03:17.299> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
here is enough minerals once the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.240 
here is enough minerals once the
barracks<00:03:17.780> are<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:18.200> then<00:03:18.920> he's<00:03:19.040> going<00:03:19.160> to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
barracks are going then he's going to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.740 
barracks are going then he's going to
take<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.519> SUV<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.180> going<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.420> build<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.630> bunker

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
take that SUV is going to build a bunker

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.819 
take that SUV is going to build a bunker
alright<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.780> what<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.260> bunker<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.620> going<00:03:24.769> to

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
alright and what the bunker is going to

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.120 
alright and what the bunker is going to
do<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.220> obviously<00:03:25.850> once<00:03:26.360> we<00:03:26.570> get<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:27.130> submarine

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
do is obviously once we get a submarine

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.949 
do is obviously once we get a submarine
strained<00:03:28.549> it's<00:03:29.269> going<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.510> protect<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
strained it's going to protect the

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.460 
strained it's going to protect the
Marines<00:03:30.850> while<00:03:31.850> they<00:03:32.540> destroy<00:03:32.989> while<00:03:33.290> they're

Marines while they destroy while they're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.170 
Marines while they destroy while they're
firing<00:03:33.680> at<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.920> zealots<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.790> zealot<00:03:35.060> can

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
firing at the zealots and the zealot can

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.759 
firing at the zealots and the zealot can
attack<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.600> structure<00:03:35.989> at<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.320> same<00:03:36.590> time

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
attack the structure at the same time

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.220 
attack the structure at the same time
have<00:03:37.070> have<00:03:37.820> a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
have have a

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
so now he's trying to talk the structure

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.110 
so now he's trying to talk the structure
have<00:03:41.390> an<00:03:41.780> SCV<00:03:42.140> preparing<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.549> he's<00:03:43.940> basically

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
have an SCV preparing so he's basically

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.210 
have an SCV preparing so he's basically
buying<00:03:44.840> time<00:03:45.200> here<00:03:45.530> running<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.980> marine

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220
