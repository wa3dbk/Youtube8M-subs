00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.770
 thank you for finding everyone nice 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.770
 view 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.650
 all url with you fashion ssilka 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.250
 and this is the long awaited second part of the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.810
 expected 2015 games see what 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.810
 on 3 developers were preparing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.530
 this race will delight you in March 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.230
 month of stunning graphics 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.409
 crazy attention detailing machines 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.360
 petros divine weather effects 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.769
 anyone who considers himself a racing fan 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 or just love this genre 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.930
 waiting for the project cass and we are no exception 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 I noticed here that March in general 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 thanked for 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.309
 it will be necessary to start up this month's 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.979
 bloodborne also aims for march fans 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.509
 dark souls demon souls and ps4 owners 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.509
 probably delighted 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.770
 the artists of this game are probably souls 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.030
 sold to learn how to draw such 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.460
 creepy beasts 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.979
 but the main thing is that the selection is not just another 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.070
 sauce here the emphasis goes on stunned and dodging 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.470
 the armor itself will not be this one 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.689
 moment a little alarming already 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.909
 more difficult then let's hope that all these 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.250
 flirting with complexity not gloom 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.250
 will turn the game into not consider annoying 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.490
 Well, at least you should not worry about the schedule 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.560
 she is truly on gas gene sky 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.690
 millions of small parts in everything starting 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.819
 from the blue dilapidated dog and 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.360
 ending the dash with dozens of bones and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.640
 skulls 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.959
 in the guise of monsters to their on our way 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.959
 will abound 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.310
 not sure if honestly that star citizen 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.040
 will have time to go out in 2015 but if it comes out 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.620
 and it will be just a bomb 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.960
 the most ambitious the most expensive 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.600
 cosmostimulator what ever was 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.390
 stories being done on fan 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.760
 money and amounts are not small there 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.610
 but the beginning of the development required to collect 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.130
 500,000 dollars now invested in the game 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.410
 think almost seven hundred forty thousand 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.370
 man the total amount of money they gave 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.400
 user 71 million dollars here already 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.920
 developers will have to really try 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.530
 moisture makers a freelancer know a lot about 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.370
 space and they will surely succeed 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.190
 what do gt promise us from the world and calls 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.430
 Massimov we are waiting for piracy mercenary 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.860
 business building mega - corporations race 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.560
 first person shooting to at least 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.930
 downloads completely open world thousands 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.420
 planets in cities the opportunity to play like that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.670
 like you want it yourself but everything from above 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.450
 seasoned with great graphics 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.850
 waiting oh how is made anyone who even 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.110
 somehow familiar with games surely knows about 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.050
 metal gear solid 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.330
 this is the most correct military drama not 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.970
 such series and films are not even remotely 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.970
 can so hook as a given series of games 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.889
 those twists of the plot twist and that to us 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.830
 issued a metal gir solid for his 25 years 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.900
 firmly settled in the memory of the players if you 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.360
 someone did not roar at the end of his quitter 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.460
 soulless beast and metal gear solid 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.979
 five promises to be if not the best 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:57.470
 then at least one of the main parts 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:59.090
 in the history of the gp series briefly 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.699
 tell about her in the context of this 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.159
 plot we can't short metal gir 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.840
 solid but not at all but if you 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.759
 interested then write in 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.039
 comments and perhaps specifically for 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.250
 we will make you a separate video for this 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.830
 series about how much you can transfer 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.590
 the third witch want him right now 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.930
 about such thoughts and desires arise 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.690
 every fan of RPD games 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.090
 unfortunately at the moment many 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.110
 For some reason, the developers believe that lpg 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.419
 this zadrotstvo 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.759
 and calling out millions of radio monsters 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.039
 purple clothes and the plot on 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.830
 level detectives don with dialogue 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.990
 who wrote lazy and pretentious idiots 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.960
 but a series of games about Zelda 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.449
 completely different witch is and beautiful 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.250
 book dialogues and well thought out 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.659
 plot with thousands of his decisions which 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.360
 takes the player himself 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.029
 good relationship to the source a bunch 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.680
 branches in all and all not fully 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:57.620
 linear transmission pattern 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.900
 open seamless world and of course 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.740
 nice graphics apparently which 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.039
 definitely the most anticipated project of 2015 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.039
 of the year 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.589
 so we watched the top ten 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:23.110
 expected games of 2015 hope 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:25.569
 the developers won't let us down but all
