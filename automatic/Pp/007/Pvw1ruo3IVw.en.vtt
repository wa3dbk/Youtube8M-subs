00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
pretty much doing the same thing I did

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.319 
pretty much doing the same thing I did
last<00:00:42.090> week<00:00:42.530> acts<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.829> our<00:00:44.010> push<00:00:44.219> press<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:45.180> not

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
last week acts of our push press I'm not

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.410 
last week acts of our push press I'm not
trying<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.780> push<00:00:45.989> crush<00:00:46.230> strength<00:00:46.649> up

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
trying to get my push crush strength up

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.760 
trying to get my push crush strength up
worked<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> heavy<00:00:48.870> set<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> five<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.710> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
worked up to a heavy set of five but I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
worked up to a heavy set of five but I
wanted<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.180> week<00:00:51.420> than<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.170> did

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
wanted to do more this week than I did

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.799 
wanted to do more this week than I did
last<00:00:52.969> week<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> twenty<00:00:55.649> five

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
last week so we get it to twenty five

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.439 
last week so we get it to twenty five
for<00:00:57.809> five<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.980> week<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.430> went<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.030> thirty<00:01:00.270> five

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
for five this week I went to thirty five

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.620 
for five this week I went to thirty five
for<00:01:00.719> five

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.720 

the<00:01:11.630> reason<00:01:11.870> I<00:01:11.930> use<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.440> thumbless<00:01:13.100> grip<00:01:13.430> or

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
the reason I use a thumbless grip or

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.200 
the reason I use a thumbless grip or
suicided<00:01:14.420> grip<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:15.200> because<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.940> makes<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:17.090> lot

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
suicided grip is because it makes a lot

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.630 
suicided grip is because it makes a lot
easier<00:01:17.450> hold<00:01:17.660> on<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:17.960> think<00:01:18.460> think<00:01:19.460> wrapping

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
easier hold on to I think think wrapping

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.800 
easier hold on to I think think wrapping
my<00:01:19.820> thumb<00:01:20.090> or<00:01:20.210> on<00:01:20.300> that<00:01:20.420> fat<00:01:20.900> axial<00:01:21.380> bar

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
my thumb or on that fat axial bar

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.630 
my thumb or on that fat axial bar
bothers<00:01:23.810> my<00:01:23.960> wrists<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.310> makes<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.580> little

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
bothers my wrists so it makes a little

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.610 
bothers my wrists so it makes a little
bit<00:01:25.760> easier<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:26.390> hold<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.230> with<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.410> thumb

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
bit easier to hold on so with a thumb

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.789 
bit easier to hold on so with a thumb
one<00:01:27.770> script

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.100 

the<00:01:34.310> weight<00:01:34.460> felt<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:35.180> little<00:01:35.329> heavy<00:01:35.570> today<00:01:35.720> I

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
the weight felt a little heavy today I

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.749 
the weight felt a little heavy today I
don't<00:01:36.409> know<00:01:36.470> why<00:01:36.680> we<00:01:37.399> might<00:01:37.549> have<00:01:37.670> been

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
don't know why we might have been

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.920 
don't know why we might have been
because<00:01:38.090> all<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.299> press<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.659> ended<00:01:38.869> on

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
because all the press and ended on

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.350 
because all the press and ended on
Friday<00:01:39.229> but<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.040> felt<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.310> little<00:01:40.369> bit<00:01:40.610> heavier

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
Friday but I felt a little bit heavier

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.260 
Friday but I felt a little bit heavier
than<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.600> should<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:42.220> if<00:01:43.220> sometimes<00:01:43.670> our<00:01:43.909> 892

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
than it should have if sometimes our 892

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:57.740 
than it should have if sometimes our 892
it<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:44.689> do<00:01:44.930> it

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:20.740 

2:35
