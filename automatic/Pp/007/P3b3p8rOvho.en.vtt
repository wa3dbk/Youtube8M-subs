all<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.850> wonderful<00:01:45.680> reinforcement<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
all of this wonderful reinforcement that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.219 
all of this wonderful reinforcement that
went<00:01:47.040> into<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.000> roof<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> back<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
went into the roof and to the back of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
went into the roof and to the back of
the<00:01:49.320> car<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:50.040> reinforcements<00:01:50.909> throughout

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the car with reinforcements throughout

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.000 
the car with reinforcements throughout
the<00:01:51.329> back<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
the back of the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.060 
the back of the
they<00:01:52.490> got<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.850> 80%<00:01:53.180> rigidity<00:01:54.140> improvement

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
they got that 80% rigidity improvement

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.760 
they got that 80% rigidity improvement
they<00:01:55.520> were<00:01:55.580> able<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.030> plumb<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.230> 5<00:01:57.560> liter

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
they were able to plumb in the 5 liter

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.450 
they were able to plumb in the 5 liter
supercharged<00:01:58.640> v8<00:01:59.030> with<00:01:59.480> 550<00:02:00.350> horsepower<00:02:00.830> now

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
supercharged v8 with 550 horsepower now

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.220 
supercharged v8 with 550 horsepower now
that<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> lot<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.360> power<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.780> small<00:02:02.900> car

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
that is a lot of power in a small car

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.020 
that is a lot of power in a small car
like<00:02:03.440> this<00:02:03.620> we're<00:02:04.100> talking<00:02:04.490> supercar

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
like this we're talking supercar

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.910 
like this we're talking supercar
territory<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:06.080> now<00:02:06.200> we're<00:02:06.380> heading<00:02:06.650> out<00:02:06.710> onto

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
territory so now we're heading out onto

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.830 
territory so now we're heading out onto
the<00:02:07.100> track<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:08.149> going<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.540> what<00:02:08.750> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
the track and we're going to see what it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.370 
the track and we're going to see what it
can<00:02:08.960> do

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
can do

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.350 
can do
fingers<00:02:09.800> Bravo<00:02:10.040> we<00:02:10.369> go<00:02:10.790> with<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> three

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
fingers Bravo we go with a three

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.240 
fingers Bravo we go with a three
different<00:02:11.750> model<00:02:12.050> f-type<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.860> start<00:02:13.160> out

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
different model f-type so you start out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.400 
different model f-type so you start out
with<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.820> basically<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.870> f-type<00:02:15.200> with

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
with the basically the the f-type with

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.440 
with the basically the the f-type with
340<00:02:16.070> horsepower<00:02:16.190> than<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.910> would<00:02:17.030> smoke<00:02:17.210> by

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
340 horsepower than you would smoke by

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.870 
340 horsepower than you would smoke by
with<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.810> old<00:02:18.040> differential<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.520> then<00:02:19.790> when

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
with that old differential and then when

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.630 
with that old differential and then when
you<00:02:20.000> move<00:02:20.180> up<00:02:20.360> into<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.720> f-type<00:02:21.290> s<00:02:21.620> now<00:02:22.400> you're

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
you move up into the f-type s now you're

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.760 
you move up into the f-type s now you're
going<00:02:22.850> from<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.150> fixed<00:02:23.630> amperes<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
going from the fixed amperes to the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.370 
going from the fixed amperes to the
adaptive<00:02:25.340> than<00:02:25.370> average<00:02:25.850> dampeners<00:02:26.600> into<00:02:27.350> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
adaptive than average dampeners into a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.860 
adaptive than average dampeners into a
limited<00:02:27.770> slip<00:02:27.980> diff<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.300> go<00:02:29.480> from

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
limited slip diff and then you go from

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.640 
limited slip diff and then you go from
the<00:02:30.050> f-type<00:02:30.590> s<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:32.060> 380<00:02:32.630> horsepower<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.470> move

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
the f-type s and 380 horsepower you move

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.450 
the f-type s and 380 horsepower you move
up<00:02:33.860> into<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.970> f-type<00:02:35.480> R<00:02:35.930> coupe<00:02:36.260> which<00:02:37.160> is
