00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 the municipality of the heron in the interior of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 paulo was once again the seat of the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.780
 workshop on commercial reforestation 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.340
 of noble woods 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 the event organized by the company 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.010
 tropical flora reformer met 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 farmers and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 researchers from different locations of the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:33.540
 country with almost 10 years in the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.579
 tropical reforestation plant has become 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 reference in the production of seedlings 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.010
 noble woods founded by the businessman 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.320
 pedro appeared cyril the company has 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.149
 developed research 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 in the forestry sector 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.340
 I think what's important for the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.820
 investor who wants to enter this 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 activity is that it will exit for example 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 medium- term short-term 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 enter into a long-term investment 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 but with a fantastic result because the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.180
 every passing day we have - wood 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 noble 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 every day that passes the interest rates 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.619
 that the paid market is smaller and the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.500
 wood prices are higher 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.909
 so we'll have it soon 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.860
 investors investing in the long run 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.400
 to increase profitability 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 This is something that we have to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.950
 I like people who want to do 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 a reforestation they are investing 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.689
 in the solid market a market that will 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.829
 ensure a promising future in the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.200
 financial 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.960
 This is the fourth edition of the workshop 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.420
 implementation and management and the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 perspectives of the planted forests of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.950
 Noble woods in Brazil are we 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.850
 that good planning monitoring 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.649
 and the producer since his / her 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.869
 beginning is already successful in the deployment 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.640
 good initial development in the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.100
 choice of species ne 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.860
 and in the future, it's logical that he 's good 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.840
 financial income is that it is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 extremely attractive for what the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.239
 sector has attracted interest 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.690
 values â€‹â€‹we can get in the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.880
 wood there in the future 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.980
 wood has today and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.830
 for the ecological benefits behind 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.470
 property is environmental there is no 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.210
 preservation of natural resources 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.790
 more than 100 people participated in the 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.310
 event and were able to clarify their doubts 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.330
 issues such as the challenge of investing 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.730
 noble woods 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.920
 the main species viability 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 and modes of management 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.640
 The beginning is difficult because we have 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.700
 observed even here in the workshop that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.220
 mechanization it helps a lot at the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.160
 both of preparation for planting and 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.380
 after driving the forest but the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.590
 machinery is a high investment that the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.680
 people should probably not give up 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.410
 still in the beginning the costs of irrigation 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.220
 that in the bay we are going to implant and 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.640
 liver are also a bit high but 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.710
 as I told you as added value 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.790
 compensates for projections for the future are 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.880
 always better to we believe that 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.950
 will have to struggle with these difficulties 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.100
 mainly for financial 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.660
 because it will compensate in a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.239
 mid-term 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.239
 in closing a day of visits the 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.489
 participants were able to know the field 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.489
 close to the commercial plantations of 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.190
 company on the Lubre farm were planted 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.370
 more than 100 guanandi hectares on site 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.620
 endorse almost nine years ready for 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.100
 first thinning caught the attention of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.100
 all 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.290
 in the field visit were demonstrated 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.390
 handling techniques can thin 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.239
 highlighting the importance of a 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.020
 evaluation and monitoring of 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.020
 any development 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.230
 the intention of actually knowing 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.650
 diversify one more activity within 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.880
 of the farm and with that to seek another 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.890
 profitability 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.560
 although it is a long-term profitability 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.960
 but it is an intention that we have 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.000
 put inside the farm since 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.820
 we have other activities are short 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.610
 time where the hardwood 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.310
 harvest may take up to 20 years but 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.520
 who invests guarantees patience is 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.860
 offset by the profits 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.810
 if done correctly is with 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.870
 professional accompaniment with 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.210
 appropriate management methodologies and 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.970
 slides menezes phyto sanitary 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.150
 appropriate nutritional 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.910
 this is a fantastic performance right has 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.730
 rates of return 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.490
 return from 15 to 20 per cent. 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.650
 percent rate of return to what is to 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.090
 who has the knowledge economy it 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.760
 They are fantastic there, huh? 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.020
 is an extremely profitable activity and 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.490
 which has to be accompanied 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.490
 professionally made in the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.310
 correct so that you can actually 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.030
 is to get the profits out of your forecast 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.520
 initial 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.040
 life goes on farms and cove 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.160
 are pedro with plantations consorted with 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.860
 coffee grown with guanandy and mahogany 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.260
 African species and violence and 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.190
 Senegal and also with palm hearts 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.240
 pupunha 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.030
 Look at the intercropped planting it has to 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.400
 advantage of bringing income before 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.850
 the final cut of the wood then we have 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.730
 invested in some species to make 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.680
 to this type of cultivation and at the 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.710
 People thought more about the small and medium 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.690
 farmer who needs the income is 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.260
 which can not invest for many 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.210
 years just to wait for the slabs of 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.669
 the final cut of the wood 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.470
 so here we have the experience with 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.300
 the coffee and with the pupunha 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.090
 We have already experimented with various 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.790
 other types of crops but what we 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.310
 liked it more was the coffee and the palm heart 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.010
 pupunha right here itself 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.220
 typing was a good first to first 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.639
 experience that we have made 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.909
 year 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.830
 with coffee and we have already created 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.719
 other types of model is not because 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.969
 people realize that here it is well 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.919
 advanced and we will have to 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.439
 remove some trees for us to give 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.629
 a little more space for coffee but the 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.300
 people have already had an excellent harvest 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:42.599
 here in the beginning is this year even people 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.229
 already has a lot of coffee and is a 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.719
 production so it is not the same but it is well 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.550
 similar to pure planting, 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:52.080
 in coffee 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.689
 so it's worth it to bring 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.610
 financial sustainability for the 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.759
 producer who only has a small piece of 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.069
 land does not want to plant an annual crop 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.439
 It's a culture that can have money right? 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:06.509
 every year but he also has 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.340
 together with the trees that 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.340
 are distributed in the same tableware 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.900
 ae
