the but only one piece of this painting

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.729 
the but only one piece of this painting
you<00:06:34.999> will<00:06:35.269> imagine<00:06:35.749> what<00:06:35.959> the<00:06:36.139> rest<00:06:36.319> of<00:06:36.589> the

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:36.739 
you will imagine what the rest of the

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:38.949 
you will imagine what the rest of the
person<00:06:37.159> looks<00:06:37.399> like<00:06:37.639> but<00:06:38.149> you<00:06:38.269> will<00:06:38.509> be<00:06:38.539> wrong

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:38.959 
person looks like but you will be wrong

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:42.369 
person looks like but you will be wrong
and<00:06:39.769> there<00:06:40.639> is<00:06:40.759> another<00:06:40.939> aspect<00:06:41.269> of<00:06:41.719> it<00:06:41.899> I<00:06:42.079> mean

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:42.379 
and there is another aspect of it I mean

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.339 
and there is another aspect of it I mean
once<00:06:42.889> people<00:06:43.429> form<00:06:43.699> a<00:06:43.939> certain<00:06:44.599> image<00:06:44.809> of<00:06:45.139> you

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
once people form a certain image of you

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.109 
once people form a certain image of you
they<00:06:46.009> expect<00:06:46.579> you<00:06:46.729> to<00:06:46.849> act<00:06:47.059> accordingly<00:06:47.739> and<00:06:49.119> I

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.119 
they expect you to act accordingly and I

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:52.779 
they expect you to act accordingly and I
think<00:06:50.539> that<00:06:51.110> sometimes<00:06:51.439> conflicts<00:06:52.339> arise

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
think that sometimes conflicts arise

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.569 
think that sometimes conflicts arise
when<00:06:53.179> we<00:06:53.419> don't<00:06:53.629> but<00:06:54.589> that's<00:06:54.709> a<00:06:54.889> whole<00:06:55.129> another

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:55.579 
when we don't but that's a whole another

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.589 
when we don't but that's a whole another
story<00:06:55.879> I<00:06:56.359> guess<00:06:56.689> and<00:06:57.639> maybe<00:06:58.639> another<00:06:59.059> subject

00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 
story I guess and maybe another subject

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:05.619 
story I guess and maybe another subject
