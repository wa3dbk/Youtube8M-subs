00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.570 
have battle number 94 right here and i'm
using<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.570> fame<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:23.300> people<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.600> its<00:00:25.590> team

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
using my fame in people like its team

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.050 
using my fame in people like its team
the<00:00:27.240> regigigas<00:00:27.599> team<00:00:28.109> which<00:00:28.939> revolves<00:00:29.939> around

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the regigigas team which revolves around

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.440 
the regigigas team which revolves around
using<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:31.340> really<00:00:32.340> powerful<00:00:32.730> regigigas<00:00:33.059> he's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
using my really powerful regigigas he's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.930 
using my really powerful regigigas he's
built<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.840> defense<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.290> he<00:00:34.440> becomes<00:00:35.070> really

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
built for defense but he becomes really

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840 
built for defense but he becomes really
for<00:00:36.270> middle<00:00:36.559> formidable<00:00:37.559> offense<00:00:38.129> eventually

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
for middle formidable offense eventually

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.709 
for middle formidable offense eventually
so<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.329> start<00:00:42.510> off<00:00:42.570> with

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
so so what I do is I just start off with

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.560 
so so what I do is I just start off with
a<00:00:42.750> stockpile<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.800> follow<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.579> make

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
a stockpile and I just follow me to make

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.520 
a stockpile and I just follow me to make
all<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> opponent's<00:00:46.440> attack<00:00:46.829> clefable<00:00:47.520> which

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
all the opponent's attack clefable which

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.939 
all the opponent's attack clefable which
you<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.649> we'll<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.010> keep<00:00:51.440> drifblim<00:00:52.440> safe

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you know we'll just keep drifblim safe

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.670 
you know we'll just keep drifblim safe
and<00:00:53.390> hydro<00:00:54.390> pump<00:00:54.510> mrs.<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.500> would

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and hydro pump mrs. but it would

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.799 
and hydro pump mrs. but it would
actually<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.940> need<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> survive<00:00:57.750> for

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
actually I just need to survive for

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
actually I just need to survive for
three<00:00:58.170> turns<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.820> hydro<00:00:59.820> pump<00:01:00.000> even<00:01:00.629> from<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
three turns and hydro pump even from a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
three turns and hydro pump even from a
pelipper<00:01:01.500> probably<00:01:02.010> wouldn't<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
pelipper probably wouldn't be that

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.810 
pelipper probably wouldn't be that
strong<00:01:03.210> against<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.690> fables<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.159> actually

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
strong against go fables so the actually

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.609 
strong against go fables so the actually
soon<00:01:06.090> racal<00:01:06.390> fable<00:01:06.750> gets<00:01:07.170> knocked<00:01:07.380> out

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
soon racal fable gets knocked out

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.330 
soon racal fable gets knocked out
usually<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> better<00:01:09.380> just<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> case<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
usually the better just in this case it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
usually the better just in this case it
was<00:01:11.520> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> helpful<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.380> bound<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
was kind of helpful but it's bound to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
was kind of helpful but it's bound to
miss<00:01:13.890> eventually<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.580> least<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
miss eventually at least one of the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.530 
miss eventually at least one of the
times<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> lecturer<00:01:17.610> uses<00:01:17.880> crunch<00:01:18.240> again

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
times and so lecturer uses crunch again

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.770 
times and so lecturer uses crunch again
and<00:01:19.430> hits<00:01:20.430> clefable<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:23.570> hydrant<00:01:24.570> misses

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and hits clefable and so hydrant misses

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
and hits clefable and so hydrant misses
again<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> was<00:01:25.439> actually<00:01:25.650> hoping<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.400> would

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
again but I was actually hoping it would

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.789 
again but I was actually hoping it would
get<00:01:26.610> knocked<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.360> turn<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:28.409> actually

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
get knocked out that turn will actually

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.140 
get knocked out that turn will actually
know<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> knocked<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.060> have

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
know when I knocked it out it would have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.960 
know when I knocked it out it would have
just<00:01:30.500> gotten<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.040> close<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.430> zero<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
just gotten it really close to zero and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.160 
just gotten it really close to zero and
then<00:01:33.119> lecture<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> could<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.810> finished<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
then lecture I could have finished it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.920 
then lecture I could have finished it
off<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.729> didn't<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.820> matter<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.360> if

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
off but didn't really matter because if

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.660 
off but didn't really matter because if
Hydra<00:01:37.710> problem<00:01:37.920> had<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> hit<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.549> those

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
Hydra problem had to hit one of those

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.210 
Hydra problem had to hit one of those
times<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:39.540> still<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.380> gone<00:01:40.979> right

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
times then still when gone right

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
times then still when gone right
according<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.850> plan<00:01:42.090> would<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.600> been<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
according to plan would have been a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.859 
according to plan would have been a
shorter<00:01:43.110> battle<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> our<00:01:45.270> stockpile<00:01:45.689> for

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
shorter battle and so our stockpile for

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.240 
shorter battle and so our stockpile for
the<00:01:45.930> third<00:01:46.170> time<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:47.340> defenses<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:48.329> now

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
the third time and my defenses are now

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.649 
the third time and my defenses are now
multiply<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.490> two<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> half<00:01:50.970> times<00:01:51.360> so

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
multiply about two and a half times so

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
multiply about two and a half times so
that's<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:51.990> good<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.590> luxury<00:01:53.100> discharged

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that's really good and luxury discharged

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
that's really good and luxury discharged
I<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.070> you're

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I was like really like you know you're

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.560 
I was like really like you know you're
going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> knock<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:56.880> pelipper<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
going to knock out your pelipper that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.660 
going to knock out your pelipper that
way<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.469> maybe<00:01:58.860> they<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.070> wanted<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> get

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
way but maybe they just wanted to get

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
way but maybe they just wanted to get
help<00:02:00.149> or<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.750> maybe<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.229> just

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
help or out of the way maybe they just

and they get a critical on their own
palkia<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:54.900> weak<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.350> doesn't

otherwise<00:03:02.280> clefable<00:03:02.910> would<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.530> help<00:03:04.530> drift

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
otherwise clefable would just help drift

with<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.570> skill<00:03:19.050> swap<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.709> regigigas<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.880> I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
with I skill swap it with regigigas so I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.330 
with I skill swap it with regigigas so I
swap<00:03:21.450> um<00:03:22.910> unburden<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.780> basically<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.830> i

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
swap um unburden and that basically if i

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.420 
swap um unburden and that basically if i
use<00:03:27.180> my<00:03:27.330> held<00:03:27.540> item<00:03:27.690> my<00:03:28.020> speed<00:03:28.350> doubles<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.190> i

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
use my held item my speed doubles so i

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.180

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
get hit with spacial rend is quite a bit

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.790 
get hit with spacial rend is quite a bit
of<00:03:32.310> damage<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.850> that's<00:03:33.060> okay<00:03:33.630> because<00:03:33.800> it's

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
of damage but that's okay because it's

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
not the most you know it's nothing too

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.460 
not the most you know it's nothing too
bad<00:03:37.080> going<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.840> Reggie<00:03:39.840> geeks<00:03:40.110> takes

bad going on so Reggie geeks takes
another<00:03:40.770> hit<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.340> he's<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.790> pretty<00:03:42.360> bad

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
another hit so he's in pretty bad

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.530 
another hit so he's in pretty bad
condition<00:03:42.600> now<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.590> now<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.790> psych<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.390> on

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
condition now but now I psych up on

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.500 
condition now but now I psych up on
drifblim<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.620> all<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:47.070> his<00:03:47.280> stats<00:03:47.820> or<00:03:48.090> copied

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
drifblim and all of his stats or copied

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.940 
drifblim and all of his stats or copied
now<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.900> he<00:03:49.110> has<00:03:49.200> two<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.590> half<00:03:49.739> times

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
now so he has two and a half times

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.340 
now so he has two and a half times
defenses<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:51.300> he<00:03:51.390> has<00:03:51.510> really<00:03:51.900> high<00:03:51.989> defense

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
defenses so he has really high defense

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.400 
defenses so he has really high defense
now<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:54.060> skill<00:03:54.360> swapped<00:03:54.630> his<00:03:54.780> bat<00:03:54.959> ability

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
now and I skill swapped his bat ability

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.920 
now and I skill swapped his bat ability
off<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:55.770> he<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.550> actually<00:03:56.730> move<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.570> some

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
off so he can actually move with some

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.590 
off so he can actually move with some
you<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.290> relative<00:03:59.160> speed<00:03:59.520> so<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.360> takes

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
you know relative speed so it takes

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.820 
you know relative speed so it takes
another<00:04:00.870> spit<00:04:01.140> he<00:04:01.290> actually<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.680> take

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
another spit he actually can take

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.270 
another spit he actually can take
spatial<00:04:02.280> runs<00:04:02.489> now<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.709> easily<00:04:04.709> resisted

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
spatial runs now and easily resisted

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.910 
spatial runs now and easily resisted
that<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.600> go<00:04:06.900> ahead<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.170> use<00:04:07.320> drain<00:04:07.650> punch

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
that so I go ahead and I use drain punch

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.710 
that so I go ahead and I use drain punch
because<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.459> need<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.730> get<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.880> little<00:04:09.000> HP<00:04:09.269> back

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
because I need to get a little HP back

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.890 
because I need to get a little HP back
but<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:11.160> doesn't<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.580> water<00:04:12.000> damage<00:04:12.480> which

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
but it doesn't do a water damage which

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.540 
but it doesn't do a water damage which
is<00:04:13.080> expecting<00:04:13.590> his<00:04:13.650> pal<00:04:13.890> ki<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.100> pretty<00:04:14.340> bulky

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
is expecting his pal ki is pretty bulky

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.970 
is expecting his pal ki is pretty bulky
and<00:04:14.820> drain<00:04:15.030> punch<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.420> only<00:04:15.600> 60<00:04:16.049> power<00:04:16.230> but

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
and drain punch is only 60 power but

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.440 
and drain punch is only 60 power but
that's<00:04:17.160> okay<00:04:17.459> because<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.120> needed<00:04:18.359> this

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
that's okay because I just needed this

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.160 
that's okay because I just needed this

regigigas way weaker than spacial rend
and<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:32.010> resists<00:04:32.370> now<00:04:32.520> here's<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.030> height<00:04:33.270> of

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
and it resists now here's the height of

my<00:04:33.540> strategy<00:04:34.110> right<00:04:34.140> here<00:04:34.350> so<00:04:35.130> i<00:04:35.160> use<00:04:35.520> swagger

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
my strategy right here so i use swagger

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.630 
my strategy right here so i use swagger
on<00:04:36.330> regigigas<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.770> might<00:04:37.920> say<00:04:38.040> why<00:04:38.460> would

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
on regigigas and you might say why would

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.570 
on regigigas and you might say why would
I<00:04:38.700> do<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.880> well<00:04:39.590> regigigas<00:04:40.590> has<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.010> one<00:04:41.310> Barry

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
I do that well regigigas has a one Barry

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.410 
I do that well regigigas has a one Barry
and<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:42.360> will<00:04:43.050> heal<00:04:43.590> its<00:04:43.800> confusion<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.580> my

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
and that will heal its confusion and my

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.230 
and that will heal its confusion and my
attack<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.960> now<00:04:46.250> boosted<00:04:47.250> because<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.910> swagger

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
attack is now boosted because of swagger

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.840 
attack is now boosted because of swagger
and<00:04:48.420> because<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> used<00:04:49.620> up<00:04:49.740> my<00:04:49.800> held<00:04:50.100> item<00:04:50.280> now

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
and because I used up my held item now

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.520 
and because I used up my held item now
unburden<00:04:51.450> activates<00:04:51.840> giving<00:04:52.080> me<00:04:52.170> double

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
unburden activates giving me double

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.230 
unburden activates giving me double
speed<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:52.980> have<00:04:53.100> double<00:04:53.490> speed<00:04:53.700> two<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.180> a

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
speed so I have double speed two and a

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.000 
speed so I have double speed two and a
half<00:04:54.270> times<00:04:54.570> defenses<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.350> double<00:04:55.740> attack

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
half times defenses and double attack

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.420 
half times defenses and double attack
because<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.750> swagger<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:58.470> regigigas<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:59.250> in

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
because of swagger so regigigas is in

deoxys<00:05:15.000> could<00:05:15.210> outrun<00:05:15.570> him<00:05:15.840> at<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:16.560> point<00:05:16.800> so

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
deoxys could outrun him at this point so

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.240 
deoxys could outrun him at this point so
and<00:05:17.940> he<00:05:18.390> has<00:05:18.480> more<00:05:18.720> defense<00:05:19.080> than<00:05:19.230> any<00:05:19.710> Pokemon

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
and he has more defense than any Pokemon

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.750 
and he has more defense than any Pokemon
could<00:05:20.460> get<00:05:20.640> normally<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:22.190> his<00:05:23.190> attack<00:05:23.460> is<00:05:23.640> off

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
could get normally and his attack is off

could get normally and his attack is off
the<00:05:23.940> charts<00:05:24.330> his<00:05:24.570> attack<00:05:24.930> he<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:25.890> like<00:05:26.150> 450<00:05:27.150> I

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
the charts his attack he is like 450 I

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.520 
the charts his attack he is like 450 I
think<00:05:27.480> right<00:05:27.630> now<00:05:28.280> meaning<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.880> he<00:05:29.940> has<00:05:30.540> that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
think right now meaning that he has that

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.900 
think right now meaning that he has that
be<00:05:31.680> about<00:05:31.860> 900<00:05:32.820> physical<00:05:33.450> attack<00:05:33.690> now<00:05:34.140> that's

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
be about 900 physical attack now that's

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.770 
be about 900 physical attack now that's
crazy<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.870> he's<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.620> he<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.880> beast<00:05:39.240> right<00:05:39.630> now

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
crazy so he's a he is a beast right now

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.410 
crazy so he's a he is a beast right now
he's<00:05:40.350> a<00:05:40.380> beast<00:05:40.740> on<00:05:40.950> steroids<00:05:41.520> was<00:05:42.000> basically

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
he's a beast on steroids was basically

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.620 
he's a beast on steroids was basically
you<00:05:43.170> know<00:05:43.290> he's<00:05:43.470> achieved<00:05:44.060> Chuck<00:05:45.060> he's<00:05:45.390> almost

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
you know he's achieved Chuck he's almost

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.020 
you know he's achieved Chuck he's almost
achieved<00:05:45.960> Chuck<00:05:46.530> Norris<00:05:46.860> level<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:47.790> in<00:05:47.970> the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
achieved Chuck Norris level so in the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.850 
achieved Chuck Norris level so in the
intimidate<00:05:48.540> hits<00:05:48.780> but<00:05:49.140> it's<00:05:49.350> not<00:05:49.590> going<00:05:49.770> to

intimidate hits but it's not going to

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.650 
intimidate hits but it's not going to
matter<00:05:49.980> because<00:05:50.490> his<00:05:50.790> attacks<00:05:51.120> already<00:05:51.510> off

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
matter because his attacks already off

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.450

the<00:05:51.900> charts<00:05:52.290> it<00:05:52.470> can't<00:05:52.650> really<00:05:52.830> damaged<00:05:53.370> it

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
the charts it can't really damaged it

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.500 
the charts it can't really damaged it
that<00:05:53.640> much<00:05:53.850> so<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:55.200> drain<00:05:55.740> punch<00:05:56.480> in<00:05:57.480> Polian<00:05:58.430> and

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
that much so I drain punch in Polian and

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.220 
that much so I drain punch in Polian and
it<00:06:00.510> does<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:01.020> lot<00:06:01.470> of<00:06:01.530> damage<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:03.720> don't<00:06:04.140> know
