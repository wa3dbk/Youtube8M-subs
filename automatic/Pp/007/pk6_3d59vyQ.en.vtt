I just love this particular stamp and
what's<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.569> funny<00:01:58.929> about<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.679> that<00:01:59.950> this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
what's so funny about it is that this

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.190 
what's so funny about it is that this
stamp<00:02:00.850> wasn't<00:02:01.149> even<00:02:01.329> supposed<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.780> be<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.049> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
stamp wasn't even supposed to be in the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.679 
stamp wasn't even supposed to be in the
set<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:03.369> was<00:02:03.520> just<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.850> little<00:02:04.210> line<00:02:04.420> that

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
set and it was just a little line that

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.779 
set and it was just a little line that
was<00:02:04.810> left<00:02:05.109> over<00:02:05.289> from<00:02:05.500> our<00:02:05.859> plate<00:02:06.100> making<00:02:06.399> and

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
was left over from our plate making and

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.940 
was left over from our plate making and
it<00:02:06.909> turned<00:02:07.179> into<00:02:07.359> a<00:02:07.509> rubber<00:02:08.049> stamp<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.769> has

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it turned into a rubber stamp that has

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.199 
it turned into a rubber stamp that has
so<00:02:09.310> many<00:02:09.459> fun<00:02:09.879> applications<00:02:12.239> okay<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.030> now

so many fun applications okay so now

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.990 
so many fun applications okay so now
that<00:02:16.239> I've<00:02:16.480> created<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.440> stems<00:02:17.860> I'm<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.879> to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
that I've created the stems I'm going to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.220 
that I've created the stems I'm going to
begin<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.450> create<00:02:19.780> my<00:02:20.019> flower<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.870> first

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
begin to create my flower now the first

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.800 
begin to create my flower now the first
step<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.769> creating<00:02:23.799> my<00:02:24.340> flower<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.360> ink<00:02:25.629> up

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
step in creating my flower is to ink up

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.809 
step in creating my flower is to ink up
the<00:02:25.870> stamp<00:02:26.349> with<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.099> straw<00:02:27.489> ink

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
the stamp with some of this straw ink

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.390 
the stamp with some of this straw ink
and<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.870> want<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.110> make<00:02:29.260> sure<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.680> have<00:02:29.860> good

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
and I want to make sure that I have good

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.180 
and I want to make sure that I have good
coverage<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.750> stamp<00:02:32.110> whenever<00:02:32.829> I<00:02:32.890> use<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
coverage on my stamp whenever I use a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.220 
coverage on my stamp whenever I use a
chunky<00:02:33.700> stamp<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.510> really<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.079> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
chunky stamp like this I really like the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.140 
chunky stamp like this I really like the
vivid<00:02:35.560> inks<00:02:35.890> because<00:02:36.190> they<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.579> lay<00:02:36.879> down<00:02:37.120> a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
vivid inks because they just lay down a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.420 
vivid inks because they just lay down a
beautiful<00:02:37.569> layer<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.170> ink<00:02:38.379> with<00:02:38.920> no<00:02:39.099> shading

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
beautiful layer of ink with no shading

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.009 
beautiful layer of ink with no shading
at<00:02:39.700> all<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:41.379> next<00:02:41.739> step<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:43.120> add<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.780> marker

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
at all the next step is to add a marker

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.020 
at all the next step is to add a marker
that's<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.500> little<00:02:44.739> bit<00:02:44.890> darker<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:45.879> this

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that's a little bit darker and in this

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.720 
that's a little bit darker and in this
case<00:02:46.329> i'm<00:02:46.660> using<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.500> memento<00:02:47.980> tangelo

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
case i'm using the memento tangelo

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.970 
case i'm using the memento tangelo
marker<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.319> see<00:02:50.590> what<00:02:50.709> i'm<00:02:50.829> going<00:02:50.920> to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150 
some of the rhubarb stock and I'm going
to<00:03:25.210> do<00:03:25.330> something<00:03:25.600> very<00:03:25.750> similar<00:03:26.320> I'm<00:03:26.710> going

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
to do something very similar I'm going

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.670 
to do something very similar I'm going
to<00:03:27.280> add<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:28.150> little<00:03:28.180> bit<00:03:28.780> below<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
to add just a little bit below the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.800 
to add just a little bit below the
orange<00:03:30.420> from<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> tangelo<00:03:31.960> marker<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:33.810> can

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
orange from the tangelo marker you can

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.450 
orange from the tangelo marker you can
see<00:03:35.140> I'm<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.260> doing<00:03:35.620> like<00:03:35.740> two<00:03:36.250> or<00:03:36.430> three

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
see I'm just doing like two or three

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:45.330 
see I'm just doing like two or three
little<00:03:36.970> lines<00:03:37.300> on<00:03:37.780> each<00:03:38.110> petal<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:44.190> then<00:03:45.190> just

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
little lines on each petal and then just

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.940 
little lines on each petal and then just
dabbing<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.820> little<00:03:46.030> bit<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.360> center<00:03:46.950> now

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
dabbing a little bit in the center now

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.160 
dabbing a little bit in the center now
my<00:03:48.130> next<00:03:48.370> step<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:48.940> huff<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.960> means

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
my next step is to huff and that means

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.400 
my next step is to huff and that means
to<00:03:50.470> breathe<00:03:51.130> moist<00:03:51.550> warm<00:03:52.150> air<00:03:52.480> onto<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.260> image

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
to breathe moist warm air onto the image

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.740 
to breathe moist warm air onto the image
because<00:03:54.340> some<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:54.850> ink<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.300> marker<00:03:55.600> has

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
because some of that ink and marker has

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.660 
because some of that ink and marker has
already<00:03:55.990> dried<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.740> want<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.040> reactivate

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
already dried so you want to reactivate

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.280 
already dried so you want to reactivate
it<00:03:57.970> by<00:03:58.000> using<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.570> little<00:03:58.780> bit<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.990> warm

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
it by using a little bit of warm

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.360 
it by using a little bit of warm
moisture<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:01.440> then<00:04:02.440> I'm<00:04:02.710> going<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.010> place

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
moisture and then I'm going to place

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.910 
moisture and then I'm going to place
that<00:04:04.680> stamp<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.950> exactly<00:04:06.960> onto<00:04:07.960> a<00:04:07.990> stem<00:04:08.440> like

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
that stamp that exactly onto a stem like

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.550 
that stamp that exactly onto a stem like
that<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.450> see<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.780> depth<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.230> get<00:04:11.410> in

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
that can you see the depth you get in

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.080 
that can you see the depth you get in
that<00:04:13.350> now<00:04:14.350> I'm<00:04:14.440> going<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.770> one<00:04:14.980> more<00:04:15.250> I'm

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
that now I'm going to do one more I'm

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.270 
that now I'm going to do one more I'm
going<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.870> clean<00:04:17.170> the<00:04:17.350> stamp<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:20.100> start<00:04:21.100> over

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
going to clean the stamp and start over

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.730 
going to clean the stamp and start over
again<00:04:22.620> inking<00:04:23.620> up<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.950> stamp<00:04:25.290> with<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.440> straw

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
again inking up the stamp with the straw

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.390 
again inking up the stamp with the straw
ink<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:28.350> then<00:04:29.350> adding<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.800> little<00:04:29.980> bit<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.220> the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
ink and then adding a little bit of the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:40.540 
ink and then adding a little bit of the
tangelo<00:04:30.880> marker

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.920 

and<00:04:40.640> then<00:04:41.420> a<00:04:42.520> little<00:04:43.520> bit<00:04:43.700> lower<00:04:44.090> on<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.540> pedal

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
and then a little bit lower on the pedal
