 naigral plenipotentiary seventies at 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.480
 tenths of the floor abdul ahad al farabi a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.870
 wide nineties and glamorous branches 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.450
 details of two thousandth need our reliability 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.360
 nets style but don't forget it is yours 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 last biggest scandal with 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.800
 retired spiritual 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 change in the past this time we even 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.030
 threatened style 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.900
 new league 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.170
 I am very clear and even the head of the movement 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.840
 I know that this style I will succeed 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.329
 best announced 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.560
 in Zaporozhye a real pro and most importantly 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.439
 learn beautifully for real if 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.029
 we were originally like very 

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:31.090
 positive effect on the spot 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.760
 prosecutors leaders imagine taken 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.200
 when I saw it I thought it where I am 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600
 hit 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.170
 know i can't imagine how we are 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 we will break break and war 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.250
 it will never happen true 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.430
 and sport is our last competition 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.990
 new wave 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.619
 we want to prove to the audience that you can 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.070
 anything is international 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 team and in another game 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.220
 but the basis for not showing higher 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.430
 aerobatics and get to the final 2 hours instead 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.320
 various presentations of his 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 team and more 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 d 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.469
 but it's good 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:16.829
 so workers 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.039
 per share we know what to say in connection with 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.279
 mister sparks 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.439
 great idea i got what you wanted 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.929
 show new beat out of rhythm 

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:28.499
 Ottawa ships constantly for example in parts 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.059
 james brown of the year no one showed 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:34.300
 good connections cook when it comes to 66 

00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:36.389
 who should be a strategist drawing 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.309
 dance too pumped up but I liked it 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:40.489
 how did you get out of kiev not to 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.539
 dance break and did in the market and 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.249
 robbed less air plumbing 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.740
 official opening of a memorable 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.849
 tea party schedule is nothing 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.080
 but in general the number broke the hand of ariadne 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.639
 a lot 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.370
 I have a feeling that you wanted 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.909
 hurry up 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.450
 marshy theater 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.720
 but traced one line but I 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.420
 I hope that Valera is right where needed 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.190
 it was a break portrayed by hand 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.820
 I thought okay and then we went back to 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.970
 their usual style showed higher 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.230
 aerobatics when girl white movement 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.409
 Alexander Lukashevich 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.709
 and a little part of the floor abdul you worked 

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.080
 Nastya became it was very winning 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.289
 moment 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.949
 nevertheless we are probably enough 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.999
 worked high and 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.169
 all the same it is a game and today the semi-final 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.919
 which determines the finalists 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.430
 we have to remember this is unclear right 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.539
 got that is life 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.379
 first I want to congratulate you we have reached 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.249
 before the semi-finals distinguish the case we 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.069
 see you phenomenon so i congratulate 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.069
 you with him 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.929
 without this team love drama writer 

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.539
 they are real actors and every time 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.779
 arrange the show I feel like satin 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.639
 energy comes in all the unusual that we 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.059
 seen this season khl yet this 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.409
 ikea team and know to the militia air and 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.499
 this is a unique one in the life of this 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.099
 I thought it was a very creative concept 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.629
 I always hear people say that your 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.360
 the team can not what others can 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.309
 fruits n 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:09.669
 but I want to say that the circles are definitely not 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.649
 the fact that a lot of these guys and I am glad that 

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:13.979
 are you here 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.930
 but I want to remind you that only 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.099
 one number and you should have struck everyone still 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.860
 so please do it 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.219
 but good 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.590
