00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 very good kids how are you and 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
 I hope I'm great perfectly 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome to a new video on my channel 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.090
 the other time we did 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.800
 comparing the fastest snipers 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.230
 and we discover which the sniper more 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.120
 fast of all call of duty now let's 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 do the same that what we will 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.119
 discover which is the sniper more 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.650
 slow we will do the same thing buying the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.170
 everything individually from each game and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 then all the slowest collective 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.580
 so, how are we going to start 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.380
 by the beginning to start with Carlos 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.449
 24 I already think you know the five 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 snipers pretty good we're going 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 to see on screen first 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.640
 individually now we see them in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.710
 collective if that we can in slow motion 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.329
 As you can see read reset 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.930
 hundred and the dragon ops are the two most 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.450
 slow that take 04 34 seconds let's go 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 already with carlos 25 with call of duty world 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.500
 at work we have also five 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.770
 sprint snipers signed without a win 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 and take pts and car 98 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 and we see here all buying in the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 screen like the sprint and it's the most 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.739
 slow that takes 0 with 5 seconds in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.210
 point past modern warfare 2 already 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.860
 we saw that the sniper wants her 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 faster than it was the neighborhood of the m 21 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.750
 we compared the 4 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.119
 as the intervention and the water 2000 are 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 the two slowest that take 03 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 Let's go now with call of duty 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.869
 black ops' 1 we have also 4 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.450
 sniper fears of 96 dragon of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 war 2 thousand and psg and we had bought the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.960
 again that the two above are the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.119
 two faster for we see as the psg and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.229
 the 2000 wow are the two slowest 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.140
 it takes 0.43 4 let's go with modern warfare 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.280
 3 that this game was quite curious already 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.259
 has seen and that we had 6 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.289
 snipers I think however the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.539
 6 took the same time to point the 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.119
 look whole and I was pretty curious 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.460
 it was quite interesting that everyone 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.679
 late in the same we passed already call of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.259
 duty black ops 2 that as you know we have 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.810
 four snipers lsv huelva list 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.429
 the dsr 50 and the team pr and also as 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.420
 the ballista was the fastest and the others 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.700
 three take the same 0.4 34 seconds 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 then this would be more or less like this 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.789
 of call of duty 4 we would stay with the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.310
 ere 700 of Carlos 25 we would stay with 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.600
 the springfield passing the albos 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.440
 sorry we would stay with the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.610
 intervention 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.020
 I always say when we have two 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.240
 snipers of the same time then 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.270
 select one of the white is one of 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.560
 selected the psg of the module for 3 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.300
 how everything takes the same thing can 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.360
 selected on l 11 by changing a bit 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.440
 for not putting back the msr and the black 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.810
 of all I have taken the psr is now worth the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.240
 we will compare all on display ar 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.380
 700 sprint end intervention psg l 11 and 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.510
 dsr we see everything on screen and the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.250
 we see in slow motion and I think that here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.750
 yes, it makes a difference 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.760
 we see how the last three 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.830
 sniper to shore 700 psg 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 and the csr when it was already targeted 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.880
 totally the sprint has not even been 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.180
 looks closer enough to 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.390
 to be able to shoot a shot we will not see it 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.100
 here when you finish pointing the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.940
 springfield which is more the slowest of 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.800
 all that takes 0.5 seconds so the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.470
 'prince' the slowest sniper in 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.720
 all the saga call of duty and the truth is 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.910
 not the likes that you left in the other 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.230
 video was a pass so pretty much 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.780
 appreciate 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.280
 the same the same support in this in this 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.980
 video because I had already seen shares of 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.019
 stupid because it's quite difficult is 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.569
 complicated of requires your time and good 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.099
 thank you for seeing video
