00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.819
 Welcome to her for the easter egg 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.799
 and we have to do that at least once 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.260
 be as golden gate bridge flown 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.110
 and it's about those blue skulls that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.299
 height there are five in the number and the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.369
 one can only always see cheeky mode 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.439
 but you do not have to be extra mode 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.380
 go in because I show you even the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 spots where these damages lie and the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.490
 the first is outside the dollar area 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.830
 and you need the hero called for that 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 the hell of arugula and just have to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.679
 throw this spot 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 the first one is pretty easy too 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.290
 get the second one is then going on picture 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 similar 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.370
 the second is here in the morning office and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.809
 He would have to look out of the window 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 this electricity post 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.969
 and there is the inlet and pretty 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 In the middle he is Thomas pattern 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.000
 maybe recharge a bit 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.829
 So just hold down the button 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.460
 or let go then it will 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.870
 a little further 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.320
 and then you have the second 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.780
 skulls get here in the ear to the office 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 So the number three schedl was the picture 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 finite and beautiful but three was on the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.939
 roof and fold so casually the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.830
 sequence like yours these skulls 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.330
 Collected does not matter 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.610
 and they are always the same 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.250
 spots to this point is up here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 this top of the roof but only 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.100
 throw it out and have it from the already 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 third skull not very much 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.970
 heavy 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.790
 the voerder is down at the docks 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.920
 the middle east of the bridge 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.280
 to see her here and it may be that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.070
 need to charge a little bit here 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 and yes as I said only damage right there 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 in the middle of three machines throw 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.850
 already promote skulls or fifth 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.490
 is also such a baroque on the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 lamp and I did it like that me 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 have charged alstom org and then I am 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.649
 jumped it around the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 It's a pity to come up there 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 but you can go up that lamp 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.369
 also do that your could use 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.740
 go up or down and then the gate 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.689
 then to this lamp who often so if you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.020
 could have collected these five skulls 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.270
 you then go to the office for murder and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.750
 on his 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 spit and japan flames from hell 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.000
 or what is where they should come from 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:18.140
 and then the brander money appears 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.489
 the wonder weapon of yum if they are the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.560
 beautiful city just so I think so 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.269
 not bad and you have to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.519
 record, and then he says a watchman 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.900
 coming for you are able to be in 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.200
 German always thinks I become completely 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.390
 come 87 2 b what train too 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.360
 agreed the last part comes then 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.620
 soon, too , maybe one 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.510
 a bit longer and I think 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.319

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.319
