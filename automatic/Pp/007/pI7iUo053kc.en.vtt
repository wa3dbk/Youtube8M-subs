00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
yeah I noticed something that the two

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.629 
yeah I noticed something that the two
over<00:04:05.040> there<00:04:05.250> they<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.389> red<00:04:06.659> coating<00:04:07.639> just

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
over there they have a red coating just

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.339 
over there they have a red coating just
hung<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:08.969> here<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:10.159> green<00:04:11.159> and<00:04:12.019> these<00:04:13.019> two

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
hung over here is green and these two

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.490 
hung over here is green and these two
over<00:04:13.530> here<00:04:13.790> have<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:15.269> green<00:04:15.719> and<00:04:15.750> red<00:04:16.019> coating

over here have a green and red coating

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.400 
over here have a green and red coating
I'm<00:04:16.769> not<00:04:17.039> sure<00:04:17.340> I'll<00:04:17.849> just<00:04:18.060> green<00:04:18.299> one<00:04:18.570> that's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
I'm not sure I'll just green one that's

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.640 
I'm not sure I'll just green one that's
an<00:04:19.530> outsider<00:04:19.979> plant<00:04:20.549> or<00:04:20.759> whatever<00:04:21.320> like<00:04:22.320> if<00:04:22.470> it

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
an outsider plant or whatever like if it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.990 
an outsider plant or whatever like if it
was<00:04:23.690> an<00:04:24.690> extra<00:04:25.169> spore<00:04:25.620> from<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.160> outside<00:04:26.639> that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
was an extra spore from the outside that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.930 
was an extra spore from the outside that
got<00:04:27.180> in<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.630> guess<00:04:28.470> I'll<00:04:28.650> just<00:04:28.800> have<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.009> see<00:04:29.280> but

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
got in I guess I'll just have to see but

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.200 
got in I guess I'll just have to see but
I<00:04:30.389> don't<00:04:31.139> know

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.760 

let<00:04:35.720> me<00:04:35.780> see<00:04:35.900> if<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.020> can<00:04:36.169> think<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.530> anything

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
let me see if I can think of anything

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:45.670 
let me see if I can think of anything
else<00:04:37.009> to<00:04:37.100> say<00:04:37.280> before<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.639> close<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.530> I

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
else to say before I close this and I

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.850 
else to say before I close this and I
think<00:04:45.919> that's<00:04:46.160> pretty<00:04:46.639> much<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.120> for<00:04:47.389> now

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
think that's pretty much it for now

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.810 
think that's pretty much it for now
before<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:48.889> had<00:04:49.190> noticed<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.699> they<00:04:49.880> were<00:04:49.910> like

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
before I had noticed that they were like

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.950 
before I had noticed that they were like
this<00:04:52.820> dream<00:04:53.120> dot<00:04:53.330> over<00:04:53.449> here

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
this dream dot over here

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.290 
this dream dot over here
I<00:04:53.990> thought<00:04:54.889> it<00:04:55.100> was<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.460> C's<00:04:55.639> I<00:04:55.820> like<00:04:55.970> just

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
I thought it was on the C's I like just

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.230 
I thought it was on the C's I like just
grew<00:04:56.600> big<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.740> turns<00:04:57.949> out<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:59.000> the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
grew big it turns out that it's just the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.920 
grew big it turns out that it's just the
compost<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.900> I<00:04:59.960> put<00:05:00.259> in<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:05.180> eucalyptus<00:05:05.780> is

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
compost that I put in this eucalyptus is

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.580 
compost that I put in this eucalyptus is
really<00:05:06.320> easy<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.560> grow<00:05:06.860> by<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.639> looks<00:05:07.880> of<00:05:08.030> it

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
really easy to grow by the looks of it

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.980 
really easy to grow by the looks of it
yeah<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.919> have<00:05:10.400> not<00:05:10.610> done<00:05:10.940> anything<00:05:11.539> to<00:05:11.780> it

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
yeah I have not done anything to it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.550 
yeah I have not done anything to it
besides<00:05:12.199> watering<00:05:12.889> it<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:14.199> not<00:05:15.199> even<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.530> I

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
besides watering it and not even that I

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.430 
besides watering it and not even that I
only<00:05:15.860> watered<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.280> like<00:05:17.860> maybe<00:05:20.289> three<00:05:21.289> or<00:05:21.320> four

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
only watered it like maybe three or four

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.640 
only watered it like maybe three or four
out<00:05:22.009> of<00:05:22.039> the<00:05:22.400> eight<00:05:22.550> days<00:05:23.259> once<00:05:24.259> every<00:05:24.500> two

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
out of the eight days once every two

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:32.740 
out of the eight days once every two
days<00:05:24.800> something<00:05:25.070> like<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.460> maybe<00:05:26.120> even<00:05:26.449> less

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.150
