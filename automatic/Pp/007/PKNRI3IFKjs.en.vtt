00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
that can handle the hype I think he can

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.250 
that can handle the hype I think he can
my<00:04:41.700> impression<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.539> you<00:04:43.110> know<00:04:43.229> people

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
my impression is that you know people

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.200 
my impression is that you know people
compare<00:04:43.919> him<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.039> LeBron<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.729> he's<00:04:45.000> heard

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
compare him to LeBron and he's heard

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.360 
compare him to LeBron and he's heard
that<00:04:45.419> comparison<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.320> he<00:04:46.440> thinks<00:04:46.740> it's<00:04:46.890> you

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
that comparison and he thinks it's you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.490 
that comparison and he thinks it's you
know<00:04:47.460> over<00:04:47.789> exaggerated<00:04:48.510> but<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.320> name

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
know over exaggerated but the one name

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.170 
know over exaggerated but the one name
that<00:04:49.710> kept<00:04:49.890> coming<00:04:49.919> up<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.400> our<00:04:50.520> conversations

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
that kept coming up in our conversations

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.820 
that kept coming up in our conversations
was<00:04:51.360> always<00:04:51.600> Kevin<00:04:51.870> during<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:52.350> think

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
was always Kevin during it I think

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.800 
was always Kevin during it I think
personality-wise<00:04:53.430> he<00:04:53.789> sees<00:04:54.000> himself<00:04:54.180> as<00:04:54.570> much

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
personality-wise he sees himself as much

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.690 
personality-wise he sees himself as much
more<00:04:55.110> like<00:04:55.350> Kevin<00:04:55.919> Durant<00:04:56.010> off<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.430> court

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
more like Kevin Durant off the court

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.219 
more like Kevin Durant off the court
he'll<00:04:56.880> never<00:04:57.060> call<00:04:57.360> himself<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.780> global<00:04:58.140> icon

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
he'll never call himself a global icon

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.650 
he'll never call himself a global icon
but<00:04:59.160> also<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.550> think<00:04:59.760> he<00:05:00.030> wants<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.270> be<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.479> kind

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
but also I think he wants to be the kind

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.120 
but also I think he wants to be the kind
of<00:05:00.720> score<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.020> Kevin<00:05:01.470> Durant<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.070> be

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
of score that Kevin Durant is and be

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.800 
of score that Kevin Durant is and be
able<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.400> get<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.850> shot<00:05:03.120> from<00:05:03.210> anywhere<00:05:03.570> on<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
able to get a shot from anywhere on the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.270 
able to get a shot from anywhere on the
court<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.140> really<00:05:04.289> be<00:05:04.740> able<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.039> pull<00:05:05.190> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
court and really be able to pull the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.950 
court and really be able to pull the
trigger<00:05:05.460> quickly<00:05:05.970> what<00:05:06.330> are<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.600> kinds<00:05:06.900> of

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
trigger quickly what are the kinds of

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.620 
trigger quickly what are the kinds of
things<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.830> one<00:05:08.190> years

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
things that in one years

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.350 
things that in one years
time<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.170> coaches<00:05:09.590> hope<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.070> improve<00:05:10.610> with

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
time the coaches hope to improve with

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.630 
time the coaches hope to improve with
andrew<00:05:11.720> wiggins<00:05:11.930> yeah<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.800> think<00:05:13.130> one<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.490> the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
andrew wiggins yeah I think one of the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.890 
andrew wiggins yeah I think one of the
things<00:05:13.790> that<00:05:13.970> they've<00:05:14.120> discussed<00:05:14.570> is<00:05:14.750> they

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
things that they've discussed is they

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.780 
things that they've discussed is they
want<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.200> improve<00:05:15.500> his<00:05:15.770> shot<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.490> they<00:05:16.610> want

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790

want to improve his shot and they want
improve<00:05:17.060> his<00:05:17.210> defense<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.870> know<00:05:18.290> having<00:05:18.710> him

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
improve his defense you know having him

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.200 
improve his defense you know having him
come<00:05:19.010> off<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.310> screens<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.790> they<00:05:19.850> set<00:05:20.180> for

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
come off the screens that they set for

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.090 
come off the screens that they set for
Ben<00:05:20.510> McLemore<00:05:20.720> last<00:05:21.230> year<00:05:21.470> they're<00:05:21.890> looking

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
Ben McLemore last year they're looking

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.980 
Ben McLemore last year they're looking
to<00:05:22.130> have<00:05:22.340> him<00:05:22.580> fill<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.000> role<00:05:23.210> immediately

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
to have him fill that role immediately

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.330 
to have him fill that role immediately
and<00:05:24.230> they<00:05:24.560> can't<00:05:24.830> have<00:05:25.010> them<00:05:25.160> out<00:05:25.310> there

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
and they can't have them out there

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.250 
and they can't have them out there
hidden<00:05:25.730> outside<00:05:26.180> shots<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:26.750> if<00:05:26.960> it's<00:05:27.110> not

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
hidden outside shots and if it's not

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260 
hidden outside shots and if it's not
consistent<00:05:27.620> but<00:05:28.280> I<00:05:28.340> think<00:05:28.520> also<00:05:28.700> defense

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
consistent but I think also defense

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.630 
consistent but I think also defense
because<00:05:29.570> he's<00:05:29.720> so<00:05:29.900> fast<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:30.770> long<00:05:31.010> there

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
because he's so fast and so long there

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.220 
because he's so fast and so long there
wouldn't<00:05:31.970> be<00:05:32.000> an<00:05:32.150> excuse<00:05:32.570> for<00:05:32.690> him<00:05:32.810> not<00:05:32.990> being

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
wouldn't be an excuse for him not being

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.500 
wouldn't be an excuse for him not being
a<00:05:33.290> good<00:05:33.410> defender<00:05:33.740> what<00:05:34.490> is<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:34.730> like<00:05:34.970> for<00:05:35.300> him

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
a good defender what is it like for him

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.620 
a good defender what is it like for him
