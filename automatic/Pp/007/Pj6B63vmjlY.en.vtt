important for the fence the games with
Seattle<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.739> Portland<00:00:40.860> over<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> years<00:00:41.370> have

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
Seattle and Portland over the years have

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
Seattle and Portland over the years have
just<00:00:41.579> been<00:00:41.879> awesome<00:00:42.450> most<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> matches

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.399 
believe that as a football supporter you
have<00:01:53.909> an<00:01:54.000> opportunity<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.600> impact<00:01:55.110> what's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
have an opportunity to impact what's

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.710 
have an opportunity to impact what's
going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> happen<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.640> ground<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.060> have

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
going to happen in the ground you have

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.059 
going to happen in the ground you have
an<00:01:57.810> opportunity<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.259> impact<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.009> to

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
an opportunity to impact was going to

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.340 
an opportunity to impact was going to
happen<00:01:59.759> on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> field<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.959> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.229> that's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
happen on the field and I think that's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
happen on the field and I think that's
one<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> biggest<00:02:01.799> things<00:02:02.039> for<00:02:02.100> me<00:02:02.310> being<00:02:02.850> a
