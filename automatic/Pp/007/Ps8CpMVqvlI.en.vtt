already<00:02:00.039> have<00:02:00.340> listed<00:02:00.700> here<00:02:00.729> actually<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.740> so

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
already have listed here actually and so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.730 
already have listed here actually and so
I<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:04.299> market<00:02:04.869> value<00:02:04.899> here<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.500> pretty

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
a pretty good deal so I'm actually going

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
a pretty good deal so I'm actually going
to<00:02:12.400> go<00:02:12.460> ahead<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.790> buy<00:02:12.820> all<00:02:13.209> these<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:14.560> let's

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
to go ahead and buy all these now let's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.000 
to go ahead and buy all these now let's
see<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.310> two<00:02:15.550> three<00:02:16.120> four<00:02:16.390> five<00:02:16.420> six

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
see a one two three four five six

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.390 
see a one two three four five six
and<00:02:18.129> looks<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:18.879> eight<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:20.409> just<00:02:20.920> really

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and looks like eight and so just really

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.479 
and looks like eight and so just really
quick<00:02:21.640> math<00:02:21.849> here<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.799> cell<00:02:23.799> is<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.129> I<00:02:24.250> said

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
quick math here I cell is like I said

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.729 
quick math here I cell is like I said
for<00:02:25.680> 28.5<00:02:26.680> gold<00:02:27.120> afterwards<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.739> looking

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
for 28.5 gold afterwards and looking

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.580 
for 28.5 gold afterwards and looking
like<00:02:29.829> these<00:02:30.099> are<00:02:30.280> about<00:02:30.700> 22<00:02:31.150> or<00:02:31.269> 21<00:02:31.720> 19<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.349> guess

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
like these are about 22 or 21 19 I guess

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.130 
like these are about 22 or 21 19 I guess
and<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:33.849> we<00:02:34.000> figure<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.420> have<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.599> six<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.079> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
and so if we figure I have a six and a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.530 
and so if we figure I have a six and a
half<00:02:35.170> gold<00:02:35.590> profit<00:02:36.159> per<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.209> too<00:02:37.390> bad

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
half gold profit per it's not too bad

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.160 
half gold profit per it's not too bad
six<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> half<00:02:38.769> gold<00:02:39.220> times<00:02:39.610> eight<00:02:40.299> we're

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
six and a half gold times eight we're

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.030 
six and a half gold times eight we're
looking<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.650> about<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.819> real<00:02:45.970> quick

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.920 

looking<00:02:51.040> at<00:02:51.129> about<00:02:51.250> 52<00:02:51.790> gold<00:02:52.150> profit<00:02:52.569> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
looking at about 52 gold profit and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.319 
looking at about 52 gold profit and
that's<00:02:53.470> really<00:02:53.769> not<00:02:53.859> too<00:02:54.040> bad<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:55.030> I'm<00:02:55.299> going

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
that's really not too bad so I'm going

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.910 
that's really not too bad so I'm going
to<00:02:55.480> go<00:02:55.599> ahead<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:55.840> pull<00:02:56.230> those<00:02:56.379> out<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.680> my

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920

hey granted i may not be able to sell
these<00:03:08.560> right<00:03:08.799> away<00:03:08.829> but<00:03:09.870> knowing<00:03:10.870> what<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.079> know

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
these right away but knowing what I know

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.680 
these right away but knowing what I know
about<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.590> auction<00:03:11.889> house<00:03:12.010> price<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.609> know<00:03:13.510> I'm

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
about the auction house price I know I'm

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
anything else I think that is probably

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.800 
anything else I think that is probably
the<00:03:19.780> most<00:03:19.810> important<00:03:20.620> fundamental<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:22.060> you

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the most important fundamental that you

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.629 
the most important fundamental that you
can<00:03:22.989> learn<00:03:23.109> about<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.410> auction<00:03:23.769> house<00:03:23.949> it's

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
can learn about the auction house it's

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.939 
can learn about the auction house it's
not<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.419> much<00:03:25.480> about<00:03:25.629> knowing<00:03:26.290> every<00:03:26.590> single

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
not so much about knowing every single

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.069 
not so much about knowing every single
item<00:03:27.099> every<00:03:27.669> day<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.419> can<00:03:28.690> go<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:29.049> and

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
item every day that you can go in and

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.809 
item every day that you can go in and
buy<00:03:29.949> and<00:03:30.340> sell<00:03:30.849> it's<00:03:31.690> about<00:03:32.819> understanding

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
buy and sell it's about understanding

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.119 
buy and sell it's about understanding
that<00:03:34.510> model<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:34.989> understanding<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.829> you

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
that model and understanding that you

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.879 
that model and understanding that you
can<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:36.430> with<00:03:36.639> any<00:03:37.389> product<00:03:37.810> with<00:03:38.199> any<00:03:38.410> market

this is the point I really want to try

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.059 
this is the point I really want to try
and<00:03:43.209> get<00:03:43.299> across<00:03:43.569> because<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.349> it's<00:03:44.829> so

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
is just something I've slowly

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.070 
is just something I've slowly
accumulated<00:05:36.160> over<00:05:36.310> time<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.030> have<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.210> really

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
and once I was able to gain

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.130 
and once I was able to gain
understanding<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.880> was<00:05:43.390> really<00:05:43.600> able<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.960> just

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
understanding I was really able to just

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.200 
understanding I was really able to just
see<00:05:44.320> this<00:05:44.500> type<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:44.770> strategy<00:05:45.130> explode<00:05:45.820> for<00:05:46.060> me

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
of gold every day using it and so it's

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.590
