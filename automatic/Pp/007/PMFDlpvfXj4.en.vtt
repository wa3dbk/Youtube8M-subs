00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello friends welcome here 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.420
 to the tank simulator 15 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.599
 you do not have to be a clairvoyant around 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.670
 here to see that here this device 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.789
 has nothing to do with dvds 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:28.619
 but not everything he won 70 years ago 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 Russia about Nazi Germany woman so 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 The bales always film so fast 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 on the occasion of the victory as I said 70 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.489
 years Russia left over Nazi 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 Germany's here this ptr 80 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.289
 Russian transport toned conditional 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.360
 from in russia must confess honestly 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.160
 the model is so bad I have to 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.120
 say the light is also there 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.770
 friends 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.090
 we do not have a horn or blinkers 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.079
 inside friends we do not have us 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 have these tours under 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 quotation marks view the ball yet 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.650
 can shoot again found too 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 not that is maybe prettier 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.689
 driving behavior is htcs of evil but it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.970
 Yes, it's about the victory like here 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.430
 said from russia about 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.040
 Nazi Germany and for 15 minutes fun 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.659
 right in any case that was it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.490
 again it does not give us anything 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 This device is emotionally consistent 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.509
 show we are now only very briefly 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.689
 look into the block error here 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.600
 does claude resources really like that? 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 tragic otherwise there was no mistake and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.579
 shop.com would look here 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.890
 propose under marks mazda stands ppr 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.960
 and costs 20,000 euros and 66 ps so 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.540
 that definitely comes before 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.610
 treat yourself if you like that and something like that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.950
 also want to be a profession as I said the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.140
 Lok error is definitely not that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 problem 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 that's about it again says 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.320
 thank you for seeing and this 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.070
 immediately in the app store again 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.070
