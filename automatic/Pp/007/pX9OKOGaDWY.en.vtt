going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> explain<00:00:45.120> everything<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.780> have

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
going to explain everything that I have

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.780 
going to explain everything that I have
in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> plane<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> end<00:00:47.400> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> video

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
in the plane and at the end of the video

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.570 
in the plane and at the end of the video
I<00:00:48.090> said<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> nothing<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:49.140> stalking<00:00:49.470> that<00:00:50.370> is

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
I said that nothing was stalking that is

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.540 
I said that nothing was stalking that is
indeed<00:00:50.940> true<00:00:51.290> so<00:00:52.290> we'll<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.220> through<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
indeed true so we'll just go through the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.370 
indeed true so we'll just go through the
various<00:00:53.820> parts<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> try<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.320> move

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
various parts here and try and move

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.160 
various parts here and try and move
along<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:55.830> there's<00:00:56.040> quite<00:00:56.310> a<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.240> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
along because there's quite a bit and to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.540 
along because there's quite a bit and to
start<00:00:58.380> off<00:00:58.560> with<00:00:58.800> we'll<00:00:59.040> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
start off with we'll have a look at the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.980 
start off with we'll have a look at the
motor<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.000> I'll<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.540> cow<00:01:00.690> alot

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
motor so I'll just take the cow alot

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.080 
motor so I'll just take the cow alot
okay<00:01:01.560> here<00:01:01.830> it<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.950> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.520> flight<00:01:02.790> power

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
okay here it is this is a flight power

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
okay here it is this is a flight power
tan<00:01:03.540> motor<00:01:03.870> system<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.580> actually

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
tan motor system and I don't actually

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.050 
tan motor system and I don't actually
have<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> box<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.750> me<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:07.170> but

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
have the box with me right now but

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
have the box with me right now but
that's<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> name<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:09.930> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's the name of the thing this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.999 
that's the name of the thing this
spinner<00:01:11.220> comes<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.840> motor<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
spinner comes with the motor that you

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.460 
spinner comes with the motor that you
see<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.630> motor<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:16.080> fairly

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
see right here and this motor I'm fairly

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.569 
see right here and this motor I'm fairly
sure<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.040> putting<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> well<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.829> minimum<00:01:19.829> would

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
sure is putting out well a minimum would

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.840 
sure is putting out well a minimum would
be<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.880> excess<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.740> 300<00:01:22.740> Watts<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.579> be<00:01:23.700> my

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
be in excess of 300 Watts would be my

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.859 
be in excess of 300 Watts would be my
guess<00:01:24.179> and<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:27.119> way<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> spinner<00:01:27.689> it's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
guess and the way the spinner it's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
guess and the way the spinner it's
actually<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.409> simple<00:01:28.649> setup<00:01:28.999> it<00:01:29.999> just

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
actually really simple setup it just

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.359 
actually really simple setup it just
goes<00:01:30.450> over<00:01:30.479> top<00:01:30.929> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.590> prop<00:01:31.829> shaft

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
goes over top of the prop shaft

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.260 
goes over top of the prop shaft
okay<00:01:33.270> here's<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> finish<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:35.270> all

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
okay here's what the finish like all

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.559 
okay here's what the finish like all
taken<00:01:36.689> off<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
taken off you see right here when the

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.590 
taken off you see right here when the
propeller<00:01:39.899> is<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.679> in<00:01:41.060> only<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
propeller is actually in only on this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.649 
propeller is actually in only on this
shaft<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:44.189> tension<00:01:44.609> between<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
shaft the tension between this bit and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
shaft the tension between this bit and
this<00:01:45.929> bit<00:01:46.670> squeezes<00:01:48.109> these<00:01:49.109> little<00:01:49.670> whatever

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
this bit squeezes these little whatever

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
this bit squeezes these little whatever
you<00:01:50.789> want<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.090> call<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.420> things<00:01:51.929> together

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you want to call them things together

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
you want to call them things together
onto<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> propeller<00:01:53.939> shaft<00:01:54.619> right<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:56.600> now

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
onto the propeller shaft right there now

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
onto the propeller shaft right there now
this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.259> reason<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.579> really

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this is a reason that it's really

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.789 
this is a reason that it's really
essential<00:02:00.179> that<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.200> fit<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
essential that you have a good fit for a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730 
essential that you have a good fit for a
propeller<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.869> tension<00:02:04.619> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
propeller because that tension that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.859 
propeller because that tension that
you're<00:02:04.859> going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.039> have<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.420> ability<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you're going to have and the ability to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.010 
you're going to have and the ability to
hang<00:02:07.139> on<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> motor<00:02:09.000> shaft<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.690> really

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
hang on to the motor shaft is really

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410 
hang on to the motor shaft is really
dependent<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.979> propeller<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.760> sit<00:02:12.390> over

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
dependent on the propeller to sit over

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
dependent on the propeller to sit over
there<00:02:12.750> perfectly<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.400> brings<00:02:14.610> us<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
there perfectly so that brings us to the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.170 
there perfectly so that brings us to the
propeller<00:02:15.890> which<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:19.020> PC<00:02:19.640> 12<00:02:20.640> by<00:02:20.850> 6

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
propeller which is in a PC 12 by 6

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.390 
propeller which is in a PC 12 by 6
electric<00:02:22.080> prop

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
electric prop

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.229 
electric prop
and<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.650> 12<00:02:25.920> by<00:02:26.010> 6e<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.489> believe<00:02:26.939> what<00:02:27.120> it's

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
and the 12 by 6e I believe what it's

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.270 
and the 12 by 6e I believe what it's
called<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.890> very

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
called and this is like it's very

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.610 
called and this is like it's very
perfect<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.510> setup<00:02:30.900> because<00:02:31.379> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
perfect for this setup because the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.009 
perfect for this setup because the
diameter<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> inside<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.780> shaft

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
diameter on the inside of the shaft

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.929 
diameter on the inside of the shaft
itself<00:02:34.459> or<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.640> shaft<00:02:35.909> hole<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.370> perfect

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
itself or the shaft hole is a perfect

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.460 
itself or the shaft hole is a perfect
fit<00:02:39.180> right<00:02:39.390> off<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.370> I'll<00:02:41.370> try<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.260> zoom<00:02:43.260> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
fit right off and I'll try and zoom in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.460 
fit right off and I'll try and zoom in
so<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.599> on<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.870> propeller<00:02:46.260> here

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so you can see on the propeller here

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.789 
so you can see on the propeller here
you'll<00:02:46.680> see<00:02:46.890> there's<00:02:47.090> hopefully<00:02:48.090> an<00:02:48.799> extra

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
you'll see there's hopefully an extra

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.640 
you'll see there's hopefully an extra
ring<00:02:50.069> right<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:51.030> which<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.349> sort<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
ring right here which is just sort of a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.430 
ring right here which is just sort of a
little<00:02:52.890> rise<00:02:53.129> where<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.489> widens

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
little rise where it widens

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.680 
little rise where it widens
unfortunately<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> fits<00:02:55.950> perfectly<00:02:56.690> right

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
unfortunately that fits perfectly right

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.580 
unfortunately that fits perfectly right
inside<00:02:58.079> this<00:02:58.379> extra<00:02:59.310> notch<00:02:59.489> here<00:03:00.079> so<00:03:01.079> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
inside this extra notch here so it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.319 
inside this extra notch here so it
really<00:03:01.620> couldn't<00:03:02.129> get<00:03:02.310> any<00:03:02.519> better<00:03:02.670> for<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> fit

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
really couldn't get any better for a fit

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.089 
really couldn't get any better for a fit
without<00:03:03.780> even<00:03:04.049> being<00:03:04.139> modified<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.889> any<00:03:04.950> way

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
without even being modified in any way

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.470 
without even being modified in any way
so<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:05.639> what<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.879> would<00:03:06.000> definitely

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
so this is what I would definitely

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.860 
so this is what I would definitely
recommend<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.139> a<00:03:07.799> propeller<00:03:08.189> APC<00:03:09.150> 12<00:03:09.420> by<00:03:09.569> 6

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
recommend for a propeller APC 12 by 6

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.660 
recommend for a propeller APC 12 by 6
and<00:03:10.109> it's<00:03:10.620> right<00:03:10.829> around<00:03:10.950> perfect<00:03:11.519> for

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and it's right around perfect for

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.260 
and it's right around perfect for
performance

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.550 

so<00:03:14.840> then<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.140> motor<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:15.650> mounted<00:03:16.060> by<00:03:17.060> just<00:03:17.560> you

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so then the motor is mounted by just you

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.130 
so then the motor is mounted by just you
can<00:03:18.740> see<00:03:18.950> here<00:03:19.220> these<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:20.540> wooden<00:03:20.870> block

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
can see here these this wooden block

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.200 
can see here these this wooden block
right<00:03:21.410> here<00:03:21.520> which<00:03:22.520> is<00:03:22.550> actually<00:03:22.820> screw

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
right here which is actually screw

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.730 
right here which is actually screw
directly<00:03:23.360> into<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.960> firewall<00:03:24.500> using<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.550> old

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
directly into the firewall using the old

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.080 
directly into the firewall using the old
plate<00:03:27.740> without<00:03:27.890> shaving<00:03:28.340> much<00:03:28.640> off<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.060> that

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
plate without shaving much off so that

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.300 
plate without shaving much off so that
you<00:03:29.270> still<00:03:29.480> get<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.690> little<00:03:29.810> bit<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.110> angle<00:03:31.010> to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
you still get a little bit of angle to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.050 
you still get a little bit of angle to
counteract<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> torque<00:03:32.890> it's<00:03:33.890> not<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.940> be

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
counteract the torque it's not to be

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.480 
counteract the torque it's not to be
honest<00:03:35.450> quite<00:03:35.720> enough<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.920> not<00:03:37.130> hard<00:03:37.370> to

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
honest quite enough but it's not hard to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.850 
honest quite enough but it's not hard to
compensate<00:03:37.790> with<00:03:38.090> aileron<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.740> then<00:03:39.740> the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
compensate with aileron and then the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.060 
compensate with aileron and then the
motor<00:03:40.070> wires<00:03:40.370> just<00:03:40.970> run<00:03:41.210> back<00:03:41.420> in<00:03:41.690> here<00:03:42.110> which

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
motor wires just run back in here which

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.860 
motor wires just run back in here which
will<00:03:43.280> then<00:03:43.430> bring<00:03:43.910> us<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.270> speed<00:03:44.510> control

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
will then bring us to the speed control

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.770 
will then bring us to the speed control
okay<00:03:45.200> under<00:03:45.560> here<00:03:45.770> we<00:03:45.980> see<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:47.120> receiver

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
okay under here we see the receiver

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.050 
okay under here we see the receiver
speed<00:03:48.380> controller<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.250> few<00:03:49.430> servo<00:03:49.700> wires

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
speed controller and a few servo wires

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.780 
speed controller and a few servo wires
and<00:03:50.360> things<00:03:50.510> like<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.430> now<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.490> speed

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
and things like that now the speed

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.840 
and things like that now the speed
controller<00:03:53.240> is<00:03:53.510> actually<00:03:54.110> still<00:03:54.410> stock<00:03:54.850> the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
controller is actually still stock the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.290 
controller is actually still stock the
25<00:03:56.360> amp<00:03:56.630> speed<00:03:57.140> controller<00:03:57.620> by<00:03:58.550> e-flite<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.270> I

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
25 amp speed controller by e-flite so I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.640 
25 amp speed controller by e-flite so I
guess<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.630> was<00:03:59.780> incorrect<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.410> saying

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
guess I was incorrect and saying

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.230 
guess I was incorrect and saying
everything<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.520> stock<00:04:01.790> but<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.060> would

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
everything is in stock but I would

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.910 
everything is in stock but I would
actually<00:04:02.450> recommend<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.260> if<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.560> do<00:04:03.740> this

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
actually recommend that if you do this

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.860 
actually recommend that if you do this
that<00:04:04.520> you<00:04:04.640> move<00:04:04.850> up<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> slightly<00:04:05.540> bigger

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
that you move up to a slightly bigger

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.000 
that you move up to a slightly bigger
speed<00:04:06.230> controller<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.950> say<00:04:07.720> well<00:04:08.920> I'll<00:04:09.920> have

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
speed controller like say well I'll have

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.920 
speed controller like say well I'll have
a<00:04:10.070> watt<00:04:10.370> meter<00:04:10.400> before<00:04:10.820> too<00:04:11.180> long<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.840> then

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
a watt meter before too long and then

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.510 
a watt meter before too long and then
I'll<00:04:12.050> let<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.380> know<00:04:12.410> on<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.770> video<00:04:13.040> how<00:04:13.310> many

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
I'll let you know on the video how many

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.430 
I'll let you know on the video how many
watts<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:14.000> system<00:04:14.330> is<00:04:14.420> actually<00:04:14.570> drawing<00:04:15.020> and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
watts the system is actually drawing and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.740 
watts the system is actually drawing and
then<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.010> can<00:04:16.310> confirm<00:04:16.700> whether<00:04:17.420> you<00:04:17.600> should

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
then I can confirm whether you should

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.300 
then I can confirm whether you should
get<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:18.049> third<00:04:18.380> year<00:04:18.680> 40<00:04:19.220> amp<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:21.310> anyway

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
get like a third year 40 amp but anyway

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.830 
get like a third year 40 amp but anyway
I've<00:04:22.460> moved<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.850> speed<00:04:23.150> controller<00:04:23.510> back

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
I've moved the speed controller back

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.520 
I've moved the speed controller back
here<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.650> try<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:24.940> give<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:25.970> more<00:04:26.300> tailored<00:04:26.660> CG

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
here to try and give a more tailored CG

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.260 
here to try and give a more tailored CG
which<00:04:27.740> is<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:28.100> find<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:28.730> always<00:04:28.910> been<00:04:29.180> an

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
which is I find it's always been an

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.820 
which is I find it's always been an
issue<00:04:29.450> with<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:29.870> airplane<00:04:30.140> if<00:04:30.530> you've<00:04:30.680> owned

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
issue with this airplane if you've owned

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.640 
issue with this airplane if you've owned
it<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:30.980> probably<00:04:31.280> know<00:04:31.490> -<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.290> even<00:04:33.290> now<00:04:33.470> it

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
it you probably know - and even now it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.550 
it you probably know - and even now it
could<00:04:33.830> use<00:04:33.980> more<00:04:34.010> weight<00:04:34.910> in<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.060> tail<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:35.630> to

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
could use more weight in the tail but to

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.410 
could use more weight in the tail but to
be<00:04:36.680> honest<00:04:36.980> it's<00:04:37.130> not<00:04:37.280> really<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.730> best<00:04:37.940> 3d

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
be honest it's not really the best 3d

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.260 
be honest it's not really the best 3d
airplane<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.110> world<00:04:39.170> anyway<00:04:39.830> so<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.730> didn't

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
airplane in the world anyway so I didn't

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.880 
airplane in the world anyway so I didn't
worry<00:04:41.450> too<00:04:41.660> much<00:04:41.690> about<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.170> better<00:04:42.770> off

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
worry too much about that better off

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.530 
worry too much about that better off
just<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.220> get<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> better<00:04:43.610> 3d<00:04:43.910> airplane<00:04:44.420> if

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
just to get a better 3d airplane if

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.570 
just to get a better 3d airplane if
that's<00:04:44.690> what<00:04:44.810> you're<00:04:44.930> really<00:04:45.080> looking<00:04:45.350> for<00:04:45.710> so

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
that's what you're really looking for so

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.240 
that's what you're really looking for so
I<00:04:46.610> just<00:04:46.880> use<00:04:47.060> these<00:04:47.270> extensions<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:48.350> run<00:04:48.530> from

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
I just use these extensions to run from

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.430 
I just use these extensions to run from
the<00:04:49.400> motor<00:04:49.780> where<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.870> speed<00:04:51.110> controller

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
the motor where the speed controller

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.440 
the motor where the speed controller
used<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.890> sit<00:04:52.070> up<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.700> back<00:04:52.880> here<00:04:53.180> which<00:04:53.330> I

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
used to sit up to back here which I

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.790 
used to sit up to back here which I
hollowed<00:04:53.840> out<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.990> little<00:04:54.260> just<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.500> fit<00:04:54.680> the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
hollowed out a little just to fit the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.590 
hollowed out a little just to fit the
controller<00:04:55.130> in<00:04:55.340> here<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.730> then<00:04:55.850> put<00:04:56.390> all<00:04:56.420> the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
controller in here and then put all the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.650 
controller in here and then put all the
wires<00:04:56.810> together<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.380> zip-tied<00:04:57.920> them<00:04:58.130> and

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
wires together and zip-tied them and

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.170 
wires together and zip-tied them and
bury<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.750> under<00:05:00.020> here<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:00.410> can<00:05:00.590> see<00:05:01.180> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
bury it under here you can see the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.370 
bury it under here you can see the
spectrum<00:05:04.150> 6200<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.690> believe<00:05:06.140> that's

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
spectrum 6200 is that I believe that's

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.580 
spectrum 6200 is that I believe that's
what<00:05:06.560> it's<00:05:06.680> called<00:05:07.030> maybe<00:05:08.030> 64<00:05:08.720> G<00:05:08.810> okay<00:05:09.200> yes<00:05:09.440> it

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
what it's called maybe 64 G okay yes it

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.970 
what it's called maybe 64 G okay yes it
is<00:05:09.680> indeed<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.250> AR<00:05:10.580> 6200

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
is indeed the AR 6200

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.390 
is indeed the AR 6200
I<00:05:13.010> just<00:05:14.000> put<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.360> remote<00:05:15.290> receiver<00:05:15.470> up<00:05:15.980> here

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
I just put the remote receiver up here

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.700 
I just put the remote receiver up here
or<00:05:17.060> just<00:05:17.240> it's<00:05:17.420> over<00:05:17.690> top<00:05:17.930> which<00:05:18.170> actually

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
or just it's over top which actually

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.320 
or just it's over top which actually
probably<00:05:19.160> no<00:05:19.430> this<00:05:19.580> is<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.700> different<00:05:19.940> pin

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
probably no this is a different pin

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.050 
probably no this is a different pin
because<00:05:20.950> me<00:05:21.950> along<00:05:22.400> with<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.580> lot<00:05:22.790> of<00:05:22.820> other

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
because me along with a lot of other

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.810 
because me along with a lot of other
people<00:05:23.420> were<00:05:23.540> having<00:05:23.840> issues<00:05:24.020> with<00:05:24.820> the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
people were having issues with the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.460 
people were having issues with the
canopy<00:05:26.270> bowling<00:05:26.600> open<00:05:26.900> in<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.110> middle<00:05:27.320> of<00:05:27.380> the

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
canopy bowling open in the middle of the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.160 
canopy bowling open in the middle of the
flight<00:05:27.740> which<00:05:28.010> really<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.460> not<00:05:28.670> good<00:05:29.170> there's

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
flight which really is not good there's

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.080 
flight which really is not good there's
a<00:05:30.260> whole<00:05:30.440> lot<00:05:30.650> of<00:05:30.770> drag<00:05:31.010> that's<00:05:31.220> created<00:05:31.670> so<00:05:31.880> I

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
a whole lot of drag that's created so I

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.990 
a whole lot of drag that's created so I
just<00:05:32.450> have<00:05:32.570> this<00:05:32.750> pin<00:05:33.260> set<00:05:33.560> up<00:05:33.710> here<00:05:34.000> little

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
just have this pin set up here little

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.160 
just have this pin set up here little
wouldn't<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:37.730> notch<00:05:37.940> in<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.870> can<00:05:39.050> do

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
wouldn't the notch in it you can do

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.230 
wouldn't the notch in it you can do
whatever<00:05:39.350> you<00:05:39.620> like<00:05:39.650> for<00:05:40.010> that<00:05:40.130> that's<00:05:41.000> just

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
whatever you like for that that's just

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.020 
whatever you like for that that's just
moving<00:05:41.390> with<00:05:41.720> CA<00:05:41.960> glue<00:05:42.670> that's<00:05:43.670> basically

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
moving with CA glue that's basically

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.070 
moving with CA glue that's basically
what<00:05:44.240> we<00:05:44.330> have<00:05:44.540> underneath<00:05:44.840> here<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.530> can<00:05:46.190> see

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
what we have underneath here you can see

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.310 
what we have underneath here you can see
on<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.440> receiver<00:05:48.880> going<00:05:49.880> into<00:05:50.150> it<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:50.480> don't

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
on the receiver going into it I don't

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.680 
on the receiver going into it I don't
have<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.620> Y<00:05:51.800> harness<00:05:52.220> anymore<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:53.390> that<00:05:53.510> was

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
have the Y harness anymore and that was

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.590 
have the Y harness anymore and that was
to<00:05:53.840> make<00:05:53.930> possible<00:05:54.230> for<00:05:54.470> flapper<00:05:54.830> on<00:05:55.100> mixing

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
to make possible for flapper on mixing

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.700 
to make possible for flapper on mixing
these<00:05:56.600> high<00:05:57.530> tech<00:05:57.860> HS<00:05:58.520> 65<00:05:59.150> servos<00:05:59.660> and<00:05:59.870> the

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
these high tech HS 65 servos and the

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.860 
these high tech HS 65 servos and the
radio<00:06:01.070> which<00:06:01.400> will<00:06:01.700> bring<00:06:02.210> us<00:06:02.360> right<00:06:02.540> -<00:06:02.690> that

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
radio which will bring us right - that

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.910 
radio which will bring us right - that
is<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:04.070> dx6i<00:06:05.140> which<00:06:06.140> is<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.590> great

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
is the dx6i which is a great

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.800 
is the dx6i which is a great
multipurpose<00:06:07.460> radio<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.270> many<00:06:08.540> of<00:06:08.690> you

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
multipurpose radio and many of you

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.770 
multipurpose radio and many of you
probably<00:06:09.140> own<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.470> already<00:06:09.940> so<00:06:10.940> I<00:06:11.240> just<00:06:11.600> have

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
probably own it already so I just have

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.360 
probably own it already so I just have
it<00:06:11.930> set<00:06:12.170> for<00:06:12.200> I<00:06:12.970> can<00:06:13.970> have<00:06:14.120> a<00:06:14.150> look
