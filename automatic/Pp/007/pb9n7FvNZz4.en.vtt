00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.200 

basically<00:00:41.470> it's<00:00:41.860> an<00:00:42.010> Octavia<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.880> introduce

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
basically it's an Octavia to introduce

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.410 
basically it's an Octavia to introduce
us<00:00:43.360> fuzz<00:00:43.630> to<00:00:44.140> your<00:00:44.290> circuit<00:00:44.770> or<00:00:45.340> sound<00:00:45.790> and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
us fuzz to your circuit or sound and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.570 
us fuzz to your circuit or sound and
also<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.930> slight<00:00:47.290> higher<00:00:47.500> octave<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.190> love<00:00:48.460> it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
also a slight higher octave I love it

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.940 
also a slight higher octave I love it
because<00:00:48.820> it's<00:00:49.660> not<00:00:49.900> very<00:00:50.170> black<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.620> whites

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.520 
because it's not very black and whites
are<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.760> cut<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.480> know<00:00:52.570> certain<00:00:52.990> areas<00:00:53.350> it's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
are you cut you know certain areas it's

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.560 
are you cut you know certain areas it's
more<00:00:53.680> prominent<00:00:54.100> than<00:00:54.250> others<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.510> very

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
more prominent than others and it's very

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.840 
more prominent than others and it's very
organic<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.380> have<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.620> work<00:00:56.770> with<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:57.160> and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
organic and you have to work with it and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.670 
organic and you have to work with it and
there<00:00:58.000> could<00:00:58.120> be<00:00:58.150> a<00:00:58.240> lot<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.450> fun<00:00:58.570> level<00:00:59.260> and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
there could be a lot of fun level and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.280 
there could be a lot of fun level and
boost<00:01:00.340> levels<00:01:01.060> pretty<00:01:01.390> simple<00:01:01.900> if<00:01:02.110> you've

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
boost levels pretty simple if you've

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.500 
boost levels pretty simple if you've
owned<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.620> hell<00:01:02.800> ever<00:01:03.070> before<00:01:03.520> you<00:01:04.210> know<00:01:04.330> what

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
owned of hell ever before you know what

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.300 
owned of hell ever before you know what
it's<00:01:04.630> gonna<00:01:04.720> do<00:01:05.020> but<00:01:05.320> basically<00:01:05.710> just<00:01:06.070> check

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
it's gonna do but basically just check

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's gonna do but basically just check
it<00:01:06.430> out<00:01:06.550> there<00:01:06.760> is<00:01:07.120> volume<00:01:07.600> boost<00:01:08.590> what<00:01:08.920> you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
it out there is volume boost what you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.290 
it out there is volume boost what you
tend<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.280> find<00:01:09.430> with<00:01:09.640> this<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.120> lot<00:01:10.240> of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
tend to find with this and a lot of

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.230 
tend to find with this and a lot of
Octavia's<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.140> on<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.770> lower<00:01:11.979> half<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:13.060> will

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
Octavia's is on the lower half you will

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.990 
Octavia's is on the lower half you will
have<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.780> stronger<00:01:14.410> octave<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.040> less<00:01:15.400> fuss<00:01:15.729> and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
have a stronger octave and less fuss and

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.050 
have a stronger octave and less fuss and
on<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.420> other<00:01:16.990> side<00:01:17.410> more<00:01:17.920> furs<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.490> not<00:01:18.880> as

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
on the other side more furs and not as

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.450 
on the other side more furs and not as
strong<00:01:19.450> as<00:01:19.630> an<00:01:19.720> octave<00:01:20.170> depends<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.130> pedal

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
strong as an octave depends on the pedal

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.090 
strong as an octave depends on the pedal

do it anyway we're going to start off

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.710 
do it anyway we're going to start off
with<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.819> controls<00:02:13.240> at<00:02:14.170> new<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.569> we'll<00:02:16.569> go

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
with the controls at new and we'll go

00:02:16.720 --> 00:03:03.309 
with the controls at new and we'll go
from<00:02:16.750> there

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:35.120

next<00:04:13.510> example<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.260> will<00:04:14.530> be<00:04:14.680> playing<00:04:14.920> in<00:04:15.190> a

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
next example I will be playing in a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.539 
next example I will be playing in a
lower<00:04:15.430> register<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.870> other<00:04:17.290> slightly<00:04:18.220> famous

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
lower register and other slightly famous

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.020 
lower register and other slightly famous
r<00:04:18.790> if<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:20.590> kind<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.070> get<00:04:21.220> organized<00:04:21.730> owns

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
r if I can kind of get organized owns

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.360 
r if I can kind of get organized owns
down<00:04:22.360> here<00:04:22.630> but<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.080> know<00:04:23.200> there's<00:04:24.160> room<00:04:24.340> to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
down here but you know there's room to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:42.690 
down here but you know there's room to
be<00:04:24.610> creative<00:04:40.410> for<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.500> last<00:04:41.710> example<00:04:41.890> we<00:04:42.460> are
