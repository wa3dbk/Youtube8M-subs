I<00:00:33.840> haven't<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.620> active<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.820> used<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> be

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
I haven't been as active as I used to be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.110 
I haven't been as active as I used to be
of<00:00:36.899> course<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:38.070> exams<00:00:38.880> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
of course that is because exams are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.390 
of course that is because exams are
coming<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.810> and<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.190> still<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
coming up and right now it's still a

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.430 
coming up and right now it's still a
study<00:00:41.700> period<00:00:42.150> so<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.330> do<00:00:42.480> still<00:00:42.900> have<00:00:42.960> plenty

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
study period so I do still have plenty

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.060 
study period so I do still have plenty
of<00:00:43.650> time<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.210> make<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.240> videos<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.380> to<00:00:46.740> still

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
of time to make some videos and to still

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
of time to make some videos and to still
interact<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.910> not<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.020> much<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.470> used<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
interact a bit not as much as I used to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760 
interact a bit not as much as I used to
but<00:00:50.310> for<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.360> okay<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.500> real

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but for now it's still okay the real

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.260 
but for now it's still okay the real
reason<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.190> went<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.490> make<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.730> video<00:00:53.970> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
reason I went to make this video is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.340 
reason I went to make this video is
because<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.770> week<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> 5th<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:58.200> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
because the week of the 5th is going to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.800 
because the week of the 5th is going to
be<00:00:58.530> suicide<00:00:59.340> week<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.450> is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
be suicide week for me because that is

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.789 
be suicide week for me because that is

all<00:03:11.200> kind<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.010> same<00:03:12.220> thing<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.490> then<00:03:12.580> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
all kind of same thing and then the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.790 
all kind of same thing and then the
fourth<00:03:13.420> exam<00:03:13.780> was<00:03:14.110> um<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:16.170> writing<00:03:17.170> an<00:03:17.650> essay

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800

to<00:03:21.489> whatever<00:03:21.760> so<00:03:21.910> it's<00:03:22.060> essentially<00:03:22.600> using

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
to whatever so it's essentially using

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.199 
to whatever so it's essentially using
the<00:03:23.050> same<00:03:23.290> stuff<00:03:24.010> from<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.340> grammar<00:03:24.610> exam<00:03:25.000> but

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
the same stuff from the grammar exam but

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.030 
the same stuff from the grammar exam but
it's<00:03:25.360> always<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.200> different<00:03:26.650> aspect

it's always like in a different aspect

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.770 
it's always like in a different aspect
so<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:28.830> should<00:03:29.830> be<00:03:29.860> okay<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:30.820> I'm<00:03:31.209> going<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> be

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
so there will be a video every week I

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.240 
so there will be a video every week I
can't<00:06:02.020> guarantee<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.560> going<00:06:02.830> to<00:06:02.919> be<00:06:03.009> the
