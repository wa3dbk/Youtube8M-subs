00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
designer so we kind of both my brother
and<00:01:03.929> I<00:01:03.960> grew<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.700> with<00:01:05.700> design<00:01:06.000> around<00:01:06.210> us<00:01:06.390> all

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and I grew up with design around us all

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.030 
and I grew up with design around us all
the<00:01:06.570> time<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> matter<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the time and it was just a matter of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
the time and it was just a matter of
which<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> design<00:01:09.360> were<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.660> into

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
which kind of design were going into

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.940 
which kind of design were going into
architecture<00:01:10.530> graphic<00:01:10.830> sir<00:01:11.840> apparel<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
architecture graphic sir apparel and for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
architecture graphic sir apparel and for
me<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> end<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.329> day<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
me actually at the end of the day I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
me actually at the end of the day I
figured<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.079> be<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.409> girls<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.950> fashion

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
figured there be more girls in fashion

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
figured there be more girls in fashion
and<00:01:17.549> an<00:01:17.729> architecture<00:01:18.329> or<00:01:18.479> graphic<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and an architecture or graphic so that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.530 
and an architecture or graphic so that
was<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
was that

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:31.539 
was that

[Music]

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.709 
[Music]
yeah<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.969> an<00:01:33.119> example<00:01:35.030> these<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.270> fabric

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
yeah it's an example these are fabric

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.340 
yeah it's an example these are fabric
selections<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.060> sketches<00:01:39.060> loose<00:01:39.689> ideas

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
selections and then sketches loose ideas

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.510 
selections and then sketches loose ideas
for<00:01:40.829> details<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:43.069> this<00:01:44.069> is<00:01:44.219> usually<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
for details and this is usually the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.990 
for details and this is usually the
first<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.539> make<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
first thing we do then we make the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.190 
first thing we do then we make the
muslin<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> Nestle<00:01:48.689> program<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
muslin or the Nestle program the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.149 
muslin or the Nestle program the
prototype<00:01:49.590> after<00:01:50.459> that's<00:01:50.969> done<00:01:52.009> then<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
prototype after that's done then it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
prototype after that's done then it
turns<00:01:53.369> into<00:01:53.520> something<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:56.299> which<00:01:57.299> is

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
turns into something like this which is

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.499 
turns into something like this which is
a<00:01:58.049> technical<00:01:58.920> drawing<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.549> these<00:02:00.209> are<00:02:00.360> done

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a technical drawing and these are done

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.949 
a technical drawing and these are done
we<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.229> these<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.469> Illustrator<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.720> once

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
we do these in Illustrator and then once

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.990 
we do these in Illustrator and then once
this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.289> made<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.159> whole<00:02:05.310> thing<00:02:05.549> gets<00:02:05.759> sent

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this is made the whole thing gets sent

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.399 
this is made the whole thing gets sent
together<00:02:06.239> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> patterns<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
together with the patterns to the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
together with the patterns to the
factory<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.890> Czech<00:02:08.039> Republic<00:02:08.459> where<00:02:08.970> they

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
factory in Czech Republic where they

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
factory in Czech Republic where they
make<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> first<00:02:09.869> prototype<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.530> actual

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
make the first prototype in the actual

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.729 
make the first prototype in the actual
fabric<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.790> comes<00:02:12.030> back<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.420> us<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:13.410> approve

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
fabric that comes back to us we approve

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.509 
fabric that comes back to us we approve
it<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.069> then<00:02:15.829> then<00:02:16.829> he<00:02:16.920> goes<00:02:17.099> into<00:02:17.280> production

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
it and then then he goes into production

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:34.940 
it and then then he goes into production
and<00:02:17.790> that's<00:02:17.970> actually<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.360> final<00:02:18.720> piece<00:02:33.950> head

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and that's actually the final piece head

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
and that's actually the final piece head
over<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> archive<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.109> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
over to the archive so this is the
