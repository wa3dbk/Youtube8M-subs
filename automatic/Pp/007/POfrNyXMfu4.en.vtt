00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.070
 fight for what he wants always and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.439

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.130

 that has always been my support with him 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.069
 because at some point my dream also 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.170
 was singing 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.189

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.079
 who then allows all this to me 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.090
 I identify with him that's why I'm 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.859
 with him here despite everything 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.150

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.830

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.390

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.070
 I would not listen to the bark 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:01.620

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.620

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.840

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.110
 I want to see them then what do you prefer 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.610

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.170
 last week that's wonderful to 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.060
 I do not like this kind of theaters like that 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.100
 we tell you that they are done on stage 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.950
 if you miss your family and you want 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.260
 cry you go to the dressing room not on stage 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.480
 I did pay a ticket, I do not have to 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.700
 see that I came to see the artist and his 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.580
 songs we are then you have to know 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.639
 separate the scenario from the house and pay 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.490
 Thank you 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.979
 announces villarreal 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.690
 I think it's fine because it's very true 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.530
 that you must take care of the energy 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.009
 overflowing is a risk and is a danger 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.810
 you can complicate the whole song 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.180
 you were good it 's okay that sometimes one 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.870
 get excited with a song but with 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.870
 very careful 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.589
 I just think he did not know 

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.969
 express what he felt does not attribute it to him 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.759
 to his family to his brothers but 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:25.589
 finally in each trial this fact has 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.849
 put you know the soul life and this is 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.769
 a program where nothing else is discussed 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.860
 to make you want is also from 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:34.229
 dedication to being a true artist and 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.030
 I believe that he is on a very 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:40.289
 true where an artist should go 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.169
