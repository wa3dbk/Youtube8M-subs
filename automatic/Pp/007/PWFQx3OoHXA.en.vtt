00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
actually have to follow two different

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.620 
actually have to follow two different
steps<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:45.100> first<00:01:45.340> one<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.060> actually<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.479> can

steps the first one and actually you can

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.569 
steps the first one and actually you can
see<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.990> written<00:01:47.320> here<00:01:47.560> step<00:01:47.950> one<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.520> step

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
see is written here step one and step

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.999 
see is written here step one and step
two<00:01:49.500> let<00:01:50.500> me<00:01:50.619> see<00:01:50.829> if<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.009> fix<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.789> up<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.350> here

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
two let me see if we fix it up and here

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.300 
two let me see if we fix it up and here
is<00:01:54.219> key<00:01:54.429> step<00:01:54.700> two<00:01:55.649> suppose<00:01:56.649> you<00:01:56.770> cannot<00:01:57.100> go

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
is key step two suppose you cannot go

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.929 
is key step two suppose you cannot go
wrong

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
wrong

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.870 
wrong
so<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.240> first<00:01:58.479> step<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:59.049> unscrew<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
so the first step you unscrew it and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.419 
so the first step you unscrew it and
there<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.359> fantastic<00:02:01.689> wonder<00:02:02.679> it's<00:02:03.039> very

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
there is this fantastic wonder it's very

the brush transforms to create

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.170 
the brush transforms to create
spectacular<00:02:37.790> 3d<00:02:38.720> volume<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.370> say<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.910> it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
spectacular 3d volume and I say that it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840 
spectacular 3d volume and I say that it
does<00:02:41.390> mixed<00:02:42.320> Webster<00:02:42.680> expectations<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:43.700> is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
does mixed Webster expectations this is

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.630 
does mixed Webster expectations this is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the second one as you can see it's map

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.910 
the second one as you can see it's map
is<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> fatter<00:02:47.440> brush<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:49.280> basically<00:02:49.820> coats

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
is not clumpy I mean I got it on now I

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.240 
is not clumpy I mean I got it on now I

23<00:03:15.320> pounds<00:03:15.680> 50<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.880> one<00:03:17.150> basic<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:18.170> less

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
23 pounds 50 this one basic is a less

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.730 
23 pounds 50 this one basic is a less
than<00:03:18.680> half<00:03:18.890> price<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.420> effect<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.320> based

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
than half price and the effect is based

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.200 
than half price and the effect is based
probably<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.310> one<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.760> effect<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.120> even

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
probably this one the effect is even

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.530 
probably this one the effect is even
better<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.720> must<00:03:24.020> say<00:03:24.610> for<00:03:25.610> some<00:03:25.850> people<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.360> may

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
better I must say for some people it may

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.840 
better I must say for some people it may
not<00:03:26.600> be<00:03:26.960> ideal<00:03:27.800> because<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.490> to<00:03:28.700> go

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
not be ideal because you have to go

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.330 
not be ideal because you have to go
through<00:03:29.060> two<00:03:29.570> steps<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.710> know<00:03:31.070> if<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.310> are

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
through two steps so you know if you are

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.120 
through two steps so you know if you are
in<00:03:31.490> a<00:03:31.520> hurry<00:03:31.790> maybe<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:33.110> may<00:03:33.260> want<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.680> go<00:03:33.890> for

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
in a hurry maybe you may want to go for

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.000 
in a hurry maybe you may want to go for
one<00:03:34.280> step<00:03:34.580> only<00:03:34.820> but<00:03:35.630> in<00:03:35.930> all<00:03:36.080> honesty<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.770> just

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
one step only but in all honesty it just

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.670 
one step only but in all honesty it just
takes<00:03:37.630> probably<00:03:38.630> fifty<00:03:39.020> seconds<00:03:39.440> more<00:03:39.620> to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
takes probably fifty seconds more to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.980 
takes probably fifty seconds more to
apply<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.160> mascara<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.150> as<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.540> said<00:03:41.810> this

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
apply the mascara and as I said this

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.680 
apply the mascara and as I said this
first<00:03:42.380> one<00:03:42.830> now<00:03:43.100> Leslie<00:03:43.910> doesn't<00:03:44.120> apply<00:03:44.540> too

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
first one now Leslie doesn't apply too

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.870 
first one now Leslie doesn't apply too

this one lasts only three months to be

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.420 
this one lasts only three months to be
honest<00:06:14.570> wouldn't<00:06:14.990> work<00:06:15.169> out<00:06:15.410> as<00:06:15.830> a<00:06:15.889> good<00:06:16.160> deal

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
honest wouldn't work out as a good deal

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.300 
honest wouldn't work out as a good deal
because<00:06:16.729> the<00:06:17.570> georgia<00:06:18.169> man<00:06:18.320> is<00:06:18.500> 23<00:06:18.979> pounds

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
because the georgia man is 23 pounds

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.730 
because the georgia man is 23 pounds
fifty<00:06:19.760> so<00:06:20.419> let's<00:06:20.600> get<00:06:20.780> more<00:06:20.930> or<00:06:21.110> less<00:06:21.139> about

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
fifty so let's get more or less about

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.620 
fifty so let's get more or less about
half<00:06:21.950> two<00:06:22.070> bodies<00:06:22.370> every<00:06:22.639> three<00:06:22.880> months<00:06:23.060> you

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
half two bodies every three months you

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.010 
half two bodies every three months you
know<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.229> cost<00:06:24.500> is<00:06:24.800> very<00:06:25.039> very<00:06:25.370> similar<00:06:26.020> but

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
know the cost is very very similar but

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.100 
know the cost is very very similar but
if<00:06:27.380> it<00:06:27.530> for<00:06:27.800> example<00:06:28.070> these<00:06:28.490> last<00:06:28.940> six<00:06:29.720> months

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
if it for example these last six months

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.350 
if it for example these last six months
or<00:06:30.169> so<00:06:30.289> five<00:06:30.680> months<00:06:30.979> definitely<00:06:31.940> this<00:06:32.120> would

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
or so five months definitely this would

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.020 
or so five months definitely this would
be<00:06:32.539> a<00:06:32.570> much<00:06:32.810> better<00:06:33.050> deal<00:06:33.409> also<00:06:34.159> because<00:06:34.729> as<00:06:35.000> i

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
be a much better deal also because as i

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.430
