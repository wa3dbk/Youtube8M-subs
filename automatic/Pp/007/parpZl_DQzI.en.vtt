00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
we had a hands-on time with a couple of

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.670 
we had a hands-on time with a couple of
the<00:01:09.390> characters<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> salvador<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> gunzerker

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the characters a salvador the gunzerker

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000 
the characters a salvador the gunzerker
and<00:01:11.430> Maya<00:01:11.820> who<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> siren<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> kind

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and Maya who is the siren you and I kind

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.260 
and Maya who is the siren you and I kind
of<00:01:14.040> played<00:01:14.160> both<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.700> switched<00:01:15.060> off

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of played both and then switched off

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.180 
of played both and then switched off
halfway<00:01:15.570> through<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.590> played<00:01:16.860> characters

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
halfway through we played characters

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.220 
halfway through we played characters
that<00:01:17.460> were<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.940> level<00:01:18.240> 20<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> we

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
that were around level 20 I think so we

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.380 
that were around level 20 I think so we
were<00:01:19.380> able<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.650> invest<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.070> some<00:01:20.220> skills<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
were able to invest in some skills as a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.180 
were able to invest in some skills as a
Gunzerker<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> put<00:01:22.350> pretty<00:01:22.530> much<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.070> my

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
Gunzerker I put pretty much all of my

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.460 
Gunzerker I put pretty much all of my
abilities<00:01:23.580> into<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> dual<00:01:24.330> wielding<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
abilities into the dual wielding and so

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.720 
abilities into the dual wielding and so
basically<00:01:25.620> that<00:01:25.860> meant<00:01:26.190> like<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
basically that meant like you know you

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.820 
basically that meant like you know you
can<00:01:26.910> only<00:01:26.970> trigger<00:01:27.300> this<00:01:27.540> ability<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.530> often

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
can only trigger this ability so often

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.550 
can only trigger this ability so often
just<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.280> first<00:01:29.460> game<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.600> by

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
just like in the first game but by

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.860 
just like in the first game but by
putting<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.310> 20-plus<00:01:32.910> points<00:01:33.090> i<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> able

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
putting you my 20-plus points i was able

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.050 
putting you my 20-plus points i was able
to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.440> will<00:01:34.650> watch<00:01:35.100> whenever<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.520> wanted<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to do will watch whenever I wanted I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.280 
to do will watch whenever I wanted I
think<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:36.420> there's<00:01:36.600> something<00:01:36.780> Billy<00:01:36.990> where

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
think that there's something Billy where

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.570 
think that there's something Billy where
like<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.620> I<00:01:37.680> killed<00:01:37.920> someone<00:01:38.130> who<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.400> last

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
like if I killed someone who would last

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.030 
like if I killed someone who would last
a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.790> bit<00:01:38.910> longer<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.710> similar

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
a little bit longer and I think similar

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
a little bit longer and I think similar
for<00:01:41.220> phase<00:01:41.400> long<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.940> write<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> can

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
for phase long to write and you can

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that you kind of your character sort of

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.300 
that you kind of your character sort of
throws<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.390> after<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.019> shoot<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
throws it after you shoot it but then it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.690 
throws it after you shoot it but then it
ends<00:02:11.549> up<00:02:11.639> back<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.180> his<00:02:12.359> Han

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
ends up back in his Han

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.240 
ends up back in his Han
it's<00:02:12.879> so<00:02:13.060> weird<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.750> regenerates<00:02:14.530> whatever<00:02:15.099> I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
it's so weird it regenerates whatever I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.490 
it's so weird it regenerates whatever I
person<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.300> does<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:16.629> extra<00:02:17.019> damage<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
person it does like extra damage and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800 
person it does like extra damage and
then<00:02:17.590> it'll<00:02:17.709> explode<00:02:18.190> or<00:02:18.400> something<00:02:18.610> yeah<00:02:19.120> and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
then it'll explode or something yeah and

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.089 
then it'll explode or something yeah and
I<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.530> talked<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> couple<00:02:20.980> of

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
I think we talked to a couple of

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.100 
I think we talked to a couple of
developers<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.879> everyone's<00:02:22.330> favorite<00:02:22.780> type

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
developers and everyone's favorite type

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.990 
developers and everyone's favorite type
of<00:02:23.140> weapon<00:02:23.530> was<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.709> TDR<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.370> yeah<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.970> can

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
of weapon was the TDR but yeah you can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.479 
of weapon was the TDR but yeah you can
kind<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.540> basically<00:02:26.170> when<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.769> throw<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.250> you

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
kind of basically when you throw it you

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.830 
kind of basically when you throw it you
obviously--you<00:02:27.940> throat<00:02:28.269> when<00:02:28.420> you're<00:02:28.569> empty

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
obviously--you throat when you're empty

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.330 
obviously--you throat when you're empty
instead<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.230> reloading<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.190> does<00:02:30.310> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
instead of reloading and it does a

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
instead of reloading and it does a
little<00:02:30.550> bit<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.880> damage<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.780> also<00:02:31.930> when

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200

little bit of damage you can also when
you<00:02:32.260> hit<00:02:32.410> reload<00:02:32.709> throw<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.459> has<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
you hit reload throw it and it has a

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.550 
you hit reload throw it and it has a
full<00:02:33.819> clip<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.330> will<00:02:34.450> do<00:02:34.599> more<00:02:34.870> damage<00:02:35.170> so

things that you can do there yeah I i

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420 
things that you can do there yeah I i
will<00:02:40.000> say<00:02:40.299> like<00:02:40.630> out<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.200> all<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.709> actual

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
will say like out of all the actual

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
will say like out of all the actual
shooting<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:44.290> felt<00:02:44.980> kind<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.640> different<00:02:46.120> than

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
shooting it felt kind of different than

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.809 
shooting it felt kind of different than
the<00:02:46.630> first<00:02:46.900> game<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:48.010> necessarily<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
the first game and not necessarily in a

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.059 
the first game and not necessarily in a
good<00:02:48.849> way<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.269> bad<00:02:49.330> way<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.980> different<00:02:50.980> it

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
good way or a bad way just different it

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.550 
good way or a bad way just different it
felt<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.579> my<00:02:51.610> guns<00:02:52.060> were<00:02:52.299> doing<00:02:52.690> less<00:02:52.930> damage

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
felt like my guns were doing less damage

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.770 
felt like my guns were doing less damage
like<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.950> took<00:02:54.190> more<00:02:54.640> rounds<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.329> be<00:02:55.540> able<00:02:55.599> to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
like it took more rounds to be able to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.509 
like it took more rounds to be able to
inflict<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.319> same<00:02:56.470> amount<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.829> damage<00:02:57.190> right

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
inflict the same amount of damage right

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.190 
inflict the same amount of damage right
and<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.120> think<00:02:58.180> part<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.690> might<00:02:59.049> have<00:02:59.170> been

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
and I think part of that might have been

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.809 
and I think part of that might have been
because<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.769> were<00:02:59.920> playing<00:03:00.190> co-op<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.730> they

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
because we were playing co-op and they

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.640 
because we were playing co-op and they
obviously<00:03:00.970> scale<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.780> difficulty<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.260> ran

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
obviously scale the difficulty of ran

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.160 
obviously scale the difficulty of ran
amis<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.310> accommodate<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.060> yeah<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.720> we

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
amis to accommodate that yeah and we

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.319 
amis to accommodate that yeah and we
were<00:03:05.200> really<00:03:05.560> working<00:03:06.250> as<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.610> team<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:07.180> we

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
were really working as a team like we

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.640 
were really working as a team like we
should<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.569> been<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.930> know<00:03:08.049> like<00:03:08.230> refunded

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
should have been you know like refunded

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.199 
should have been you know like refunded

almost<00:03:46.720> yeah<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.170> weird<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.920> then<00:03:48.280> I

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
almost yeah really weird and then I

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.740 
almost yeah really weird and then I
think<00:03:48.639> my<00:03:48.790> favorite<00:03:49.000> one<00:03:49.269> was<00:03:49.299> actually<00:03:49.690> only

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
think my favorite one was actually only

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.690 
think my favorite one was actually only
caustic<00:03:50.170> caverns<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.769> there<00:03:51.489> were<00:03:51.639> these

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
caustic caverns and there were these

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.670 
caustic caverns and there were these
crystal<00:03:52.480> guys<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.900> forget<00:03:53.139> their<00:03:53.230> exact<00:03:53.500> name

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
crystal guys I forget their exact name

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.280 
crystal guys I forget their exact name
where<00:03:54.130> they're<00:03:54.250> basically<00:03:54.609> these<00:03:54.850> huge

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
where they're basically these huge

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.420 
where they're basically these huge
things<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.440> have<00:03:56.560> these<00:03:56.680> crystals<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.310> their

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
things that have these crystals on their

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.370 
things that have these crystals on their
feet<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:58.329> was<00:03:58.480> their<00:03:58.599> vulnerable<00:03:59.079> point

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
feet and that was their vulnerable point

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.839 
feet and that was their vulnerable point
so<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.680> had<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.280> shoot<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.579> different

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
so you had to shoot the different

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.879 
so you had to shoot the different
crystals<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.780> break<00:04:01.959> them<00:04:02.139> down<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.650> do<00:04:02.739> new

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
crystals to break them down and do new

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.620 
crystals to break them down and do new
damage<00:04:03.099> otherwise<00:04:03.579> they<00:04:03.819> were<00:04:03.940> like<00:04:04.090> very

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
damage otherwise they were like very

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.809 
damage otherwise they were like very
heavily<00:04:05.019> armored<00:04:05.440> unit

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
heavily armored unit

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.550 
heavily armored unit
and<00:04:05.909> almost<00:04:06.060> impossible<00:04:06.599> take<00:04:06.749> him<00:04:06.900> down<00:04:07.049> and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
and almost impossible take him down and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.280 
and almost impossible take him down and
I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:07.859> my<00:04:08.219> overall<00:04:08.969> favorite<00:04:09.180> was<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.780> boss

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
I think my overall favorite was the boss

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.440 
I think my overall favorite was the boss
version<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:11.010> yea<00:04:11.280> which<00:04:11.760> was<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:12.090> caustic

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
version of that yea which was on caustic

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.550 
version of that yea which was on caustic
caverns<00:04:12.689> I<00:04:12.780> don't<00:04:12.900> think<00:04:13.049> we<00:04:13.109> have<00:04:13.200> footage<00:04:13.349> of

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
caverns I don't think we have footage of

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.800 
caverns I don't think we have footage of
this<00:04:13.709> but<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.579> was<00:04:14.700> basically<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:15.120> giant<00:04:15.420> blue

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
this but it was basically a giant blue

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.719 
this but it was basically a giant blue
version<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.410> crystal<00:04:16.769> guy<00:04:16.889> there<00:04:17.609> was

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
version of the crystal guy there was

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.140 
version of the crystal guy there was
okay<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.870> he<00:04:19.039> had<00:04:20.039> some<00:04:20.400> sort<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.639> item<00:04:20.970> that

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
okay and he had some sort of item that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.730 
okay and he had some sort of item that
you<00:04:21.269> had<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.570> retrieve<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.229> class<00:04:22.500> and

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
you had to retrieve for this class and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.270 
you had to retrieve for this class and
so<00:04:23.130> basically<00:04:23.280> once<00:04:23.669> he<00:04:23.820> shot<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.630> guy<00:04:24.930> down<00:04:25.280> a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so basically once he shot the guy down a

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.700 
so basically once he shot the guy down a
chest<00:04:27.060> would<00:04:27.300> open<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.080> out<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:28.380> his<00:04:28.500> mouth

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
chest would open like out of his mouth

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.800 
chest would open like out of his mouth
and<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.460> had<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.699> go<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.060> there<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.509> retrieve

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810

and you had to go in there to retrieve
the<00:04:31.050> item<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:32.280> ended<00:04:32.520> up<00:04:32.610> being<00:04:32.789> nude

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150

because it's like right in the middle of
caustic<00:04:45.210> caverns<00:04:45.539> and<00:04:45.750> there's<00:04:45.960> all<00:04:46.110> these

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
caustic caverns and there's all these

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.469 
caustic caverns and there's all these
like<00:04:46.380> radioactive<00:04:46.740> pools<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.430> acid<00:04:47.789> around<00:04:47.880> so

like radioactive pools of acid around so

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.510 
like radioactive pools of acid around so
you<00:04:48.570> have<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.810> kind<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.080> avoid<00:04:49.710> them<00:04:50.039> while

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
you have to kind of avoid them while

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.189 
you have to kind of avoid them while
you're<00:04:50.729> avoiding<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.300> giant<00:04:51.930> like

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199

borderlands i think is a type of game

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.909 
borderlands i think is a type of game
where<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.229> want<00:05:43.409> to<00:05:43.470> spend<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.680> lot<00:05:43.770> of<00:05:43.830> time
