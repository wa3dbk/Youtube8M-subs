Geeks and today we'll be taking a look
at<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.809> vandy<00:00:12.260> flashing<00:00:12.980> LED<00:00:13.520> TPU<00:00:14.119> case<00:00:14.389> for

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
at the vandy flashing LED TPU case for

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.180 
at the vandy flashing LED TPU case for
the<00:00:15.049> Samsung<00:00:15.469> Galaxy<00:00:15.500> s4<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:17.199> is<00:00:18.199> a<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.770> very

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 this is a a very

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.220 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 this is a a very
unique<00:00:19.790> case<00:00:20.120> because<00:00:20.630> it<00:00:20.660> takes<00:00:21.050> advantage

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
unique case because it takes advantage

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.490 
unique case because it takes advantage
of<00:00:21.770> a<00:00:22.490> feature<00:00:23.180> that<00:00:23.600> is<00:00:23.930> not<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:24.260> well<00:00:24.470> known

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
of a feature that is not so well known

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.460 
of a feature that is not so well known
in<00:00:25.040> these<00:00:25.370> galaxy<00:00:25.820> phones<00:00:26.030> and<00:00:26.470> features

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
in these galaxy phones and features

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.750 
in these galaxy phones and features
called<00:00:27.680> flash<00:00:28.190> notifications<00:00:29.500> now<00:00:30.640> you<00:00:31.640> can

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
called flash notifications now you can

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.880 
called flash notifications now you can
access<00:00:32.480> flash<00:00:32.960> notifications<00:00:33.559> in<00:00:33.770> the

accessibility menu and when you do it

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.279 
accessibility menu and when you do it
turns<00:00:37.579> a<00:00:37.699> flash<00:00:37.969> on<00:00:38.210> every<00:00:38.570> time<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.079> get<00:00:39.230> a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
notification like a text or a call but

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.950 
notification like a text or a call but
this<00:00:42.199> case<00:00:42.499> uses<00:00:43.010> that<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.460> kind<00:00:44.359> of<00:00:44.510> channels

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
this case uses that and kind of channels

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.259 
this case uses that and kind of channels
that<00:00:45.109> light<00:00:45.350> around<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.159> edges<00:00:46.609> or<00:00:46.850> in

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
that light around to the edges or in

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.819 
that light around to the edges or in
this<00:00:47.390> case<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.839> whole<00:00:47.989> case<00:00:48.199> and<00:00:48.499> the<00:00:48.649> case

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
this case the whole case and the case

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.590 
this case the whole case and the case
lights<00:00:49.219> up<00:00:49.550> as<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:50.149> get<00:00:50.329> texts<00:00:51.339> and<00:00:52.600> really

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
lights up as you get texts and really

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.069 
lights up as you get texts and really
the<00:00:53.749> best<00:00:53.960> way<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.559> think<00:00:54.679> to<00:00:55.960> demonstrate<00:00:56.960> this

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
the best way I think to demonstrate this

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:23.530 
the best way I think to demonstrate this
is<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.379> show<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:57.979> here<00:00:58.670> we<00:00:58.760> go

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.210 

now<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.990> feature<00:01:25.470> doesn't<00:01:26.010> actually

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
now this feature doesn't actually

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.960 
now this feature doesn't actually
require<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:27.620> external<00:01:28.620> battery<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.400> any

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
require a external battery or any

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.340 
require a external battery or any
additional<00:01:30.540> battery<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:30.930> anything<00:01:31.200> else

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
additional battery or anything else

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.250 
additional battery or anything else
because<00:01:32.160> it<00:01:32.910> just<00:01:33.150> uses<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.630> onboard<00:01:34.110> battery

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
because it just uses the onboard battery

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.410 
because it just uses the onboard battery
and<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.830> onboard<00:01:35.460> flash<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> already

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and the onboard flash which is already

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.910 
and the onboard flash which is already
built<00:01:36.660> into<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.050> phone<00:01:37.260> in<00:01:37.560> order<00:01:37.800> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
built into the phone in order to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.420 
built into the phone in order to
activate<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.730> case<00:01:39.360> lighting<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:40.370> as<00:01:41.370> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
activate the case lighting up as a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.670 
activate the case lighting up as a
result<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.210> does<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.690> some<00:01:43.020> battery<00:01:43.410> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
result it does take some battery but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.220 
result it does take some battery but
according<00:01:43.980> to<00:01:44.160> vandy<00:01:44.580> this<00:01:44.790> only<00:01:45.030> takes<00:01:45.330> less

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
according to vandy this only takes less

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.890 
according to vandy this only takes less
than<00:01:46.410> 1%<00:01:46.980> of<00:01:47.100> battery<00:01:47.760> life<00:01:47.940> /<00:01:48.420> full<00:01:48.720> day<00:01:48.870> of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
than 1% of battery life / full day of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.790 
than 1% of battery life / full day of
use<00:01:49.260> which<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.250> pretty<00:01:50.400> excellent<00:01:51.350> now<00:01:52.350> just

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
use which is pretty excellent now just

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.770 
use which is pretty excellent now just
to<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.040> over<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> case<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.730> quick<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.480> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to go over the case really quick it is a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.670 
to go over the case really quick it is a
one-piece<00:01:55.260> TPU<00:01:56.070> case<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:57.330> TPU<00:01:57.990> being<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.410> sort

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
one-piece TPU case so TPU being a sort

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.200 
one-piece TPU case so TPU being a sort
of<00:01:58.770> hard<00:01:59.070> rubber<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.610> soft<00:02:00.330> plastic<00:02:00.870> it's<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
of hard rubber or soft plastic it's a

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
of hard rubber or soft plastic it's a
durable<00:02:03.210> material<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.080> has<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> nice<00:02:04.590> flex

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
durable material but it has a nice flex

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.570 
durable material but it has a nice flex
to<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.490> fits<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.970> there<00:02:06.120> quite<00:02:06.450> easily

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
to it so it fits in there quite easily

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
to it so it fits in there quite easily
as<00:02:08.580> you'll<00:02:08.790> see<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> cutouts<00:02:09.570> are<00:02:09.780> very

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
as you'll see the cutouts are very

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.300 
as you'll see the cutouts are very
accurate<00:02:12.380> everything<00:02:13.380> pretty<00:02:13.710> much<00:02:13.770> fits

just<00:02:14.970> about<00:02:15.150> perfectly<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.950> case<00:02:17.190> even<00:02:17.430> fits

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
just about perfectly the case even fits

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.840 
just about perfectly the case even fits
