00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.080
 when elastic enough 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.299
 that we pass a message we then ask 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040

 but before the step of smoothing plates 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.049

 products containing collagen from 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 keratin and amino acids 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.550

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.660
 in depth and ricoh will apply it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.769

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.769
 minutes before rinsing 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.410
 finally after drying the hair without 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.150
 brushing or the ceramic plates 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.209
 hair appears perfectly smooth 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.250
 souks and brilliant six to eight months after 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.310

 I'm really happy with the result 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.110
 hard to recognize my hair because 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.230
 that it really changes to cockroaches that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.620
 I get used to it but that's exactly what 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.350
 I had dreamed of smooth hair 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.180
 very silky and his fine or in addition to 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.880
 visual level they are they are 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.370

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.200
 so I'm really happy 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.040
 so it's been three weeks now 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.870
 that I did my Japanese smoothing and 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.380
 as you can see I have the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.950
 hair still as stiff and smooth 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.510
 so here I have alas I take the rain 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.910
 no stress because there is no 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.190
 frizz that comes back I do not need to 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.220
 smooth them out no need to make 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.850
 brouchy so it's super convenient to 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.090
 daily 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.580
 and then I could even make a little 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.720
 fringe things that I could never have 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.550
 to do with curly hair 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.550
