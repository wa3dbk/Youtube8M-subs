anyways<00:00:26.779> what<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.019> plant<00:00:28.710> does<00:00:29.010> what's<00:00:29.310> cool

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
anyways what this plant does what's cool

anyways what this plant does what's cool
about<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.880> plan<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:31.850> it<00:00:32.850> even<00:00:33.809> when<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
about this plan is it even when you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.600 
about this plan is it even when you
don't<00:00:34.200> water<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.680> even<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.190> gone<00:00:35.460> without

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
don't water it even if it's gone without

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110 
don't water it even if it's gone without
water<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.440> years<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.680> end<00:00:37.980> supposably<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:39.030> go

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
water for years on end supposably can go

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.200 
water for years on end supposably can go
for<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.719> good<00:00:40.410> 50<00:00:40.920> 60<00:00:41.370> years<00:00:41.610> without<00:00:41.879> water

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
for a good 50 60 years without water

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
for a good 50 60 years without water
it'll<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.320> dry<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.920> curl<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.430> bowl

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it'll just dry up and curl into a bowl

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.470 
it'll just dry up and curl into a bowl
these<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.870> native<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:47.149> desert<00:00:48.149> areas

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
these things are native to desert areas

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.930 
these things are native to desert areas
I'm<00:00:48.719> reading<00:00:49.020> Texas<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.789> very

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I'm reading Texas but it's not very

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
I'm reading Texas but it's not very
reliable<00:00:51.510> source<00:00:51.750> can't<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.559> find<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
reliable source can't really find a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.880 
reliable source can't really find a
whole<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.070> information<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.890> it'll

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
whole lot information on this but it'll

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.040 
whole lot information on this but it'll
shrivel<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> you'll<00:00:57.059> retain<00:00:57.239> 3%<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> its

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
shrivel up and you'll retain 3% of its

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.310 
shrivel up and you'll retain 3% of its
water<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.820> dehydrate<00:01:00.000> itself<00:01:00.690> or

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
water so it will dehydrate itself or

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
water so it will dehydrate itself or
rather<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.160> Sun<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.520> dehydrate<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
rather the Sun will dehydrate it and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
rather the Sun will dehydrate it and
I'll<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.570> curl<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.619> idea<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> when

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I'll just curl up and the idea is when

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.990 
I'll just curl up and the idea is when
it's<00:01:05.820> dry<00:01:06.439> it'll<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.650> roll<00:01:08.400> away<00:01:08.520> roll

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it's dry it'll just roll away roll

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.380 
it's dry it'll just roll away roll
around<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.750> wind<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.409> blow<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:10.920> into

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
around the wind will blow it around into

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.460 
around the wind will blow it around into
another<00:01:12.390> water<00:01:12.659> source<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:14.869> here's<00:01:15.869> mine<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
another water source so here's mine and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
another water source so here's mine and
I've<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.220> completely<00:01:17.580> forgotten<00:01:17.939> about

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I've actually completely forgotten about

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
I've actually completely forgotten about
it<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:19.020> been<00:01:19.290> without<00:01:19.560> water<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:19.950> probably

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it it's been without water for probably

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.109 
it it's been without water for probably
four<00:01:21.299> months<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.670> here<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.909> some

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
four months now and here I have some

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.999 
four months now and here I have some
water<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:26.090> we're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.680> eat<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
water and we're going to eat it and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.190 
water and we're going to eat it and
we're<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> watch<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.990> its<00:01:31.140> thing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we're going to watch it do its thing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
we're going to watch it do its thing
it's<00:01:31.920> gonna<00:01:32.040> spread<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.720> turn<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> little

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it's gonna spread out turn a little

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.390 
it's gonna spread out turn a little
green<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> usually<00:01:34.799> takes<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.159> while

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
green it usually takes a little while

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
green it usually takes a little while
kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> depends<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.619> don't<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.860> it's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
kind of depends I don't know if it's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.039 
kind of depends I don't know if it's
type<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> water<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> temperature<00:01:39.720> or

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
type of water or at the temperature or

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.480 
type of water or at the temperature or
whatnot<00:01:40.200> sometimes<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> tends<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
whatnot sometimes it tends to be kind of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.030 
whatnot sometimes it tends to be kind of
fast<00:01:41.729> sometimes<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.659> slow<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.829> it's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
fast sometimes it's really slow if it's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440 
fast sometimes it's really slow if it's
slow<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.520> I'll<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.820> speed<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> video

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
slow then I'll just speed up the video

00:01:45.450 --> 00:02:06.340 
slow then I'll just speed up the video
for<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.780> guys<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.329> go

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.860 

you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:03:47.770 

you

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.670 

so<00:03:48.780> there<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.049> have<00:03:49.170> it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
so there you have it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.190 
so there you have it
that<00:03:50.340> will<00:03:50.549> open<00:03:50.700> up<00:03:50.909> a<00:03:51.060> little<00:03:51.239> bit<00:03:51.360> more<00:03:51.659> to

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
that will open up a little bit more to

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.380 
that will open up a little bit more to
give<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> couple<00:03:52.829> more<00:03:53.040> hours<00:03:53.390> this

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
give it a couple more hours this

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.059 
give it a couple more hours this
actually<00:03:54.900> only<00:03:55.049> took<00:03:55.230> about<00:03:55.290> seven<00:03:55.920> minutes

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
actually only took about seven minutes

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.509 
actually only took about seven minutes
well<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.780> can<00:03:57.930> see<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.819> better<00:03:59.819> at<00:04:00.000> an<00:04:00.090> angle

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
well you can see it better at an angle

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.069 
well you can see it better at an angle
now<00:04:02.519> what<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.760> strides<00:04:03.090> pretty<00:04:03.510> fradulent

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
now what it strides pretty fradulent

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.339 
now what it strides pretty fradulent
pretty<00:04:05.040> easy<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.430> break<00:04:05.579> but<00:04:06.049> after<00:04:07.049> it's<00:04:07.200> got

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
pretty easy to break but after it's got
