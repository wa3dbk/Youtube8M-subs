just let everything kind of simmer and
the<00:05:45.120> gravy<00:05:45.540> will<00:05:45.840> thicken<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.320> bit<00:05:46.760> so<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.000> heat

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
the gravy will thicken a bit so the heat

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.000 
the gravy will thicken a bit so the heat
doesn't<00:05:48.660> have<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.930> be<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:49.230> high<00:05:49.410> we'll<00:05:49.710> flip

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
doesn't have to be so high we'll flip

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.790
