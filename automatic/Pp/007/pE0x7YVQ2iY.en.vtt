adding<00:01:36.930> new<00:01:37.140> features<00:01:37.409> such<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.159> camera<00:01:38.759> was

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
adding new features such as a camera was

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.789 
adding new features such as a camera was
seen<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> way<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.960> drive<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> price<00:01:40.770> down

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
seen as a way to drive the price down

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399 
seen as a way to drive the price down
even<00:01:41.369> further<00:01:41.579> which<00:01:42.000> i<00:01:42.119> agree<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
even further which i agree with and I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
even further which i agree with and I
guess<00:01:43.470> Apple<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.490> wants<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> focus

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
guess Apple for now just wants to focus

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.319 
guess Apple for now just wants to focus

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
PSP only is about 600 so I mean as a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
handheld device not an ipod ipod touch

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.310 
handheld device not an ipod ipod touch
is<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.270> really<00:02:15.510> competing<00:02:16.050> with<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
is like it's really competing with the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.980 
is like it's really competing with the
DS<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.070> PSP<00:02:17.220> arm<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:21.030> makes<00:02:21.360> somewhat

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
DS and PSP arm so it makes somewhat

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.990 
DS and PSP arm so it makes somewhat
sense<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.590> why<00:02:22.770> Apple<00:02:23.310> added<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.670> video

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
sense as to why Apple added a video

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.290 
sense as to why Apple added a video
