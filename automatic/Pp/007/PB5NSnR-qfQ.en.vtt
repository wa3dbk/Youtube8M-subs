00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
each other and this works brilliantly

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
others of the same species because a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
others of the same species because a
smell<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.039> last<00:01:02.219> over<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> can

leave a communicative smell in one place
and<00:01:06.299> another<00:01:06.510> cat<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> come<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.290> another<00:01:07.380> time

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and another cat can come at another time

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
and another cat can come at another time
and<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> communication<00:01:09.299> without

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and and get that communication without

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
and and get that communication without
you<00:01:09.930> ever<00:01:10.110> having<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.470> come<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.799> inter
