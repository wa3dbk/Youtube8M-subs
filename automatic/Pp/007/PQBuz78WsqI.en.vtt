00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
yup the two gas so he's going to be

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.210 
yup the two gas so he's going to be
going<00:00:03.449> for<00:00:03.689> one<00:00:04.200> battery<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:04.980> he'll<00:00:05.100> probably

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
going for one battery and he'll probably

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.789 
going for one battery and he'll probably
add<00:00:05.520> another<00:00:05.549> faculty<00:00:05.970> soon<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.529> one

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
add another faculty soon and that one

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.259 
add another faculty soon and that one
command<00:00:08.069> center<00:00:08.280> he<00:00:08.429> wants<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.790> CompStat

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
command center he wants that CompStat

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.240 
command center he wants that CompStat
station<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.750> right<00:00:10.050> away<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.920> he's<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.190> to

go<00:00:11.580> ahead<00:00:11.700> he'll<00:00:12.030> probably<00:00:12.210> scan<00:00:12.570> over<00:00:13.500> here

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
go ahead he'll probably scan over here

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950 
go ahead he'll probably scan over here
in<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.130> area<00:00:14.240> to<00:00:15.240> kind<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> look<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.809> here

in this area to kind of look for here
his<00:00:16.080> tech<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:16.529> he<00:00:17.070> might<00:00:17.220> scan<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:17.850> here<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
his tech or he might scan right here to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.939

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
floated in right here and then hard he

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.690 
floated in right here and then hard he

made a fire bat or something oh and a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
made a fire bat or something oh and a
lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.939> dragoons<00:01:09.570> produced<00:01:10.020> by<00:01:10.229> key<00:01:10.470> right

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
lot of dragoons produced by key right

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
lot of dragoons produced by key right
here<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.130> he<00:01:11.760> maybe<00:01:12.270> he's<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> little

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
here so he maybe he's going for a little

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.420 
here so he maybe he's going for a little
bit<00:01:13.200> later<00:01:13.409> Templars<00:01:13.890> yeah<00:01:14.100> he<00:01:14.159> doesn't<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
bit later Templars yeah he doesn't that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.320 
bit later Templars yeah he doesn't that
he<00:01:14.490> does<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.790> throw<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> temple

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
he does not throw in that temple

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.030 
he does not throw in that temple
archives<00:01:15.750> down<00:01:16.020> let<00:01:16.259> away<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.680> expected

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
archives down let away like I expected

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
archives down let away like I expected
him<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.939> yeah

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
him to but yeah

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.910 
him to but yeah
reason<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> you'll<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.439> products<00:01:19.680> players

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
reason that you'll see products players

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.319 
reason that you'll see products players
kind<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> spread<00:01:20.490> cannons<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:20.970> around<00:01:21.149> their

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
kind of spread cannons out around their

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.399 
kind of spread cannons out around their
main<00:01:21.479> even<00:01:21.960> though<00:01:22.049> they're<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
main even though they're not going to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
main even though they're not going to
get<00:01:22.500> attack<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.399> they<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
get attack is because they don't want to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
get attack is because they don't want to
