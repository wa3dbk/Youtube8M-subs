00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it won't be smooth motion just like an

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719 
it won't be smooth motion just like an
arrow<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.290> no<00:01:34.950> freeze<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> then

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
freeway that's packed put it out closer

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.650 
freeway that's packed put it out closer
it's<00:02:30.620> let<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> load<00:02:31.190> um<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:32.000> does<00:02:32.180> take<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> lots

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
it's let it load um it does take a lots

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.320 
it's let it load um it does take a lots
of<00:02:32.810> out<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.110> times

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330

mm<00:02:35.330> nope<00:02:35.570> think<00:02:35.840> that's<00:02:35.990> big<00:02:36.170> enough<00:02:37.840> okay

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
mm nope think that's big enough okay

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.330 
mm nope think that's big enough okay
that's<00:02:39.230> weights<00:02:39.560> um

not really really where I am well it's

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.000 
not really really where I am well it's
because<00:03:01.670> it's<00:03:01.820> locating<00:03:02.390> their<00:03:02.630> router<00:03:03.530> not

so<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.570> chanting<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.410> 3g<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.830> better<00:03:10.070> as<00:03:10.940> you

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
so a chanting the 3g is better as you

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.560 
so a chanting the 3g is better as you
can<00:03:11.270> see<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:12.950> can't<00:03:13.280> really<00:03:13.430> see<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.820> can

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.590 

right<00:03:17.570> there<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.080> means<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.470> Pat<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:20.299> tells

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
right there that means that Pat it tells

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.400 
right there that means that Pat it tells
you<00:03:20.870> if<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.680> if<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:23.120> writing<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:24.110> bad

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you if it's if the writing is good bad

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.880 
you if it's if the writing is good bad
or<00:03:24.440> medium<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.640> could<00:03:25.820> see<00:03:25.970> right<00:03:26.090> there

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
or medium so you could see right there

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.620 
or medium so you could see right there
I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.940> camera<00:03:29.269> will<00:03:29.420> adjust<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:30.070> but

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
I think the camera will adjust it but

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.050 
I think the camera will adjust it but
what<00:03:32.630> else<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.799> ask<00:03:34.220> search<00:03:34.850> by

information<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.269> know<00:03:47.390> just<00:03:47.720> tells<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.110> that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
information you know just tells you that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.160 
information you know just tells you that
unit<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.060> distance<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.630> can<00:03:50.840> put<00:03:51.049> in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
unit of distance you can put in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.449 
unit of distance you can put in
kilometers<00:03:51.769> or<00:03:51.980> miles<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:54.200> well<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:54.860> it

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
kilometers or miles so well so it

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.890 
kilometers or miles so well so it
doesn't<00:03:55.850> what<00:03:56.030> didn't<00:03:56.239> Inc<00:03:56.390> is<00:03:56.510> not<00:03:56.690> to

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
doesn't what didn't Inc is not to

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.750 
doesn't what didn't Inc is not to
refresh<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.440> would<00:03:57.590> say<00:03:57.739> if<00:03:58.400> you're<00:03:58.549> using

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
refresh I would say if you're using

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.710 
refresh I would say if you're using
Justin<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.360> because<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.430> um<00:04:01.430> yeah<00:04:01.820> see<00:04:02.420> I

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
Justin that because it's um yeah see I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.970 
Justin that because it's um yeah see I
think<00:04:03.019> it<00:04:03.200> does<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.620> fast

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
think it does it fast

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.030 
think it does it fast
it's<00:04:04.780> um<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.959> just<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.440> zoom<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:06.890> just

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
it's um you just to zoom in you just

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.610 
it's um you just to zoom in you just
move<00:04:07.250> your<00:04:07.340> fingers<00:04:07.700> out<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.570> iPod<00:04:08.959> to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
move your fingers out like the iPod to

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.289 
move your fingers out like the iPod to
zoom<00:04:09.829> out<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.100> move<00:04:10.220> your<00:04:10.340> fingers<00:04:10.640> in<00:04:10.880> so
