pulled<00:00:32.730> looked<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.480> samurai<00:00:34.230> esque

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910

the<00:03:08.709> pizza-eating<00:03:10.060> wackiness<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.600> think<00:03:12.110> from

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the pizza-eating wackiness I think from

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.120 
the pizza-eating wackiness I think from
these<00:03:12.920> pictures<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.810> think<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.230> think<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:15.980> mean

these pictures I think I think so I mean
I<00:03:16.220> think<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:17.120> looks<00:03:17.420> like<00:03:17.630> they're<00:03:17.810> taking<00:03:17.959> it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
I think it looks like they're taking it

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.160 
I think it looks like they're taking it
down<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> much<00:03:18.830> darker<00:03:19.160> road<00:03:19.720> where<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.050> know

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
down a much darker road where you know

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.670 
down a much darker road where you know
they're<00:03:21.489> they're<00:03:22.489> battling<00:03:23.000> somehow<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.440> not

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
they're they're battling somehow and not

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.410 
they're they're battling somehow and not
you<00:03:24.920> know<00:03:25.040> hey<00:03:25.250> dude<00:03:25.549> let's<00:03:25.910> eat<00:03:26.090> some<00:03:26.239> pizza
