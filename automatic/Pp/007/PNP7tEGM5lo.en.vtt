00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.330
 we have a letter that the 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.990
 lady innocence cáceres who 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.630
 wrote to rural 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.500
 abc.com.py I want to make a point here 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.590

 they give to see be morally and automatically 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.290
 this program opens in turn we want 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.469
 tell them that sometimes rural is disseminated 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.469
 in venezuela through agro trend 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.430
 in venezuela and all the caribbean agro canal 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.070
 in incarnation you must lambaré channel 6 mi 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.670
 cable channel 25 fernando de la mora luque 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.509
 and san lorenzo and now they also talk 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.420
 juba that is channel 7 broadcasts as you see 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.159
 but we also want to tell you that if 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.180
 they want to see this program in any 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.670
 moment 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.800
 or the blocks that interest you go to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.930
 youtube they put youtube 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.450
 sometimes they put in rural and automatically 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.970
 they have the program of their preference and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.970
 Now let's answer the letter of the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.890
 lady innocence cáceres with a material 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.410
 What we did with Dr. Celso Rolón 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.930
 who does not talk about how it should be 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.619
 perform the selection and management of 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.619
 dairy cattle 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.110
 as our main problem let's say 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.060
 there are some some cows many times 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.400
 that are unproductive from the point of 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.560
 view of the production of milk by 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 example mastitis picture then 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.580
 our main control is seen let's say 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.430
 focus on producing a milk as there was 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.380
 said is to certify if a healthy milk 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.660
 then how do we produce a 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.210
 healthy milk just taking care of the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.000
 sanitary aspect that we had said and 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.010
 taking care of the management aspect of the order 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.070
 what are the handles you should have in 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.380
 the tambero counts to control that his 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.850
 animals are good in appearance 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.140
 sanitary in one of the steps the kings 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.750
 should be done let's say a control 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 routine of possible pictures of 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.000
 mastitis how can it be done 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 it can simply be done with say 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.750
 a the test the first jet is called 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.750
 the dark background is to say one that the cow 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.460
 is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.610
 praised the time you can for example 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.890
 make and perform the first jets and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.550
 fun or there are lumps within the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.170
 black surface that can we say 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.130
 direct not to a possible entity 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 of mast another very preventive aspect 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.680
 important is control what 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.930
 we call a mastitis its 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.660
 clinic the mastitis your clinic is a 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.490
 mastitis that by the symptoms is not seen 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.280
 that is, it is an asymptomatic mastitis 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.800
 what can be detected with a test 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.670
 simple that is called california 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.990
 mastitis california test then 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.350
 we know you mix 2 ml of milk with 2 ml 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.560
 of the reactive triangle and already at the foot of the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.910
 cow can be detected let's say those 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.960
 possible problems of the one of the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.320
 farc 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.970
 it's a simple job you can do it 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.700
 The campero can do it on 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.260
 computer is trained there is no 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.600
 kind of drama and you can go recording 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.320
 the forms for which we want 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.780
 make this record because just the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.810
 point is to see the tip of the air is 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.960
 just what we see 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.500
 in a clinical mastitis however the 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.740
 biggest problem is what is called 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.040
 the mastitis your clinic at the time of 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.460
 Acquiring animals is very important 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.090
 attend several aspects the doctor rolón 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:25.500
 talks to us about some of those points 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.350
 and another aspect to take into account 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.720
 that we decided as technicians 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.449
 we recommend the producers 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.580
 especially 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.979
 to those who are going to start with the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.670
 activity tambera of the acquisition of 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.550
 good cows will want cows 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.920
 some aspects have to be taken into account 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.790
 first of all 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.790
 first 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.370
 rule out that the cow is sick 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.860
 in a few words we must buy cows 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.139
 healthy, good, we buy our house 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.660
 we are taking a very important step 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.090
 do our future production then 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.630
 is the side we need that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.570
 the producer has let's say 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.250
 the certainty that this disbursement of 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.230
 money that is going to be that investment that goes 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.840
 to be in your future we have a success 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.830
 short medium term especially 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.290
 we must rule out three aspects 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.140
 In my opinion we should rule out 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.570
 tuberculosis is to say with a simple 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.060
 may it's called tuberculosis 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.670
 action made by a technician logically 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.720
 it checks if that state cow does not 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.510
 she is sick 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.300
 then cows with tuberculosis or not 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.630
 it must be discard or work another 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.860
 aspect is to rule out brucellosis cows 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.270
 and let's say cruise the icas are they react 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.430
 positive tests normally now a 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.590
 blood serum sample then 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.180
 extra blood and the serum is used in 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.300
 the laboratories that we have our 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.250
 means then it does not guarantee us say 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.130
 that aspect the cow is free of 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.020
 brucellosis and tuberculosis another aspect 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.690
 that we can and are a little more demanding 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.760
 we can also be leaving the 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.590
 blood in blood sample used 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.590
 serum and we can discard what 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.260
 it is also called bovine leukosis 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.820
 that is to say are say entities are 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.540
 diseases especially the two 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.710
 first brucellosis and tuberculosis 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.020
 disease is too important 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.040
 public health point of view and how 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.860
 we said 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.860
 start we must guarantee a milk 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.420
 let's say healthy a certified milk that 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.420
 reach the consumer 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.090
 one 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.650
 t
