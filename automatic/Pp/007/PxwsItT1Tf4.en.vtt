00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
with ease of course this is a zombie

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.510 
with ease of course this is a zombie
model<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:08.259> clockwork<00:02:09.259> model<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:10.190> has<00:02:10.340> been

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
model and clockwork model it has been

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.150 
model and clockwork model it has been
repainted<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.150> little<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:11.590> here<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.620> there<00:02:12.920> in

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
repainted a little bit here in there in

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.390 
repainted a little bit here in there in
its<00:02:13.670> history<00:02:13.819> but<00:02:14.239> on<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> whole<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.770> think<00:02:16.130> its

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
its history but on the whole I think its

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.790 
its history but on the whole I think its
original<00:02:16.580> paint<00:02:16.940> work<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.390> pretty<00:02:17.630> much<00:02:17.780> as<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
original paint work is pretty much as it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.330 
original paint work is pretty much as it
was<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:24.709> one<00:02:24.860> with<00:02:25.010> his<00:02:25.100> last
