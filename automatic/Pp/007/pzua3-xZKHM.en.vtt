this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> comparison<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.450> overdrive

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
this is a comparison of to overdrive

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
right is the super overdrive from boss

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.070 
right is the super overdrive from boss
and<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.320> from<00:00:25.590> 1982<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.849> I'm<00:00:27.689> playing<00:00:27.900> on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and that is from 1982 and I'm playing on

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
and that is from 1982 and I'm playing on
a<00:00:28.109> Fender<00:00:28.439> Stratocaster<00:00:28.710> into<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> Vox<00:00:29.609> ac30

a Fender Stratocaster into a Vox ac30

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.830 
a Fender Stratocaster into a Vox ac30
here's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.349> clean<00:00:31.529> signal

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110 

all<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.470> start<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:38.100> sd1<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.030> then

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
all right start with the sd1 and then

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
all right start with the sd1 and then
we'll<00:00:39.240> go<00:00:39.390> back<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.600> forth<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.160> pedals

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
we'll go back and forth and the pedals

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.910 
we'll go back and forth and the pedals
are<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> true<00:00:42.030> bypass<00:00:42.390> looper<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.140> each

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
are in a true bypass looper so each

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.800 
are in a true bypass looper so each
pedal<00:00:44.220> did<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.640> affect<00:00:44.970> each<00:00:45.120> other's<00:00:45.450> tone
