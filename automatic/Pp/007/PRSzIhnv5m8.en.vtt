00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.180
 for the banks the montepaschi case 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.760
 derivatives bank the bank of italy 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.740
 asking for more powers to control 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.510
 to hunt down the bad guys if necessary 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.880
 directors of credit institutions 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.530
 you of new strength on bankitalia soon 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.630
 you will have ad hoc proposals between the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.180
 I put back that there is a great novelty that 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.550
 it is not known to the country that was hidden 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.520
 I am a former magistrate or one 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 extraordinary says left there in 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.640
 I make a pact between the left and this one 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.100
 political area that to the following connotations 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.859
 and against all occult power and against 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.729
 masonry and for an idea of ​​sovereignty 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:42.129
 modern monetary policy and is also in favor 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:44.260
 of a project that will revive 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.879
 this country starting from the analysis 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.579
 correct 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.280
 the correct analysis is not tactical and 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.879
 historical we are at the end of a journey 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 lasted in Europe since last 60 years since 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.079
 historical point of view 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.549
 we are running out of what is one 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 structural crisis almost 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:07.780
 irreversible and not a being 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.050
 cassandra public debt of the states 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.870
 was created by indebting states in the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.060
 world Mediterranean states through 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.300
 a coin in the hands of large groups 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.630
 financial to goldman paid sachs of 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.150
 race by the president of the mountain council 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.320
 which acted according to the logic that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.580
 of course she also goes 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.400
 responsibility for what he is saying 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.070
 in company clearly for news 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.690
 public that there was a payment of 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.550
 a large sum due like 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.400
 debt of the Italian state towards 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.850
 abroad the logic of which I speak is the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.820
 following Italians listen to me and if you do 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.880
 says a man who knows this data 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.280
 take note the coin does not belong 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.920
 to banks, money is a tool 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 to have this item exchanged 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.000
 and this other object until it is exchanged 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.930
 between subjects one must return 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.479
 other 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.490
 we have a rigged managed system 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.950
 from above with shots of spreads with blows of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.300
 financial missions with strokes of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.609
 debt that leads to them 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.430
 big international financial leaders 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.900
 who have polluted destroyed and brought 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.540
 adrift 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.120
 our country between stragismo and version 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.769
 unconventional and other activities and is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.079
 for this that our of the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.849
 nationalization of the banks of the 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.099
 coin that represents the instrument for 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.750
 give a social life to the people of a 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.970
 check for the elderly June assigns to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.819
 young people and from a perspective of the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.590
 birth with obvious must be addressed 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.650
 acknowledging that it is necessary to restart 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.269
 from the one as the place where the state in 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.939
 close to the people ie the size 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.400
 national for a new Europe against 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.430
 the Europe of the banks of power 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.930
 violent and occult vertices and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.239
 activities that have reduced ours 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.069
 country how they reduced it to a 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.639
 path that has lasted for 20 years and that 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.260
 began with the massacre of capable 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.709
 and the subsequent massacre of the street 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.859
 of amelio 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.620
 It is true to explain why pressure 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.870
 the tax threshold to more than 45 percent 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.700
 50 percent psychological is not 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.319
 far away there is the risk of hitting like 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.299
 someone says the wealth spread there 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.159
 rather the wealth of ordinary people 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.470
 than that 10 percent of super rich 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.019
 who holds half the country's wealth 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.090
 there is the certainty that the taxes become 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.239
 a tool to block development 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.120
 of the country to block the economy but the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.069
 taxes are the product of debt not 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.060
 tool that must solve the node of the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.310
 debt because the whole expense node 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 revolves around the question that 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.440
 the issuance of money and debt 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.750
 of the country create a dependency on 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.459
 large financial groups 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.530
 we must explain to the Italians that there is 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.220
 a historical trick I will remember a sentence 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.829
 of rothschild of 1805 give me the power 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.840
 to print the coin and I will check 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.250
 all political variables 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.859
 that's why I feel slightly 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.049
 strange compared to this debate 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.949
 because the new political force that I 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.530
 here dishonorably I represent proposes 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.989
 to have a national currency not for 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.479
 go back but for the future of 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.549
 make a tax policy that 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.930
 substantially redistributive and 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.449
 compensation but in a framework 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.419
 completely different issue currency 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:24.090
 that does not undue and put it with system 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.560
 autonomous banking connect to countries 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.010
 who fortunately refused the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.200
 debt 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.750
 public as well as the small Iceland 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.640
 from other countries of the world take off from 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.370
 greatest historical blackmail ever occurred 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.470
 mind you italy goes towards a decline 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.110
 this cloth was partly built 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.360
 insufflato I also talk about performance 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.280
 of the funds and a series of activities or 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.030
 hidden things that led to this 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.000
 situation 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.670
 the only way to get out of it is a policy 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.390
 that raises and makes ours independent 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.870
 country 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.100
 agriculture that employs young people 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.410
 which also invests in technology 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.540
 hidden because we are even 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.890
 arrived in a historical phase that the 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.200
 possibility of human development 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.230
 they are relegated to secret laboratories 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.140
 or in the intellectual debate that for 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.390
 internet luck allows but hidden 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.670
 to state opportunities 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.880
 we are still in the hands of this great 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.120
 project that sees the fold of Europe 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.050
 Mediterranean and sees bent and risen in the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.060
 our country 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.880
 therefore it is simply necessary to take 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.550
 I note that to get out of everything this is necessary 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.980
 a national currency financing of 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.950
 social and family activities 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.770
 because it is useless to turn around a thousand euros 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.340
 for each family are possible 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.190
 no, because they are debt to banks 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.720
 a thousand new currency and I say new 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.210
 they mean a social policy 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.160
 through an expense policy and a 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.560
 autonomous spending power was already 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.900
 done in history but also this vi 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.440
 they hide Italians wake up 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.860
 enough with controlled political caste 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.960
 by the international oligarchic powers e 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.560
 now bring out correct choices in the 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.560
 your interests
