00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
they were kids like for example for me

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
they were kids like for example for me
it<00:01:44.610> would<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.970> definitely<00:01:45.570> 30<00:01:45.869> before<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it would it's definitely 30 before I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.109 
it would it's definitely 30 before I
never<00:01:46.860> played<00:01:47.130> devil<00:01:47.399> may<00:01:47.490> cry<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.060> a

never played devil may cry when I was a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
never played devil may cry when I was a
kid<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.299> hated<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.750> game<00:01:49.049> never<00:01:49.680> played

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
kid I hated that game never played

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
kid I hated that game never played
really<00:01:50.159> thief<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:51.000> too<00:01:51.149> young<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
really thief because I was too young and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
really thief because I was too young and
then<00:01:52.560> tomb<00:01:52.829> raider<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.280> never<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
then tomb raider which never really

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.039 
then tomb raider which never really
interested<00:01:54.000> me<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.329> i<00:01:54.509> still<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.990> think

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
interested me and i still don't think

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.990 
interested me and i still don't think
it's<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.380> fantastic<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> quite<00:01:56.640> honest

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it's that fantastic to be quite honest

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.810 
it's that fantastic to be quite honest
but<00:01:57.119> anyways<00:01:57.479> point<00:01:58.140> being<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.399> seems

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
but anyways point being is that it seems

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
but anyways point being is that it seems
like<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.180> been<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.450> trend<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.229> reboots

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
like there's been this trend of reboots

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
like there's been this trend of reboots
lately<00:02:02.490> where<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.329> missed<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.810> on

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
lately where if you're missed down on

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.319 
lately where if you're missed down on
something<00:02:04.290> perhaps<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:05.790> they're<00:02:06.149> going<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
something perhaps then they're going to

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.499 
something perhaps then they're going to
give<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> opportunity<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.799> fully<00:02:08.039> real

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
give you the opportunity in a fully real

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.570 
give you the opportunity in a fully real
reimagined<00:02:09.509> world<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:10.649> replay<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.160> game<00:02:11.370> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
reimagined world to replay this game in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.900 
reimagined world to replay this game in
a<00:02:11.670> new<00:02:11.819> light<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.480> think

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
a new light and I'm think

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.070 
a new light and I'm think
what<00:02:13.180> if<00:02:13.390> bethesda<00:02:14.490> remade<00:02:15.490> fought<00:02:16.270> one<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:16.990> a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
what if bethesda remade fought one in a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.340 
what if bethesda remade fought one in a
3d<00:02:17.650> universe<00:02:18.220> instead<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.120> making<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.810> fourth

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
3d universe instead of making a fourth

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.780 
3d universe instead of making a fourth
fallout<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:22.440> what's<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.560> called<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:24.010> Boston

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
fallout in what's it called in Boston

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.850 
fallout in what's it called in Boston
like<00:02:24.910> we're<00:02:25.090> imagining<00:02:25.270> it'll<00:02:25.660> be<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.590> reason

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
like we're imagining it'll be the reason

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.110 
like we're imagining it'll be the reason
this<00:02:26.950> thought<00:02:27.160> crossed<00:02:27.400> my<00:02:27.490> mind<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:27.910> mainly

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
this thought crossed my mind was mainly

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.700 
this thought crossed my mind was mainly
because<00:02:28.360> i<00:02:28.480> saw<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> comment<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.530> i've<00:02:29.680> seen

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
because i saw a comment on it i've seen

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.670 
because i saw a comment on it i've seen
a<00:02:29.950> few<00:02:30.070> of<00:02:30.280> them<00:02:30.520> for<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.150> Bethesda<00:02:31.720> has<00:02:31.930> fully

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
a few of them for and Bethesda has fully

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.010 
a few of them for and Bethesda has fully
claimed<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> rights<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.300> entire<00:02:34.600> Fallout

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
claimed the rights to the entire Fallout

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.480 
claimed the rights to the entire Fallout
series<00:02:35.050> now<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.950> they're<00:02:36.100> working<00:02:36.430> on

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
series now and they're working on

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.640 
series now and they're working on
getting<00:02:36.640> fought<00:02:36.940> 12<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.720> tactics<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.260> steam

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
getting fought 12 and tactics on steam

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.470 
getting fought 12 and tactics on steam
so<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:39.400> why<00:02:39.550> that's<00:02:39.850> kind<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.180> why<00:02:40.330> my

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
so that's why that's kind of like why my

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.510 
so that's why that's kind of like why my
theory<00:02:40.810> backfires<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.500> little<00:02:41.800> bit<00:02:41.950> but<00:02:42.400> it's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
theory backfires a little bit but it's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.470 
theory backfires a little bit but it's
just<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.730> thought<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:42.940> crossed<00:02:43.210> my<00:02:43.390> mind

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
just a thought that crossed my mind

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000 
just a thought that crossed my mind
something<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.050> could<00:02:44.230> totally<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:44.650> being

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
something I could totally see being

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.040 
something I could totally see being
possible<00:02:45.490> because<00:02:45.820> i<00:02:45.850> know<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.360> fallout<00:02:46.690> 1<00:02:46.900> and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
possible because i know in fallout 1 and

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.290 
possible because i know in fallout 1 and
2<00:02:47.200> explains<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.280> lot<00:02:48.460> of<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> war<00:02:48.910> wearing

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
2 explains a lot of the war wearing

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.510 
2 explains a lot of the war wearing
three<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.930> does<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.740> new<00:02:50.890> vegas<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:51.340> well

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
three it does and a new vegas as well

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.180 
three it does and a new vegas as well
but<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.540> kind<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.810> does<00:02:53.050> rely<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.890> know

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
but it kind of does rely on you to know

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.330 
but it kind of does rely on you to know
where<00:02:54.700> these<00:02:54.940> monsters<00:02:55.600> came<00:02:55.810> from<00:02:56.140> how<00:02:56.890> what

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
where these monsters came from how what

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.090 
where these monsters came from how what
they<00:02:57.460> were<00:02:57.520> before<00:02:57.790> there<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.860> very

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
they were before there and it's very

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.430 
they were before there and it's very
hard<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.400> really<00:03:00.580> find<00:03:00.850> out<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.210> game<00:03:01.570> it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
hard to really find out in game it's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.140 
hard to really find out in game it's
very<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:02.890> probably<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.280> lot<00:03:03.430> easier<00:03:03.640> if<00:03:04.030> you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
very it's probably a lot easier if you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.910 
very it's probably a lot easier if you
played<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.510> right<00:03:04.540> from<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.050> start<00:03:05.200> one<00:03:05.740> and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
played it right from the start one and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.250 
played it right from the start one and
two<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> tactics<00:03:06.790> maybe<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.660> find<00:03:07.900> out<00:03:08.080> what

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
two and tactics maybe to find out what

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.570 
two and tactics maybe to find out what
happened<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.710> i<00:03:08.740> was<00:03:08.920> thinking<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.310> know<00:03:09.340> what

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
happened so i was thinking you know what

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.940 
happened so i was thinking you know what
if<00:03:09.780> bethesda<00:03:11.160> redid<00:03:12.160> fallout<00:03:12.610> 1<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.950> 3d

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
if bethesda redid fallout 1 in a 3d

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.400 
if bethesda redid fallout 1 in a 3d
world<00:03:15.160> um<00:03:15.400> now<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.360> chances<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:16.840> obviously

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
world um now the chances are obviously

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.870 
world um now the chances are obviously
very<00:03:17.500> slim<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.100> reason<00:03:18.370> i<00:03:18.430> say<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:18.670> is

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
very slim the reason i say that is

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.690 
very slim the reason i say that is
because<00:03:19.060> i<00:03:19.480> believe<00:03:19.870> fallout<00:03:20.320> 1<00:03:20.590> did<00:03:21.459> take

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
because i believe fallout 1 did take

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.850 
because i believe fallout 1 did take
place<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:24.420> california<00:03:25.420> or<00:03:25.590> somewhere<00:03:26.590> near

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
place in in california or somewhere near

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.520 
place in in california or somewhere near
there<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.610> close<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:29.380> new

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
there so that is close to where new

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.000 
there so that is close to where new
vegas<00:03:29.920> took<00:03:30.100> place<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.580> Nevada<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
vegas took place in Nevada so the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.000 
vegas took place in Nevada so the
difference<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.550> land<00:03:33.820> layout<00:03:34.270> would<00:03:34.600> be<00:03:35.010> not

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
difference in land layout would be not

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.060 
difference in land layout would be not
that<00:03:36.040> close<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.850> be<00:03:37.150> very<00:03:37.390> similar<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:38.680> could

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
that close to be very similar I could

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.320 
that close to be very similar I could
definitely<00:03:39.190> see<00:03:39.490> like<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.850> shores<00:03:40.150> of

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
definitely see like the shores of

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.910 
definitely see like the shores of
California<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:41.080> stuff<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.380> would<00:03:41.620> be<00:03:41.709> kind

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
California and stuff that would be kind

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.229 
California and stuff that would be kind
of<00:03:41.980> cool<00:03:42.040> but<00:03:42.280> once<00:03:42.459> again<00:03:42.580> I've<00:03:42.820> never<00:03:43.000> played

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.770 
game based off the gameplay I've seen
it's<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.920> lot<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.250> brown<00:03:48.580> it's<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.300> lot<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.600> just

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
would be an interesting idea but it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.020 
would be an interesting idea but it
would<00:04:10.270> get<00:04:10.420> me<00:04:10.450> just<00:04:10.840> as<00:04:11.050> mad<00:04:11.200> as<00:04:11.560> if<00:04:11.770> fith<00:04:12.640> ESDA
