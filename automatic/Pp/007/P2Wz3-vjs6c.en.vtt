building<00:00:27.570> things<00:00:27.930> anything<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:30.119> has

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.569 
building things anything if it if it has
gears<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.619> moves<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.130> that's<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.460> it's

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
gears and moves and that's what it's

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.240 
gears and moves and that's what it's
supposed<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.030> love<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.690> build<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.250> started

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
supposed to I love to build it started

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.330 
supposed to I love to build it started
out<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.600> radio<00:00:36.600> controlled<00:00:36.840> airplanes<00:00:37.380> just

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
out with radio controlled airplanes just

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.400 
out with radio controlled airplanes just
because<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> was<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.360> me<00:00:39.480> magic<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.230> that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
because it was to me magic to see that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.709 
because it was to me magic to see that
stuff<00:00:40.590> fly<00:00:40.829> around<00:00:40.980> years<00:00:41.430> ago<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.360> started

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
stuff fly around years ago and I started

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.680 
stuff fly around years ago and I started
building<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.230> big<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.789> said<00:00:45.180> man<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> could

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
building so big that I said man I could

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.869 
building so big that I said man I could
put<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> grandkid<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.340> then

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
put a grandkid on one of these and then

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.240 
put a grandkid on one of these and then
I<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.539> started<00:00:49.020> thinking<00:00:49.590> well<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.770> could<00:00:50.070> build

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
I I started thinking well I could build

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160 
I I started thinking well I could build
my<00:00:50.370> own<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> built<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.300> own<00:00:51.329> airplane<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
my own so I built my own airplane then I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
my own so I built my own airplane then I
built<00:00:52.379> another<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:54.239> 1990<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
built another one and then in 1990 I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020 
built another one and then in 1990 I
built<00:00:55.320> my<00:00:55.440> third<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.430> ten-year-old

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
built my third one with my ten-year-old

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770 
built my third one with my ten-year-old
son<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.760> we<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.180> flown<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
son and and we have now flown that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
son and and we have now flown that
airplane<00:01:01.199> enough<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.250> were<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
airplane enough that if we were going on

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.149 
airplane enough that if we were going on
a<00:01:02.910> straight<00:01:03.180> line<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:04.019> would<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.589> 13th

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
a straight line we would be on our 13th

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.179 
a straight line we would be on our 13th
time<00:01:05.400> around<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> world<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.950> we've<00:01:07.950> been

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
time around the world and we've been

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
time around the world and we've been
just<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.640> over<00:01:08.850> having<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> good<00:01:09.450> time<00:01:09.689> with

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
just all over having a good time with

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
just all over having a good time with
that<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> needs<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.030> good

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that but it has to it needs to be good

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
that but it has to it needs to be good
weather<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> hangar<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
weather and you have to go to hangar and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.469 
weather and you have to go to hangar and
all<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
all that this you can do out in the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.590 
all that this you can do out in the
garage<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> built<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> dune<00:01:18.210> buggying

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
garage and so I built the dune buggying

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.649 
garage and so I built the dune buggying
and<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.930> built<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and I built this one and I think I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
and I built this one and I think I
probably<00:01:21.869> build<00:01:22.320> an<00:01:22.439> oven<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.860> thinking<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
probably build an oven I'm thinking like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.710 
probably build an oven I'm thinking like
a<00:01:23.400> Lamborghini<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.299> something<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> know

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.080 

called<00:01:32.720> Ariel<00:01:33.170> Atom<00:01:33.320> top<00:01:33.710> here<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.640> has<00:01:35.060> a

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
called Ariel Atom top here it has a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.969 
called Ariel Atom top here it has a
Honda<00:01:35.540> motor<00:01:35.900> in<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.200> but<00:01:36.350> it's<00:01:36.590> still<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
Honda motor in it but it's still the

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.170 
Honda motor in it but it's still the
same<00:01:37.420> CC<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.810> it's<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.440> 2<00:01:39.680> liter<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.280> they

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
same CC it's a it's a 2 liter and they

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.210 
same CC it's a it's a 2 liter and they
make<00:01:41.390> about<00:01:41.630> 300<00:01:42.290> horsepower<00:01:42.440> after<00:01:43.100> they

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
make about 300 horsepower after they

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.370 
make about 300 horsepower after they
supercharge<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.300> get<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.540> all<00:01:44.659> going<00:01:45.260> in

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
supercharge it and get it all going in

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.840 
supercharge it and get it all going in
which<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.710> lot<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.070> horsepower<00:01:46.280> for<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> car

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
which is a lot of horsepower for a car
