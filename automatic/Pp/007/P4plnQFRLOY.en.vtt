itself<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:07.320> if<00:03:07.440> you're<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.950> surface

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
itself up so if you're up on the surface

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.120 
itself up so if you're up on the surface
you<00:03:08.970> tweak<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.690> runs<00:03:10.080> down<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.709> lifts<00:03:10.980> up

once<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.090> pull<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.510> down<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.170> stays<00:03:13.470> down

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
once you pull it down and it stays down

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.130 
once you pull it down and it stays down
low<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.700> tweak<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.269> stays<00:03:15.540> low<00:03:15.810> it
