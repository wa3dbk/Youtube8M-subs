00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello welcome especially side to take age disassembly dard ssb 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.110
 the goal is none other than the force I was 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.530
 two bodies some 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.629
 and 16 dec 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.730
 en scene force of 1280 who exploit intel chips in account 100 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.560
 synchronous nanometers and that promise 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.739
 like many of his children's gates his world record 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.379
 per second in reading 75 MB per second in writing and over 85 thousand 

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:28.089
 pilots 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.670
 safe capkin writing 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.470
 we unpack right now we'll talk a little bit later we have to take 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.960
 posing for jesters euros for this model and in the world via a chip of 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.470
 synchronous type must provide better data performance 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.650
 accor gave in on the most 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.519
 current as the boot 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.760
 loading files and things like that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330
 we start with the adapter becomes more and more beautiful 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.680
 3 25 inches with this mind the truck adapter and that is targeted 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.190
 of the brand 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 then unlike other estrosi 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.300
 who is well protected in his finistÃ¨re and who arrived in a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.670
 short version 120 gigas like the ardor of the young people of apr the thing for marcq 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.830
 it's the hull 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.160
 aluminum that is worn for auch frankly is the most beautiful effect 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.680
 especially below 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.050
 we call black brushed aluminum and it is terribly 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.750
 nice connectors for them knows it is necessary to get stuck 3 - the bridge 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.750
 yes this tax as shield 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.770
 three free passes to dismount 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 nothing very complicated a half-lap track 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.670
 four little girls withdraws 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 he was very small 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.650
 from this whim 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.770
 normally we should have some for our young people 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.620
 small 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.220
 in order to be able to separate the pcb from the dubai 16 dec fund 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 we notice the pcb and shorter than usual 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.970
 she is on our list 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.940
 stressful a note 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.040
 does not have them drop at the same time as we blew up the 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.939
 guarantee some little stickers not touch my thing 4 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.639
 vice-champions 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.789
 so here we are in front of the pcb 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.859
 we have here the connectors 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.689
 the controller we have this time of 2280 and finally the eight chips that are so 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.539
 intel 25 nanometers 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.259
 Synchronous type 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.499
 that's what we could say 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.609
 for today 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.930
 just have to wait for the full test of what this strong talk can make you 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.439
 an idea about this product on this bridge is telling you see you soon 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.099
 especially side
