00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 

I<00:01:50.670> guess<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> Autobots<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.560> hurry<00:01:52.830> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I guess the Autobots are in a hurry to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 
I guess the Autobots are in a hurry to
save<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.400> mini-cons<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> weird

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
save the mini-cons and I get a weird

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.870 
save the mini-cons and I get a weird
feeling<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:55.890> something<00:01:56.220> big<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
feeling that something big is about to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.450 
feeling that something big is about to
happen<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.960> means<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> Decepticons<00:01:59.160> can't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
happen which means the Decepticons can't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.540 
happen which means the Decepticons can't
be<00:01:59.610> too<00:01:59.790> far<00:02:00.090> away

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.120 

so<00:02:09.240> uh<00:02:09.270> any<00:02:09.780> ideas<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.470> big<00:02:10.650> secret<00:02:11.040> is

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130
