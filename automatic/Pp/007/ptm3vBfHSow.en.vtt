an<00:04:17.709> E

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:41.570 

so<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.600> goes<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.020> part<00:04:25.260> goes<00:04:25.410> like<00:04:25.560> this

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.529 

okay<00:04:42.449> so<00:04:42.720> that's<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.199> whole<00:04:43.409> part<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.539> I'm

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
okay so that's that whole part the I'm

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.089 
okay so that's that whole part the I'm
not<00:04:45.720> sure<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:45.930> that's<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.229> ver<00:04:46.500> sir<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.770> think

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
not sure if that's the ver sir I think

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.610 
not sure if that's the ver sir I think
that's<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.400> chorus<00:04:47.879> but<00:04:48.870> I'm<00:04:49.020> not<00:04:49.199> completely

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
that's the chorus but I'm not completely

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.760 
that's the chorus but I'm not completely
sure<00:04:50.689> so<00:04:51.689> let's<00:04:51.840> just<00:04:51.960> call<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.289> next<00:04:52.560> part

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.309
