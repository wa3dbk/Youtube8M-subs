00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello together today I show you how 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:10.639
 you add the fractions we have the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.639
 invoice 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:29.250
 36 this is the denominator 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:37.200
 And that's the counter first we have to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:40.079
 To find the name in the name we find 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 from what we look through everything 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 For example, you can share four 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 the eight by four part 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.420
 you can see the twelve fell through in part 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.500
 you can heal the 16 and then 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 we still look here 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 6 that can be styled by sexual 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.359
 12 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 you can divide by six and the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.439
 Darkness could be no time now 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.710
 keep going but we already have that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.689
 Common names found 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:18.780
 the 12 and we already know that 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:25.259
 the common denominator she is twelve 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 Let's write the four now we have to 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.150
 the counter will get the counter 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 We get out of here four times something 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.170
 So , 12 gives 43 ag 12 so we have to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 up here three times expected three times three 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
 gives 9 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.329
 then we see six how many times 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.430
 six equals 12 so we have two times 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 Six ratios make 12 so 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:59.790
 Let's write a 2 here 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:02.909
 calculator once 22 then we count in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.040
 Say that we calculate so that we 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.280
 up here the new pt2 calculate that he 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.230
 hitzfeld 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.590
 claim then 12 then we have that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.590
 just
