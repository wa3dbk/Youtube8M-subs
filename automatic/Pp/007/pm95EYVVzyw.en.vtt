00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.820
 this is something that is not going to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.310
 like but let's go pretty fast 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 Because of this, since we continue to go to 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.230
 be the sectors to interpret the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.330
 new version of 'the fantastic 4' 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.580
 as you know after the problems of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 criticisms he had the first 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.500
 movies beyond who is here already 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 it's not that he has gone so badly fox decided 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.020
 do a rhythm of this with a face not 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.600
 so classic but rather pulling the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.550
 ultimate universe and you should know that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.830
 michael jordan will make the torch 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.140
 human being a person who is already 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.059
 semi confirmed that time but the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 pendency announced that mai stayler 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.150
 will make richter the nastic or kate shoulder 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 mara for her tomes the woman 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.600
 invisible I love the truth and chase 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.150
 level will make the mole with the thing that in 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 actually I think it does not look like it should or 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 as we all remember it because in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 reality is not that you are going to put a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 disguise as they did in the first 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.950
 movie but they're going to do this 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.659
 monster in the same way that by 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 example makes a meeting today with 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.229
 stop motion and you 're done 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.609
 he already has experience in this field 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.429
 after having worked in the 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:29.189
 tinkle movie that you think these 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.210
 choices and changes into something the very 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.510
 little hope they had of it 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.549
 well look at the fantastic four 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.760
 I never read of them but here they were a 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.850
 group that particularly attracted me but 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.590
 what do see greene ie Cabbage 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.360
 mole before becoming the annoying 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.340
 as ben grimm he was already a guy 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.659
 muscular and good is basically what 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.460
 I was just talking about the woman 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.500
 wonder and what would happen if someone 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.720
 puts a very thin guy to make 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 superman or screen is supposed to 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.930
 Muscled soler to a soccer player 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.060
 american and he was strong so put 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.009
 that guy I really do not like we're going to 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.100
 see what I think also that of the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.770
 brothers now with the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.860
 with the different one since there is no but good 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.540
 that's running 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.100
 to the woman the presence is not the aspect 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 in what they put it in that they put it 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.970
 most of the comics I always imagined 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.590
 something like that 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.690
 basically Britney Spears makes a few 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.270
 years so really private me 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.030
 annoying the actress they put and good 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.560
 richards at least half nerd looks 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.480
 that we say accept the feeling that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.980
 he's a very studious guy so I do not 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.750
 I'm going to complain a lot about that and I know it's 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.360
 obvious that they want to make a version 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.010
 hot a young version as you say in the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.410
 universe lately this is not the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.610
 four fantastic adults although they are 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.890
 the fantastic four with these 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.300
 starting this was your future be better 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.600
 that the one who were in the universe 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.459
 last and but good, definitely 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.780
 I hope your future is better than 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.830
 they had in the movies because 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.230
 Really 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.150
 I believe that if the movies really 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.410
 I did not like them but as I say that 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.120
 I also have to say that if I'm 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.350
 changing the channel and being in the cable 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.989
 there are times I have a little left 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.730
 look at them because they have their two or three 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.770
 things that are good but 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.170
 they definitely never came to 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.209
 potential that I had something that I hope that 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.300
 is done with this movie in addition to 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.640
 that among other 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.860
 is saying that if this happens to have 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.590
 a little hook it is also possible that 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.900
 if there is a supergroup between the four 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.890
 fantastic and the x-men thing that would be 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.270
 Really good 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.250
 almost they could make a movie 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.440
 even bigger than it was the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.440
 Avengers need good for less more 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.850
 great and I hope it ends up being 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.310
 I say beyond that they are also more 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.900
 characters that I like very much to all the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.340
 movie and have them doubt that they're going 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.280
 to be good because that's what I want 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.980
 all good movie 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.500
 this summer do not miss the summer of 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.900
 the cell man discounts of up to 50% 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.020
 and if you're looking for bermuda shorts shirts 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.030
 trousers t-shirts sweaters saco sport and 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.000
 much more but you have a two for one 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.280
 if you pay for a garment and you take two 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.110
 unique opportunity we find in all 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.850
