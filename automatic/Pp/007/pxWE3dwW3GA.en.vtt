00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
in all directions I think that's the

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.949 
in all directions I think that's the
good<00:03:49.170> part<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.709> being<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.239> society<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.780> is

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
good part of being in a society that is

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.960 
good part of being in a society that is
never<00:03:52.260> truly<00:03:52.890> content<00:03:53.340> with<00:03:53.549> what<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.790> has

but the thing is that's good because we

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.319 
but the thing is that's good because we
constantly<00:04:14.100> want<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.670> innovate<00:04:14.910> we

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
because of that even though we might not

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.410 
because of that even though we might not

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
because we're always looking for the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.920 
because we're always looking for the
next<00:04:29.010> step<00:04:29.400> we're<00:04:29.820> always<00:04:30.030> innovating<00:04:30.630> as<00:04:30.900> a

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
next step we're always innovating as a

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.840 
next step we're always innovating as a
country<00:04:31.260> we<00:04:31.620> haven't<00:04:32.220> allowed<00:04:32.610> ourselves

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
country we haven't allowed ourselves

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.810 
country we haven't allowed ourselves
just<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.510> die<00:04:33.720> down<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.320> stop<00:04:34.950> developing<00:04:35.580> and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
just to die down and stop developing and

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.550 
just to die down and stop developing and
stop<00:04:36.060> growing<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.630> stop<00:04:36.870> being<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:37.350> world

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
stop growing and stop being a world

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.760 
stop growing and stop being a world
power<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:38.400> haven't<00:04:39.030> we've<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.480> simply<00:04:40.080> kept

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
power we haven't we've just simply kept

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.140 
power we haven't we've just simply kept
going<00:04:41.130> throughout<00:04:41.670> our<00:04:41.850> entire<00:04:41.940> history

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
going throughout our entire history

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.870 
going throughout our entire history
we've<00:04:42.570> just<00:04:42.810> grown<00:04:43.170> as<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.590> population<00:04:44.550> grown

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
we've just grown as a population grown

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.570 
we've just grown as a population grown
with<00:04:45.810> our<00:04:45.930> technology<00:04:46.110> grown<00:04:46.830> everything<00:04:47.400> and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
with our technology grown everything and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.240 
with our technology grown everything and
I<00:04:48.150> think<00:04:48.480> that's<00:04:48.660> that's<00:04:49.170> one<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
I think that's that's one of the the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.030 
I think that's that's one of the the
juxtapositions<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.120> see<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.840> on<00:04:52.770> one<00:04:52.980> hand

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
juxtapositions you see that on one hand

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.620 
juxtapositions you see that on one hand
if<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.430> look<00:04:53.610> at<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.790> humans<00:04:54.210> are<00:04:54.390> very

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
if you look at it humans are very

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.580 
if you look at it humans are very
selfish<00:04:55.170> very<00:04:56.420> persistent<00:04:57.420> people<00:04:57.840> but<00:04:58.470> at

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
selfish very persistent people but at

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.950 
selfish very persistent people but at
the<00:04:58.650> same<00:04:58.890> time<00:04:59.160> it's<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.790> persistence<00:05:00.150> that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
the same time it's that persistence that

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.900 
the same time it's that persistence that
lets<00:05:01.200> them<00:05:01.440> make<00:05:01.680> as<00:05:01.890> many<00:05:02.070> developments<00:05:02.640> and

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
lets them make as many developments and

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.820 
lets them make as many developments and
innovations<00:05:03.450> as<00:05:03.630> they<00:05:04.080> have<00:05:04.290> so<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.560> think

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
innovations as they have so I think

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.610 
innovations as they have so I think
that's<00:05:05.250> just<00:05:05.490> an<00:05:05.820> interesting<00:05:06.570> contrast<00:05:06.810> that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
that's just an interesting contrast that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290 
that's just an interesting contrast that
I<00:05:07.680> noticed<00:05:08.070> when<00:05:08.190> thinking<00:05:08.550> about<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.940> topic

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
I noticed when thinking about the topic

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.970 
I noticed when thinking about the topic
earlier<00:05:09.630> today<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.410> thought<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.650> just<00:05:10.830> want

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
earlier today and I thought I just want

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.260 
earlier today and I thought I just want
to<00:05:11.100> do<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.220> commentary<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:11.880> share<00:05:12.060> with<00:05:12.180> you

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
to do a commentary and share with you

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.880 
to do a commentary and share with you
