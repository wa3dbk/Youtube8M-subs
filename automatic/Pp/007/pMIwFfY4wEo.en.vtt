repair<00:01:42.960> plus<00:01:43.320> per<00:01:43.500> text<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> has<00:01:44.009> SPF<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
repair plus per text so it has SPF in it
and<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:46.520> am<00:01:47.520> always<00:01:47.909> skeptical<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.720> lip<00:01:48.899> balms

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and I am always skeptical of lip balms

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
and I am always skeptical of lip balms
because<00:01:49.560> they're<00:01:49.680> either<00:01:49.799> too<00:01:50.100> waxy<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:51.119> they

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
because they're either too waxy or they

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.639 
because they're either too waxy or they
have<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.659> irritating<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
have something irritating in them that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
have something irritating in them that
actually<00:01:53.130> makes<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.520> lips<00:01:53.700> peel<00:01:54.030> boy<00:01:55.020> like

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
actually makes my lips peel boy like

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.069 
actually makes my lips peel boy like
just<00:01:55.740> oily<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.180> oil<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.600> absorbs

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
just oily and then the oil like absorbs

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
just oily and then the oil like absorbs
really<00:01:58.290> quickly<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.840> protect

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
really quickly and so they don't protect

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.999 
really quickly and so they don't protect
very<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:03.380> as<00:02:04.380> soon<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.770> checked
