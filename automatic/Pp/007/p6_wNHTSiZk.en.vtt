and I go ahead and play the honor of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.560 
and I go ahead and play the honor of the
pure<00:00:39.379> idea<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.649> being<00:00:41.270> I'm<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> be

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
pure idea here being I'm not going to be

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.950 
pure idea here being I'm not going to be
blocking<00:00:45.570> most<00:00:46.050> likely<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.800> free<00:00:47.100> blade<00:00:47.960> but

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
blocking most likely that free blade but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
blocking most likely that free blade but
he<00:00:49.200> doesn't<00:00:49.530> play<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.070> drop<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> take

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
he doesn't play a to drop and so we take

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
he doesn't play a to drop and so we take
a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> unnecessary<00:00:55.140> damage

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
a little bit of unnecessary damage

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.959 
a little bit of unnecessary damage
perhaps<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.989> we're<00:00:58.230> able<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.280> kick<00:00:59.789> our

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
perhaps but we're able to just kick our

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.630 
perhaps but we're able to just kick our
chalice<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.829> continue<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> hold<00:01:02.100> tight<00:01:02.370> we're

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
chalice and continue to hold tight we're

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.260 
chalice and continue to hold tight we're
going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.940> value<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> night<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
going to get value out of the night and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.359 
going to get value out of the night and
