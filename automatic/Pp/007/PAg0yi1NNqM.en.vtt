00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.439
 200 degrees while baking in a bowl goes

 mix you will review how your parents are going 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.849
 If they are already golden brown, 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.099
 oven if you do not wait for about five minutes 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.470
 more when they're ready, get your parents out 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.239
 of the oven and not order your oven because 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.069
 we will continue to use now with a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.900
 large spoon you are going to add the mixture 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.370
 of the cupcakes you do not have until the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.170
 stop because the egg is going to inflate a 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.970
 little bit more when you have finished you are going to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.150
 take your tray and you will go back to 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.250
 Put in the oven for fifteen minutes or 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.630
 sixteen maximum can be ready up 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.720
 that the oven and you're going to leave 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.110
 cool for a while and then after 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.880
 you can serve 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.800
 and ready and our cupcakes for 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.930
 breakfast 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.090
 to be an idea let's make some 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.130
 mini hot cakes to prepare dough 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.320
 hot cakes I always follow the recipe that 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.510
 comes back from the box and added a 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.340
 little bit more butter like me 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.260
 I'm going to do it myself and use a 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.680
 spoon so everyone is the same 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.690
 size and when they finish doing all 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.700
 your coaches it's time to prepare them 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.500
 use the fruits that you like 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.780
 to make your skewers you first go to 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.940
 Take your stick and you will put the fruit 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.620
 after putting on the hot cakes and you go 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.430
 leaving a space to put the cream 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.380
 then if again hot fruit you're going to 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.920
 add cream between the strawberry and the 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.920
 cocktail 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.300
 at that point that you want, I did it 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.300
 of three fingers and a hot cakes 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.360
 [Applause] 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.890
 [Music] 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.170
 for the third and we will make a 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.569
 delicious wow strawberry sides for this I 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.640
 I use pasa puff pastry we can 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.560
 get in the supermarket also in 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.060
 the bakeries mozzarella cheese or 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.160
 also any other cheese that is 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.290
 melt and in this case I'm going to 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.840
 put pepperoni but you can also 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.790
 use chorizo ​​sausage or something 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 salty the first thing I'm going to do with 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.900
 Clean hands is to cut your 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.489
 impact puff in medium squares 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.750
 you are going to take your box and you are going to do it 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.729
 a little ball 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.729
 [Music] 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.870
 you're going to crush it a bit you're going to go 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.910
 accommodating on a plate when you have 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.180
 finished with a knife you are going to open them 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.830
 in half like that and with your fingers you're going to 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.630
 open a little more like this 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.700
 when you are already very open you are going to 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.150
 put the cheese without leaving the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.549
 borders and you put Peronism now the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.070
 let's close you 're going to take the tip of 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.190
 up with the bottom tip and you're going to 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.840
 close pressing down the entire shore 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.860
 you're going to put them in your water 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.110
 clear with it gone around 6 to 8 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.360
 minutes will carefully take your 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.950
 wireless and that's how they are ready 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.560
 for the next idea if you want something 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.630
 more nutritious I recommend you to do 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.700
 this the only thing that we are going to urge are hot 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.860
 medium sized cakes minced fruit 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.410
 little bits try to make them 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.690
 different colors and greek yogurt what 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.210
 is going to do is take your jockey and you're going to 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.490
 put over yogurt and then you go 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.950
 to put the fruit of a color serves 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.930
 several and of different fruit colors 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.200
 so that he looks very father is 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.200
 combination 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.550
 and now this is a very healthy idea 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.920
 to prepare some hot cakes the last 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.990
 idea is a delicious French bread and you 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.290
 I'm going to show you how this is done 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.150
 in a bowl you will empty 6 eggs one 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.280
 half tablespoon cinnamon one 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.040
 spoonful of sugar a spoonful of 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.140
 vanilla and a cup of half cream if you 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.870
 you do not get half cream you can use 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.640
 cream to beat or if not milk now with 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.680
 a balloon you're going to stir everything up very well 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.300
 this mix more sounds reaches for 10 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.160
 slices of bread when you finish 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.680
 beat very well and that there is no 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.150
 whole egg is already ready 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.250
 mix do not worry if there are still 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.320
 cinnamon lumps now you are going to take your 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.510
 slices of bread and you're going to cut them in 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.240
 Band-Aids the red bread is coca can be 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.890
 whole white butter flavor 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.230
 that you want when you finish doing 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.270
 all the sticks are going to put a pan 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.310
 with recife butter now you go to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.680
 grab the bread stick and you're going to 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.200
 dip in the mixture we made with a 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.210
 fork pull it out and drain the excess and 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.190
 you go to the pan to be cold 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.050
 when you see that it is already golden brown 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.270
 bottom part flip them so that they 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.250
 brown the bread completely when you see that 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.960
 It's crispy and all the bread you're going to 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.550
 remove and you will put it on a paper 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.729
 absorbent and so will you do with 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.500
