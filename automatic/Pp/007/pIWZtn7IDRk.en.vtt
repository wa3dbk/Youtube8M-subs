00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.559 
the way I like to do that is to chop it
up<00:01:52.149> really<00:01:52.420> fine<00:01:52.810> add<00:01:53.170> some<00:01:53.950> olive<00:01:54.340> oil<00:01:54.729> lemon

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
up really fine add some olive oil lemon

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.630 
up really fine add some olive oil lemon
juice<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.079> Celtic<00:01:56.560> salt<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.009> then<00:01:57.130> massage

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
juice and Celtic salt and then massage

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.819 
juice and Celtic salt and then massage
it<00:01:57.969> and<00:01:58.390> by<00:01:58.539> massaging<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.259> you're<00:01:59.439> breaking

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
it and by massaging it you're breaking

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.919 
it and by massaging it you're breaking
down<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.159> cell<00:02:00.399> walls<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:01.420> actually<00:02:01.780> makes

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
down the cell walls that actually makes

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.499 
down the cell walls that actually makes
it<00:02:02.049> really<00:02:02.319> digestible<00:02:03.250> where<00:02:03.880> not<00:02:04.060> only<00:02:04.090> does

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
it really digestible where not only does

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.319 
it really digestible where not only does

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
quinoa or red quinoa okay because you

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.210 
quinoa or red quinoa okay because you
get<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.299> phytonutrients<00:02:49.750> from<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.980> color

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.440 
so and I'm looking at things and I see
color<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.590> think<00:02:53.739> okay<00:02:54.310> I'll<00:02:54.400> do<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.730> blue<00:02:54.970> corn

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
color I think okay I'll do the blue corn

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.690 
color I think okay I'll do the blue corn
instead<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> white<00:02:56.470> corn<00:02:56.829> is<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.280> what

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
instead of the white corn is that what

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.370 
instead of the white corn is that what
you<00:02:57.850> would<00:02:57.970> say<00:02:58.030> that's<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.690> great<00:02:58.840> idea<00:02:59.109> and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
you would say that's a great idea and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.080 
you would say that's a great idea and
the<00:02:59.470> blue<00:02:59.650> corn<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.130> actually<00:03:00.280> closer<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
the blue corn is actually closer to the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.809 
the blue corn is actually closer to the
traditional<00:03:01.810> grain<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.739> way<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.250> evolved

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
traditional grain the way that evolved

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.030 
traditional grain the way that evolved
in<00:03:03.970> South<00:03:04.299> America

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
in South America

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.970 
in South America
know<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.640> spices<00:03:06.969> aside<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.930> think<00:03:08.739> that

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
know what spices aside I think that

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.550

cinnamon<00:03:09.909> is<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> wonderful<00:03:10.599> spice<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.260> helps

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
cinnamon is a wonderful spice it helps

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.130

to<00:03:11.680> label<00:03:12.010> eyes<00:03:12.129> your<00:03:12.340> blood<00:03:12.579> sugar<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.689> makes

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
to label eyes your blood sugar it makes

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.410 
to label eyes your blood sugar it makes
things<00:03:14.379> sweeter<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.340> think<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.909> most<00:03:16.120> food

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
things sweeter I think that most food

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.630 
things sweeter I think that most food
chefs<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.829> buy<00:03:18.040> your<00:03:18.069> spices

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
than buying them ground because once you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.990
