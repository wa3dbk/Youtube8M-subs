00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.130
 the soil sample of the agricultural school 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.300
 consists of creating a garden 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.830
 for taking soil samples one 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.680
 ph meters of avm and one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.539
 carton box with the associated 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 namely liquids a floor 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.949
 indicator and a bottle of spray bottle 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.780
 Water for cleaning the instruments 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.719
 after that, if we have a soil sample 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.239
 want to take to per determine 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:48.390
 sting with a small brick 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:51.590
 off and take a device with the fingers 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.579
 KrÃ¶mer way we were only the earth no 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.579
 plant components and no stones 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.359
 we give a few crumbs this fine 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.840
 first in the round well of the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.840
 parameters as finely as possible 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 then we give it some dripping 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.290
 Soil indicator solution so that the earth 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.290
 is being covered 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.630
 Now we wait a few seconds 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.220
 we see a slight electric shock 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.680
 you have the feeling deadly 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.890
 once that no longer can be changed 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.750
 we liquid the solution 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.369
 Carefully and slowly through the canal 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.710
 run and we prefer comparing the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.040
 color with the disclosures by bicycle 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.040
 on the website 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:05.640
 this color will be out now 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:08.299
 orange classify ph 5 the same 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.299
 show again 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.410
 In the end we would have all the rest from and 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.910
 wash the ph with the spray bottle 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.950
 or next sample and it is clean 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.239
 his 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.110
 otherwise we had a falsification 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.110
 the fourth place
