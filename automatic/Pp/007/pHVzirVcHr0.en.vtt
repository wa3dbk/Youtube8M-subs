00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi to close or video produced on 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.550
 this product you have seen 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.429
 certainly in the true title of the shine 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.030
 lancom lover especially that I owe you 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.699
 tell the truth as soon as they presented it 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 said usual product and instead I have it 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.840
 wanted to try also seen the color that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 it happened to me that it is the 120 ho never rouge 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.570
 I love it and will wear it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.050
 I show the application is very much 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 sliding is a product you see of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 those, however, semi-glossy is not super 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 super writer is bright 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 after this series of super products 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 look, it still remains a bit 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 halo when I clean I clean the hand the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.020
 immediately then this means purity 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.020
 that still on the lips a little 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.719
 lever color inside as well as 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.890
 be super smooth and even super 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 moisturizing 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.219
 there are different colors now 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.850
 sincerely among all I would have anyway 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.990
 I think bought this here because you see 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.330
 changed a little who does not respect when 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 I apply it becomes a little more intense not 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.110
 it's really a red is a strawberry red 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.280
 then of course I check one 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.080
 past it still applies stratification 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.850
 and the becomes even more polished 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 particularity that I noticed that I tell you 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.229
 on a personal level it is that even from it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.549
 a lot does not come down to me you know that I will 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.890
 I always tell that this conformation 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.810
 of the lips which often causes in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 effects when they are of the bulk you are 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 too much creamy liquid drops me 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.509
 precisely in this area 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 I have applied this by now more than 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.070
 I said to myself an occasion and it doesn't happen to me 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.590
 which also very moisturizing in fact a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.350
 of the spheres of hyaluronic acid 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.030
 inside that ensure hydration 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.399
 that goes up to doctor so it is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.899
 very nice to have it too 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.399
 on the lips it is not of those products that 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.159
 the dry ones are going now 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.969
 oily products just a kind of all 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.090
 the colors never in place of the gloss ne sto 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.770
 using sincerely I tend seems first 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.789
 always for the speech comita gift 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 the most natural ones possible therefore with 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.180
 with the neck the most neutral color o 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.379
 however almost transparent because if 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.330
 I had to do it with a red probably 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.660
 I'd find myself quas because I'm a fan 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.129
 of the colors of san donÃ  and those in 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.989
 reality stops me there they don't move me 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.239
 returning him to the oil of 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.129
 pink flies muscat fly 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.319

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.420
 rich in fatty acids 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.999
 and just inside because there is this rose 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.709

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:45.230

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.989
 a little chapped from the cold or from 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.090
