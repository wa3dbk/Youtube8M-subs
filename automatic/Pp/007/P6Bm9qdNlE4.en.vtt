00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 everyone is welcome to this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 new video where I show you how 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.040
 restore your device without 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 having to necessarily update it with 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.180
 violet a few days ago is in development 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.890
 the seed tool wiktor that precisely vi 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 allows you to restore yours 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.670
 device then to bring it back to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 original condition just like when 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 it had just come out of the box then 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.080
 delete any downloaded application 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 from the app store 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.840
 every tweak of cydia and jailbreak itself 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 but without having to update it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
 to the latest version because it can be 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.320
 very useful this because for example I 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 I have my ipod touch 4g with ice and 6.1 e 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.030
 I have to restore it for any 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.370
 reason but restoring it with ink 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.550
 I would have to update it to ios e 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 6.113 and therefore I could no longer perform 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.800
 the untethered jailbreak and therefore instead 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 do restore with iphone i can do 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 this semi restoration or the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.030
 restore using the vi method 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 I will explain now that it will restore them 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 your device 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 but to the firmware you have before 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 recovery then involved in this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 case io or ios and 6.1 10 244 and I will try to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.009
 do this if mini store 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.460
 first I'll show you that every iphone 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.100
 touch says blogger with cydia 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 installed and also quite 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 customized custom can be said 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.950
 in fact winterboard and I applied the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.780
 flat theme for courses or a lockscreen 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 very redesigned with some widgets e 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 the jalil hoc tweak that makes me the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.870
 different lockscreen similar to that of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.360
 android jelly bean 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.160
 how good of you jalil hoc works 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.100
 correctly or many notes or multi files 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.870
 inside my ipod touch and or even 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 some apps downloaded from the app 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.550
 store which for example google chrome 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 all these apps and tweaks e 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.970
 I will show you various documents 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
 they will disappear once the seeds are made 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 store but now let's see how 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.550
 we simply open silvia and we go 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.510
 su search and search and install the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.640
 tweak mobile terminal 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.260
 here it is, we install it is free and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.300
 ipod i mig boss 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.820
 we have here click on confirmation e 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.190
 expect an installation to finish one 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.540
 once done we return silvia e 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.540
 let's go on manage 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:45.010
 modification sources add and add 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.599
 this rl siri precisely but and rap 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.790
 space.com spylex info we will add e 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.650
 we are waiting for a register to be added 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.599
 once added we open it and to his 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.569
 internal we install the package to the former 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.970
 r acts then we open it click on 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:08.470
 install and then click on 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.480
 confirms and means starry 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.090
 they did return cydia back to the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.010
 home and open the terminal just 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.700
 installed at this point we write the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.760
 command rat r acts all attached in 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.650
 this way you rat and press enter a 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.590
 this point we will all appear 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.019
 series of numbers with the various writings 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.090
 options that we can then choose 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.370
 obviously each number corresponds to a 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.430
 option we should write 12 ae 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.349
 the former semi restore so let's write 12 e 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.940
 we press enter 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.389
 now he will ask us if we really want to 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.000
 continue we write the letter y and 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.139
 then we send it to start 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.139
 the semi lumi store 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.370
 perfect 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.040
 fake buy written donum reboot 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.570
 press ye again 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.240
 then we confirm with 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.240
 send our device will restart 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.239
 here it is once it restarts it will be 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.490
 English but for the moment we go 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.180
 then to do the initial configuration 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.930
 so we hear the language and wifi 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.970
 etc 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.250
 I had configured our ipod 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.750
 touch unfortunately yes 10 will still be fine 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.700
 we will not have completely removed the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.800
 jailbreak as it is impossible to 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.440
 take off without a complete reset 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.600
 But go about with net we have I 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.300
 and if 6.1 now allow the language 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.560
 Italian will just have to go on general 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.890
 international and on language 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.890
 select the Italian language of anna 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.229
 here is we have our idevice in 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.240
 italian with cydia installed but with 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.819
 removed all his clicks and all 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.039
 its extensions then an ipod touch 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.900
 practically new I don't have the notes anymore 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.530
 no longer google chrome i have nothing left 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.840
 except that silvia I remind you that ai 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.819
 the former wheels are compatible with all 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.160
 devices then iphone 5 iphone 4s 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.750
 iphone 4 iphone 3gs fifth touch ipod 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.169
 fourth generation ipod touch 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.060
 ipad 4 ipad 3 ipad 2 ipad generation 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.300
 mini and precisely allows you to do a 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.759
 together restore without losing the jpeg 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.199
 because in fact it restores it to the current one 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.840
 version of ios 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.789
 I remind you of patterns also to mine 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.500
 second android linking channel 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.229
