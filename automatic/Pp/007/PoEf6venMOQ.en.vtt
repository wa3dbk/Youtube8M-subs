lot of chaos and stuff like that since

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.590 
lot of chaos and stuff like that since
its<00:01:04.920> setting<00:01:05.489> deathmatch<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> lot

easier<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> say<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> video

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
easier for me to say to make the video

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.550 
easier for me to say to make the video
in<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:10.229> manner<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.810> yeah<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> heavy<00:01:13.380> barrel

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
in this manner and yeah the heavy barrel

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.070 
in this manner and yeah the heavy barrel
still<00:01:13.979> good<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.400> range<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.540> i<00:01:15.600> gotta<00:01:15.840> say<00:01:16.049> i

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
still good at range but i gotta say i

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
still good at range but i gotta say i
don't<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.950> any<00:01:17.159> difference<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.580> all

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

made a silencer without a doubt I mean
there<00:02:15.050> there's<00:02:15.350> there's<00:02:15.860> nothing<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.220> talk

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430

about<00:02:16.490> basically<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> silencer<00:02:18.020> just

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
about basically that the silencer just

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.070 
about basically that the silencer just
performs<00:02:18.770> exactly<00:02:18.950> or<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.180> gun<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:21.020> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
performs exactly or this gun or the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.490 
performs exactly or this gun or the
m16a3<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.540> silencer<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:24.140> foregrip

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
m16a3 with a silencer and a foregrip

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.310 
m16a3 with a silencer and a foregrip
feels<00:02:24.740> performed<00:02:25.280> extremely<00:02:25.940> well<00:02:26.320> exactly

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
feels performed extremely well exactly

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.440 
feels performed extremely well exactly
as<00:02:27.410> good<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:27.740> before<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.610> headshot

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
like the heavy barrel or the suppressor

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.190 
like the heavy barrel or the suppressor
with<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.900> foregrip<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:10.070> i<00:03:10.670> gotta<00:03:11.660> say<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
with the foregrip but i gotta say the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.980 
with the foregrip but i gotta say the
flash<00:03:12.410> suppressor<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.520> it's<00:03:14.030> nice<00:03:14.240> i<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
flash suppressor it it's nice i like it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.210 
flash suppressor it it's nice i like it
it<00:03:15.770> maybe<00:03:16.340> isn't<00:03:16.760> as<00:03:17.180> accurate<00:03:17.480> or<00:03:18.020> as<00:03:18.290> helping

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
it maybe isn't as accurate or as helping

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.140 
it maybe isn't as accurate or as helping
as<00:03:19.430> some<00:03:19.880> other<00:03:20.420> youtubers<00:03:21.020> might<00:03:21.230> suggest<00:03:21.560> i

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
as some other youtubers might suggest i

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.880 
as some other youtubers might suggest i
mean<00:03:23.150> level<00:03:23.840> cap<00:03:24.020> for<00:03:24.140> example<00:03:24.500> he<00:03:24.590> makes<00:03:24.770> some

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
mean level cap for example he makes some

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.980 
mean level cap for example he makes some
excellent<00:03:25.070> videos<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.240> i<00:03:26.330> think<00:03:26.540> he<00:03:26.630> over

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
excellent videos but i think he over

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.050 
excellent videos but i think he over
exaggerated<00:03:27.920> maybe<00:03:28.130> how<00:03:28.370> good<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.850> flash

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
exaggerated maybe how good the flash

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.180 
exaggerated maybe how good the flash
suppressor<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:30.350> might<00:03:30.560> be<00:03:30.710> better<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.980> lot

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
suppressor is it might be better a lot

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.800 
suppressor is it might be better a lot
of<00:03:31.340> guns<00:03:31.490> i<00:03:31.640> don't<00:03:31.880> actually<00:03:32.030> know<00:03:32.330> yet<00:03:32.570> since

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
of guns i don't actually know yet since

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.140 
of guns i don't actually know yet since
i<00:03:32.900> haven't<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:33.710> tried<00:03:34.010> every<00:03:34.550> gun<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.000> stuff

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
i haven't like tried every gun and stuff

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.970 
i haven't like tried every gun and stuff
like<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.330> i<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.840> concentrated<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.680> trying

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
like that i have concentrated on trying

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.610 
like that i have concentrated on trying
us<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.250> few<00:03:37.430> guns<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.750> have<00:03:38.960> changed<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
us a few guns and that have changed and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.280 
us a few guns and that have changed and
a<00:03:39.770> few<00:03:39.920> games<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.220> shouldn't<00:03:40.730> have<00:03:40.850> changed

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
a few games that shouldn't have changed

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290 
a few games that shouldn't have changed
but<00:03:42.290> i<00:03:42.380> gotta<00:03:42.590> say<00:03:42.770> it<00:03:43.040> seems<00:03:43.370> like<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:44.120> gun

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
but i gotta say it seems like the gun

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.690 
but i gotta say it seems like the gun
loses<00:03:44.960> recoil<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.590> has<00:03:45.830> less<00:03:46.070> recoil<00:03:46.340> and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
loses recoil it has less recoil and

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.550 
loses recoil it has less recoil and
that's<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:47.000> course<00:03:47.210> good<00:03:47.540> with<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.350> flash

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's of course good with the flash

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.470 
that's of course good with the flash
suppressor<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:50.000> mean<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.270> flash

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
suppressor and I mean the flash

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.930 
suppressor and I mean the flash
suppressor<00:03:50.900> hides<00:03:51.230> your<00:03:51.920> muscle<00:03:52.370> flash<00:03:52.610> but

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
suppressor hides your muscle flash but

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.590 
suppressor hides your muscle flash but
it<00:03:53.030> doesn't<00:03:53.420> hide<00:03:54.040> hide<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.400> sound<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.510> you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
it doesn't hide hide the sound so you

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.530 
it doesn't hide hide the sound so you
will<00:03:56.750> still<00:03:57.020> be<00:03:57.050> visible<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.890> map<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.390> I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
will still be visible on the map so if I

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.640 
will still be visible on the map so if I
would<00:03:59.720> choose<00:03:59.960> between<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.440> flash

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
would choose between the flash

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.470 
would choose between the flash
suppressor<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.460> suppressor<00:04:01.970> since<00:04:02.240> both

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
suppressor and the suppressor since both

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.120 
suppressor and the suppressor since both
of<00:04:02.510> them<00:04:02.810> seems<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.290> be<00:04:03.500> about<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.950> same

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
of them seems to be about the same

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.550 
of them seems to be about the same
accuracy<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:04.850> they<00:04:05.420> seem<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.690> behave<00:04:06.140> pretty

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
accuracy and they seem to behave pretty

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.340 
accuracy and they seem to behave pretty
much<00:04:06.800> exactly<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.600> would<00:04:08.600> still<00:04:08.840> go<00:04:09.020> for<00:04:09.290> the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
much exactly I would still go for the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.290 
much exactly I would still go for the
suppressor<00:04:09.830> because<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.370> does<00:04:10.700> hide<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.210> on

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
suppressor because it does hide you on

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.470 
suppressor because it does hide you on
the<00:04:11.420> map<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.560> seemed<00:04:12.830> also<00:04:13.460> like<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.210> is<00:04:14.330> a

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
the map and it seemed also like it is a

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.450 
the map and it seemed also like it is a
little<00:04:14.930> bit<00:04:15.320> better<00:04:15.560> when<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.010> comes<00:04:16.220> to

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
little bit better when it comes to

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.670 
little bit better when it comes to
spraying<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.030> praying<00:04:17.090> from<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.900> hip<00:04:18.140> hip

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
spraying and praying from the hip hip

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.300 
spraying and praying from the hip hip
firing<00:04:19.010> so

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
firing so

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.040 
firing so
I'm<00:04:21.310> using<00:04:21.670> the<00:04:21.910> laser<00:04:22.090> sight<00:04:22.450> right<00:04:22.750> here

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
I'm using the laser sight right here

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.370 
I'm using the laser sight right here
just<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.740> check<00:04:24.010> out<00:04:24.190> basically<00:04:24.670> with<00:04:25.450> no<00:04:25.840> no

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
just to check out basically with no no

just to check out basically with no no

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
heavy barrel just just a silent or just

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.680 
heavy barrel just just a silent or just
them<00:04:37.320> yes<00:04:38.320> just<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.370> laser<00:04:39.640> sight<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.150> i

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
them yes just the laser sight and i

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.860 
them yes just the laser sight and i
gotta<00:04:40.960> say<00:04:41.250> exactly<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.490> same<00:04:42.520> no<00:04:43.450> difference

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
gotta say exactly the same no difference

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.800 
gotta say exactly the same no difference
at<00:04:43.990> all<00:04:44.110> either<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:45.090> overall<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.360> seems<00:04:46.390> like

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
at all either I overall it seems like

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.320 
at all either I overall it seems like
the<00:04:47.230> gun<00:04:47.470> hasn't<00:04:47.710> changed<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.580> how<00:04:49.270> the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
the gun hasn't changed and how the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.720 
the gun hasn't changed and how the
attachment<00:04:50.200> works<00:04:50.410> on<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.830> hasn't<00:04:51.580> really

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
attachment works on it hasn't really

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.300 
attachment works on it hasn't really
changed<00:04:51.820> at<00:04:52.180> all<00:04:52.270> either<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:54.100> certainly

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
changed at all either it it certainly

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.070 
changed at all either it it certainly
seems<00:04:54.730> like<00:04:54.790> it's<00:04:55.060> basically<00:04:55.450> exactly<00:04:55.780> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
seems like it's basically exactly the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.170 
seems like it's basically exactly the
same<00:04:56.260> gun<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.950> same<00:04:57.220> attachment<00:04:57.520> with

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
useless use it with a four wave and if

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.470 
useless use it with a four wave and if
you're<00:05:42.070> gonna<00:05:42.250> kill<00:05:42.490> enemies<00:05:42.850> at<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.000> very<00:05:43.270> long

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
you're gonna kill enemies at a very long

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.440 
you're gonna kill enemies at a very long
range<00:05:43.780> use<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.830> heavy<00:05:45.040> barrel<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.669> if<00:05:46.300> you're

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
range use the heavy barrel and if you're

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.470 
range use the heavy barrel and if you're
gonna<00:05:46.660> do<00:05:47.200> it<00:05:47.230> at<00:05:47.470> mid-range<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:49.000> close

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
gonna do it at mid-range to to close

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.860 
gonna do it at mid-range to to close
range<00:05:49.780> like<00:05:50.110> here<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.880> smaller<00:05:52.330> maps<00:05:52.600> and

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
range like here and on smaller maps and

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.530 
range like here and on smaller maps and
stuff<00:05:52.960> like<00:05:53.169> that<00:05:53.230> always<00:05:54.100> used<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.940> silencer<00:05:55.120> I

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
stuff like that always used a silencer I

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.970 
stuff like that always used a silencer I
mean<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.840> flash<00:05:56.020> suppressor<00:05:56.500> seems<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.890> be

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
mean the flash suppressor seems to be

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.790 
mean the flash suppressor seems to be
good<00:05:57.160> now<00:05:57.490> but<00:05:57.960> silences<00:05:58.960> still<00:05:59.230> seems<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.620> be

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
good now but silences still seems to be

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.190 
good now but silences still seems to be
a<00:05:59.830> lot<00:06:00.130> better<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:00.850> yeah<00:06:01.510> I<00:06:01.660> recommend<00:06:02.169> the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
a lot better so yeah I recommend the

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.950 
a lot better so yeah I recommend the
silencer<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:02.980> as<00:06:03.730> usual<00:06:03.940> guys<00:06:04.390> you<00:06:04.600> can<00:06:04.780> see
