00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
out of the box to put them together you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.030 
out of the box to put them together you
got<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> snap<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.730> them<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.829> comes

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
got to snap them in them and if it comes

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.779 
got to snap them in them and if it comes
apart<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.540> snap<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.710> together<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
apart you just snap it back together the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
apart you just snap it back together the
advantage<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.539> mirror<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
advantage of this mirror is that it

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
advantage of this mirror is that it
doesn't<00:00:47.879> require<00:00:48.120> any<00:00:48.750> sticky<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.379> product

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
doesn't require any sticky back product

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.479 
doesn't require any sticky back product
or<00:00:50.219> any<00:00:51.210> gluing<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.410> mount<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.100> helmet

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
or any gluing to mount it to the helmet

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299 
or any gluing to mount it to the helmet
it<00:00:53.789> mounts<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> set<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> zip<00:00:55.320> ties<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it mounts with a set of zip ties and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
it mounts with a set of zip ties and
it's<00:00:56.820> designed<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.230> here

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it's designed so that if you see it here

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
it's designed so that if you see it here
it's<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> series<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> holes<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> hook

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's got a series of holes with a hook

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.650 
it's got a series of holes with a hook
at<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> end<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.879> allows<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> hook

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
at the end and that allows them to hook

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
at the end and that allows them to hook
up<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.899> almost<00:01:04.260> any<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> events<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
up to almost any of events on the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.520 
up to almost any of events on the
helmets<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> how<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.610> mount<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.530> you
