Haggai<00:00:00.420> muscles<00:00:00.780> here<00:00:01.050> and<00:00:01.170> today<00:00:01.319> one<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.620> you

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
Haggai muscles here and today one of you

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.379 
Haggai muscles here and today one of you
the<00:00:02.040> Mac<00:00:02.190> application<00:00:02.730> called<00:00:02.879> lens<00:00:03.120> flare

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
the Mac application called lens flare

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.660 
the Mac application called lens flare
now<00:00:03.899> let's<00:00:04.170> say<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.470> $4.99<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.490> App<00:00:05.640> Store

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
now let's say is $4.99 in the App Store

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.550 
now let's say is $4.99 in the App Store
on<00:00:06.210> they<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.720> have<00:00:06.839> another<00:00:07.140> version<00:00:07.350> called

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
on they do have another version called

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.000 
on they do have another version called
then<00:00:08.220> studio<00:00:08.820> which<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.080> $19.99<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.320> really

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
then studio which is $19.99 I really

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.350 
then studio which is $19.99 I really
don't<00:00:11.130> think<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.370> worth<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.910> think<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
don't think it's worth it I think the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.299 
don't think it's worth it I think the
only<00:00:12.389> thing<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.960> get<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> 99<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.190> like

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
only thing you get with a 99 it's like

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.269 
only thing you get with a 99 it's like

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
presets a dick design but you're in this

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.380 
presets a dick design but you're in this
regular<00:00:17.640> legislature<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.240> actually

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
regular legislature you can actually

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.720 
regular legislature you can actually
like<00:00:19.170> design<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.859> own<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.220> most<00:00:20.640> likely

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
like design your own which most likely

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
like design your own which most likely
you'll<00:00:21.150> most<00:00:21.330> likely<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.320> I'll<00:00:22.439> go<00:00:22.590> ahead

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
you'll most likely do so I'll go ahead

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980 
you'll most likely do so I'll go ahead
and<00:00:22.800> open<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> ever<00:00:24.240> use<00:00:24.480> optical

and open it up if you ever use optical

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
and open it up if you ever use optical

flares then and after effects you kind

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
flares then and after effects you kind
of<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.320> gonna<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.710> it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
of know what it's gonna look like it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.679 
of know what it's gonna look like it's
pretty<00:00:29.609> much<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> same<00:00:30.029> thing<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.539> just

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
pretty much the same thing it's just

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
pretty much the same thing it's just
cheaper<00:00:31.080> from<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> Mac<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.830> wish<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
cheaper from the Mac I wish it was a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
cheaper from the Mac I wish it was a
plugin<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.809> Photoshop<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.920> pretty<00:00:35.219> sure<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
plugin for Photoshop I'm pretty sure it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
plugin for Photoshop I'm pretty sure it
is<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> haven't<00:00:35.969> even<00:00:36.239> found<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.660> yet<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.710> if

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
is but I haven't even found it yet so if

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.860

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.590 
ratio and stretch it out and bring it
back<00:01:32.400> smaller<00:01:34.850> most<00:01:35.850> likely<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.390> kind

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
back smaller most likely for this kind

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
back smaller most likely for this kind
of<00:01:36.630> lens<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> keep<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> small<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of lens you want to keep it small you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.120 
of lens you want to keep it small you
can<00:01:38.820> control<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> brightness<00:01:39.390> by<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
can control the brightness by this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.990 
can control the brightness by this
bumping<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.649> edge<00:01:43.799> glare<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bumping it up and the edge glare which I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.249 
bumping it up and the edge glare which I
think<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> Escalade<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.720> pretty<00:01:45.899> much<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
think the Escalade is pretty much that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.870 
think the Escalade is pretty much that
thing<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.829> sits<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.280> when<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> put

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
thing that sits right here when you put

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999 
thing that sits right here when you put
in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> corner<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.320> control<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
in the corner you can control the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.980 
in the corner you can control the
brightness<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.939> don't<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.659> figure

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
brightness of that I don't really figure

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.770 
brightness of that I don't really figure
out<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.979> oh<00:01:53.780> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
out what that really is that oh this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.090 
out what that really is that oh this
thing<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.049> here<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.320> application<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.950> don't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
