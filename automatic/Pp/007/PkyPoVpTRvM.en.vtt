00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
etc as far as how the hitch pits this

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.770 
etc as far as how the hitch pits this
was<00:02:45.400> actually<00:02:45.610> concern<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.300> mine<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.720> I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
was actually concern of mine and then I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.120 
was actually concern of mine and then I
didn't<00:02:46.990> understand<00:02:47.350> how<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.680> hitch<00:02:47.860> worked

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
didn't understand how this hitch worked

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.280 
didn't understand how this hitch worked
when<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:48.970> tow<00:02:49.120> vehicle<00:02:49.480> turns<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.900> hitch<00:02:50.080> no

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
when the tow vehicle turns this hitch no

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.290 
when the tow vehicle turns this hitch no
longer<00:02:50.560> pivots<00:02:50.860> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> ball<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:52.030> said

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
longer pivots on the ball they said

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.480 
longer pivots on the ball they said
actually<00:02:52.540> when<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> tow<00:02:53.380> vehicle<00:02:53.709> exerts

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
actually when the tow vehicle exerts

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.180 
actually when the tow vehicle exerts
turning<00:02:55.090> force<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.350> see<00:02:56.560> how<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:56.980> hitch

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
turning force you can see how this hitch

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.060 
turning force you can see how this hitch
pivots<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:58.390> go<00:02:58.510> through<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> turn<00:02:59.110> okay<00:02:59.800> it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
pivots to go through a turn okay it

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.720 
pivots to go through a turn okay it
actually<00:03:00.459> turns<00:03:00.730> back<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:01.060> itself<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.739> will

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
actually turns back on itself and will

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.530 
actually turns back on itself and will
actually<00:03:03.940> reach<00:03:04.709> steeper<00:03:05.709> angle<00:03:05.890> than<00:03:06.220> this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
actually reach steeper angle than this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.610 
actually reach steeper angle than this
okay<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:07.900> see<00:03:08.080> how<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.440> hitch

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
okay but you can see how this hitch

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.949 
okay but you can see how this hitch
works<00:03:08.980> from<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.730> pivot<00:03:09.940> standpoint<00:03:10.600> there<00:03:10.810> you

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
works from a pivot standpoint there you

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.320 
works from a pivot standpoint there you
can<00:03:11.080> see<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> severity<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.910> turning

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
can see the severity of the turning

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.540 
can see the severity of the turning
angle<00:03:13.660> okay<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.709> can<00:03:14.860> imagine<00:03:15.340> right<00:03:15.489> now

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
angle okay so you can imagine right now

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.040 
angle okay so you can imagine right now
if<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.209> bumper<00:03:16.660> would<00:03:17.500> be<00:03:17.620> about<00:03:17.830> parallel

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
if the bumper would be about parallel

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.259 
if the bumper would be about parallel
would<00:03:20.050> be<00:03:20.140> about<00:03:20.290> parallel<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.760> face<00:03:22.060> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
would be about parallel to this face to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.449 
would be about parallel to this face to
this<00:03:22.390> stinger<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.380> can<00:03:23.530> see<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.830> severity<00:03:24.310> of

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
this stinger you can see the severity of

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.330 
this stinger you can see the severity of
the<00:03:25.390> angle<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.500> your<00:03:26.650> tow<00:03:26.830> vehicle<00:03:26.860> would<00:03:27.280> be

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the angle that your tow vehicle would be

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.130 
the angle that your tow vehicle would be
at<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:27.820> regards<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.450> rest<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> camper

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
at in regards to the rest of the camper

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.370 
at in regards to the rest of the camper
so<00:03:32.140> let's<00:03:32.350> set<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.890> back

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
so let's set this back

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.630 
so let's set this back
set<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.430> back<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.790> straight<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:37.550> we'll<00:03:38.550> go

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
set this back to straight and we'll go

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.170 
set this back to straight and we'll go
through<00:03:38.670> any<00:03:39.240> other<00:03:39.360> drawbacks<00:03:40.020> or<00:03:40.200> concerns

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
through any other drawbacks or concerns

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.920 
through any other drawbacks or concerns
being<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.450> weight<00:03:42.630> distribution

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
being that the weight distribution

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.950 
being that the weight distribution
Jack's<00:03:43.560> always<00:03:44.040> stay<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.520> hitch<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.120> always

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
Jack's always stay on the hitch I always

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.140 
Jack's always stay on the hitch I always
stay<00:03:46.110> on<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> trailer<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.220> only<00:03:47.610> problem<00:03:48.030> I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
stay on the trailer the only problem I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.900 
stay on the trailer the only problem I
encountered<00:03:48.440> was<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.620> when<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.190> backed<00:03:50.670> into

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
encountered was that when I backed into

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.480 
encountered was that when I backed into
a<00:03:51.000> spot<00:03:51.360> if<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.750> ended<00:03:52.080> up<00:03:52.200> at<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.530> severe<00:03:52.950> angle

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
a spot if I ended up at a severe angle

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.970 
a spot if I ended up at a severe angle
okay<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:53.910> let's<00:03:54.210> set<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> hitch<00:03:54.720> at<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.590> severe

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
okay so let's set the hitch at a severe

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.310 
okay so let's set the hitch at a severe
angle<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:57.960> see<00:03:59.030> the<00:04:00.030> distance<00:04:00.570> from<00:04:01.140> the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
angle you can see the distance from the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.230 
angle you can see the distance from the
weight<00:04:01.470> distribution<00:04:01.830> jack<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:02.940> tongue

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
weight distribution jack to the tongue

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.840 
weight distribution jack to the tongue
jack<00:04:03.920> collapses<00:04:04.920> as<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.370> angle<00:04:05.700> gets

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
jack collapses as that angle gets

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.780 
jack collapses as that angle gets
steeper<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.990> problem<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.440> ran<00:04:07.590> into<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:08.190> with

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
steeper the problem I ran into is with

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.710 
steeper the problem I ran into is with
my<00:04:08.940> jack<00:04:09.180> pad

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
my jack pad

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.740 
my jack pad
okay<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.500> was<00:04:10.790> fixed<00:04:11.790> with<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.030> pin<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
okay this was fixed with a pin to the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.440 
okay this was fixed with a pin to the
tongue<00:04:12.960> Jack<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.760> when<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.790> would<00:04:14.970> go<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.180> lower

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
tongue Jack and when I would go to lower

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.930 
tongue Jack and when I would go to lower
the<00:04:15.630> tongue<00:04:15.840> Jack<00:04:16.140> if<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:16.860> pad<00:04:17.160> was<00:04:17.670> above

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
the tongue Jack if this pad was above

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.030 
the tongue Jack if this pad was above
this<00:04:18.120> bar<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.930> wouldn't<00:04:19.260> allow<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.470> Chun<00:04:19.739> Tong

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
this bar it wouldn't allow the Chun Tong

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.040 
this bar it wouldn't allow the Chun Tong
Jack<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.430> go<00:04:20.520> all<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.670> way<00:04:20.760> down<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.900> what<00:04:22.020> I

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
Jack to go all the way down so what I

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.590 
Jack to go all the way down so what I
did<00:04:22.170> is<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.470> took<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.830> pin<00:04:23.070> out<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:24.300> simply

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
did is I took this pin out and I simply

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.660 
did is I took this pin out and I simply
raise<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.080> lower<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.350> Tong<00:04:25.530> Jack<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.400> hold

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
raise and lower the Tong Jack and I hold

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.970 
raise and lower the Tong Jack and I hold
this<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:27.480> place<00:04:27.540> once<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.350> tongue<00:04:28.530> Jack<00:04:28.770> gets

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
this in place once the tongue Jack gets

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.970 
this in place once the tongue Jack gets
below<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:30.000> weight<00:04:30.210> distribution<00:04:30.420> bars<00:04:31.110> if

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
below the weight distribution bars if

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.510 
below the weight distribution bars if
it's<00:04:32.370> in<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.580> clearance<00:04:32.910> type<00:04:33.750> situation<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:34.650> it

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
it's in a clearance type situation so it

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.040 
it's in a clearance type situation so it
was<00:04:35.670> just<00:04:35.790> one<00:04:35.880> one<00:04:36.540> slight<00:04:36.810> little

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
was just one one slight little

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.530 
was just one one slight little
modification<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:37.710> did<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:37.950> my<00:04:37.980> process<00:04:38.520> but<00:04:38.760> it

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
modification I did in my process but it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.250 
modification I did in my process but it
has<00:04:39.780> never<00:04:39.960> proved<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.890> be<00:04:40.920> an<00:04:41.280> inconvenience

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
has never proved to be an inconvenience

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.900 
has never proved to be an inconvenience
this<00:04:43.260> bar<00:04:43.560> interfering<00:04:44.310> with<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.640> tongue

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
this bar interfering with the tongue
