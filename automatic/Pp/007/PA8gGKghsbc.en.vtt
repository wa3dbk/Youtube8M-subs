00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.240
 ah 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 i 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 two 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 argos is a labrador puppy 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.320
 nine months and he came for what we 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 we handle it we call it handling the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.180
 puppy is a very nice job because 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.059
 When an owner arrives with his dog 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 and wants to know what to do gives us a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.199
 lots of options then it was given 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 a driving guide in which we include 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.570
 life routines a uniform criterion 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 physical activity then things 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 basic from my point of view are that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.180
 walk that uses walk with you that does not 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 I drag you that you feel that you stay 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.690
 still and come to come to the call 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.580
 even if it comes when you call it and 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.580
 then I can show you what you want 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.070
 we see him we show him the prize and what 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.050
 I picked up we said and we recorded it 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.659
 when he sits me we 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.819
 we give prizes 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.179
 and that we are going to repeat for some 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:30.719
 weeks or so is what we will 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.490
 make concessions for more than 15 minutes 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.200
 we have that he is already getting bored 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.640
 it's like we've crossed and everything is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.150
 What to know to read our dog 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.660
 To science 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.660
 wheel 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.280
 something very important is that obedience 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.290
 it's not up to you it's a puppy and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.330
 he's just establishing his style of 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.310
 life in an adult dog for example that 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.920
 had aggression or that urinates in 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.840
 different places or have some 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.940
 phobia you can teach him all the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.790
 exercises of the world and you will not correct 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.090
 first in a puppy we really have 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.980
 a pathology what happens is that he does not 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.720
 He knows he has to make us take 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.460
 by understanding that because the dog 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 link p.de the brings or you put 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.130
 newspaper and does and not after 15,000 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.120
 years of domestication we have modified 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.380
 countless things we have to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120
 show them where we want them to go to 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.650
 bathroom we have to teach them that the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.810
 bring the ball we have to teach them 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.110
 to walk with us a lot of 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.740
 things then the ultimate goal 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.610
 or we could start from that point is 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.800
 to diagnose 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.480
 prevent and treat behavior problems 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.480
 is what clinical theology does 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.090
