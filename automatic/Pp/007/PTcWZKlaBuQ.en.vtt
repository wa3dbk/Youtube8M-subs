00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
three of our four part series and today

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:18.100 
three of our four part series and today
it<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:03.929> time<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.350> get<00:00:04.500> some<00:00:04.740> dope<00:00:04.980> shots

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.050 

video1<00:00:19.110> we<00:00:19.680> discussed<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.730> strongly

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
video1 we discussed which strongly

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.300 
video1 we discussed which strongly
recommended<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:22.080> as<00:00:22.290> gimbal<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:22.950> camera

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
recommended as well as gimbal and camera

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.760 
recommended as well as gimbal and camera
system<00:00:23.610> in<00:00:23.760> video<00:00:24.480> 2<00:00:24.540> we<00:00:24.990> discussed<00:00:25.380> flying

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
system in video 2 we discussed flying

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.400 
system in video 2 we discussed flying
safety<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.460> best<00:00:27.030> locations<00:00:27.690> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.230> your

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
safety and best locations to get your

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.610 
safety and best locations to get your
shots<00:00:28.620> and<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.060> time<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:31.140> some

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 
shots and now it is time to get some

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.799 
shots and now it is time to get some
cinema<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.640> there<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> few<00:00:33.090> main<00:00:33.330> types<00:00:33.629> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
cinema so there are a few main types of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.820 
cinema so there are a few main types of
aerial<00:00:34.170> shots<00:00:34.379> that<00:00:34.440> you'll<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.800> in

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
aerial shots that you'll see in

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.710 
aerial shots that you'll see in
Hollywood<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.520> high-end<00:00:35.850> cinema<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> they

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
Hollywood in high-end cinema and they

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.560 
Hollywood in high-end cinema and they
range<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.050> epic<00:00:38.010> intros<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:39.090> beautiful

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
range from epic intros to beautiful

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
range from epic intros to beautiful
landscapes<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.680> car<00:00:40.949> chase<00:00:41.309> scenes<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:42.030> are

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
landscapes to car chase scenes there are

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.430 
landscapes to car chase scenes there are
so<00:00:42.330> many<00:00:42.420> different<00:00:42.809> kinds<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.199> shots<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
so many different kinds of shots that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.509 
so many different kinds of shots that
you<00:00:43.589> can<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.769> from<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> sky<00:00:44.220> and<00:00:44.250> they

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
you can get from the sky and they

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.520 
you can get from the sky and they
provide<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.150> production<00:00:45.870> value<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.409> make

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
provide this production value and make

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.219 
provide this production value and make
it<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.339> ton<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.909> money<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.390> spent<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229 
it look like a ton of money was spent to

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:50.990 
it look like a ton of money was spent to
get<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.470> shot<00:00:49.650> so<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.670> few

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
get the shot so there are a few

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.460 
get the shot so there are a few
principles<00:00:51.390> involved<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.199> getting<00:00:52.290> a

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
principles involved in getting a

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.750 
principles involved in getting a
successful<00:00:52.979> shot<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.400> we're<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> go

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
successful shot and we're going to go

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.130 
successful shot and we're going to go
over<00:00:53.790> those<00:00:54.059> elements<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
over those elements right now so the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.960 
over those elements right now so the
first<00:00:55.290> is<00:00:55.589> composition<00:00:55.949> focus<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:56.850> rule

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
first is composition focus on the rule

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.310 
first is composition focus on the rule
of<00:00:57.000> thirds<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.600> creating<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.019> really

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
of thirds and creating a really

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.710 
of thirds and creating a really
well-balanced<00:00:59.159> and<00:00:59.280> dynamic<00:00:59.850> frame<00:01:00.059> people's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
well-balanced and dynamic frame people's

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.360 
well-balanced and dynamic frame people's
eyes<00:01:00.900> are<00:01:01.110> naturally<00:01:01.589> attracted<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> symmetry

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
eyes are naturally attracted to symmetry

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
eyes are naturally attracted to symmetry
and<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:03.330> really<00:01:03.510> well-composed<00:01:03.870> image<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.769> use

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and a really well-composed image so use

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.990 
and a really well-composed image so use
that<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.309> advantage<00:01:05.370> when<00:01:05.880> you're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that to your advantage when you're

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
that to your advantage when you're
flying<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.540> when<00:01:06.750> you're<00:01:06.840> trying<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> tell<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
flying and when you're trying to tell a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
flying and when you're trying to tell a
story<00:01:07.560> second<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.580> speed<00:01:08.909> sometimes<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
story second is speed sometimes is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.360 
story second is speed sometimes is
necessary<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.530> shot<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> really

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
necessary for the shot to have a really

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.039 
necessary for the shot to have a really
fast<00:01:11.549> moving<00:01:11.850> camera<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> sometimes<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
fast moving camera and sometimes it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
fast moving camera and sometimes it's
necessary<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> move<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.100> slow<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.820> all

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
necessary for to move really slow it all

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.639 
necessary for to move really slow it all
depends<00:01:15.329> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> setting<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:16.110> subject<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
depends on the setting your subject and

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:17.870 
depends on the setting your subject and
what<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.159> final<00:01:17.250> product<00:01:17.579> to<00:01:17.759> look

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
what you want your final product to look

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
what you want your final product to look
like<00:01:18.030> next<00:01:18.539> is<00:01:18.810> motion<00:01:19.229> sometimes<00:01:19.829> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
like next is motion sometimes you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
like next is motion sometimes you
acquire<00:01:20.219> motion<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> camera<00:01:21.299> or

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
acquire motion in the camera or

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
acquire motion in the camera or
sometimes<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.289> require<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.920> subject<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
sometimes you require the subject to be

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.999 
sometimes you require the subject to be
moving<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.329> it<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.570> creates<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.409> feeling<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
moving but it all creates a feeling so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
moving but it all creates a feeling so
whether<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.579> static<00:01:27.000> sitting<00:01:27.539> in

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
whether you have it static sitting in

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.779 
whether you have it static sitting in
the<00:01:27.689> air<00:01:27.810> whether<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.890> panning<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
the air whether you have it panning it

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:30.980 
the air whether you have it panning it
all<00:01:29.939> creates<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.359> feeling<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.810> always

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
all creates a feeling so always

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
all creates a feeling so always
incorporate<00:01:31.530> motion<00:01:31.859> into<00:01:32.039> your<00:01:32.159> shot<00:01:32.399> if<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
incorporate motion into your shot if you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
incorporate motion into your shot if you
need<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:32.939> next<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.659> depth<00:01:34.140> having<00:01:34.920> foreground

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
need it next is depth having foreground

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
need it next is depth having foreground
mid-ground<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.329> background<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.020> influence

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
mid-ground and background can influence

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
mid-ground and background can influence
a<00:01:37.799> shot<00:01:38.130> greatly<00:01:38.789> that<00:01:38.969> otherwise<00:01:39.270> could<00:01:39.479> be

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
a shot greatly that otherwise could be

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
a shot greatly that otherwise could be
boring<00:01:39.960> pictures<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.890> two-dimensional<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
boring pictures are two-dimensional so

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
boring pictures are two-dimensional so
using<00:01:42.149> motion<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.929> create<00:01:43.289> an<00:01:43.679> illusion<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
using motion to create an illusion of a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
using motion to create an illusion of a
third<00:01:44.520> dimension<00:01:44.969> which<00:01:45.210> leads<00:01:45.420> us<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
third dimension which leads us to the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
third dimension which leads us to the
parallax<00:01:46.140> effect<00:01:46.469> which<00:01:46.679> involves<00:01:47.130> singling

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
parallax effect which involves singling

behind motion can greatly influence the
shot<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> feeling<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> use

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
shot in the feeling but you have to use

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.599 
shot in the feeling but you have to use
it<00:02:03.810> correctly<00:02:04.109> so<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.009> mind<00:02:05.039> here

is our complete list of shots that we

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.760 
is our complete list of shots that we
try<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.289> focus<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.740> when<00:02:07.890> we're<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.069> set

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
try to focus on when we're on set

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
try to focus on when we're on set
so<00:02:10.770> let's<00:02:10.950> start<00:02:11.100> simple<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.760> easiest<00:02:12.180> shot

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so let's start simple the easiest shot

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.260 
so let's start simple the easiest shot
you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.860> your<00:02:13.980> drone<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.910> simply

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you can get with your drone is to simply

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.420 
you can get with your drone is to simply
put<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.600> up<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> air<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.350> get<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> static

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
put it up in the air and get a static

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.630 
put it up in the air and get a static
shot<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.180> motion<00:02:18.480> happening<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:20.520> can

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
shot of the motion happening you can

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.730 
shot of the motion happening you can
instantly<00:02:21.030> make<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.420> shot<00:02:21.600> cooler<00:02:21.840> by<00:02:22.350> adding

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
instantly make the shot cooler by adding

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:33.960 
instantly make the shot cooler by adding
a<00:02:22.920> simple<00:02:23.520> pan

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:49.560 

or<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.170> simple<00:02:35.620> tilt<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.070> gimbal

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.060 

the<00:02:50.570> next<00:02:50.810> up<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.050> difficulty<00:02:51.590> ladder<00:02:51.800> is

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
the next up on the difficulty ladder is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.970 
the next up on the difficulty ladder is
incorporating<00:02:53.000> more<00:02:53.150> speed<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.720> more<00:02:54.320> motion

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
incorporating more speed and more motion

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.800 
incorporating more speed and more motion
into<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> shots<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.330> first<00:02:56.570> on<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
into the shots and the first on the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.570 
into the shots and the first on the
lineup<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> simple<00:02:57.740> jib<00:02:57.950> shot<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.430> all<00:02:58.520> you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
lineup is a simple jib shot and all you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.400 
lineup is a simple jib shot and all you
have<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.760> do<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.030> raise<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.690> elevation<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
have to do is raise the elevation of the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.970 
have to do is raise the elevation of the
drone<00:03:00.650> or<00:03:00.910> bring<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> back<00:03:02.150> down<00:03:02.360> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
drone or bring it back down and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.810 
drone or bring it back down and
incorporating<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.100> foreground<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
incorporating some foreground in the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.040 
incorporating some foreground in the
shot<00:03:05.000> also<00:03:05.330> makes<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.570> really<00:03:05.720> cinematic

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
shot also makes it really cinematic

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.720 
shot also makes it really cinematic
because<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.590> gives<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.860> sense<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.370> depth

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
because it gives that sense the depth

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.000 
because it gives that sense the depth
and<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.940> illusion<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.720> there's<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.740> third

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
and the illusion of that there's a third

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.610 
and the illusion of that there's a third
dimension<00:03:13.570> next<00:03:14.570> step<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> slider<00:03:15.170> shot<00:03:15.500> you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
dimension next step is a slider shot you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.310 
dimension next step is a slider shot you
can<00:03:15.740> just<00:03:15.920> take<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.070> drone<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.580> simply<00:03:17.330> go

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
can just take the drone and simply go

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.680 
can just take the drone and simply go
pan<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.890> right<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.240> pan<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
pan to the right or you can pan to the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:30.070 
pan to the right or you can pan to the
left<00:03:26.920> lastly<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.100> pushing<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.270> pulling

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
left lastly is pushing in and pulling

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.350 
left lastly is pushing in and pulling
back<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.590> with<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.040> configuration<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:32.209> can

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
back and with this configuration you can

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360 
back and with this configuration you can
introduce<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.959> character<00:03:33.350> or<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:37.070> could<00:03:37.190> pull

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
introduce a character or you could pull

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.010 
introduce a character or you could pull
away<00:03:37.490> from<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.910> action<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.810> definitely

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
away from the action and it definitely

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.050 
away from the action and it definitely
gives<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.650> really<00:03:40.040> powerful<00:03:40.280> feeling<00:03:40.850> if<00:03:40.970> you

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
gives a really powerful feeling if you

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.120 
gives a really powerful feeling if you
do<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.300> correctly

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.800 

so<00:03:47.130> once<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.460> have<00:03:47.610> these<00:03:47.820> basics<00:03:48.330> mastered

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
so once you have these basics mastered

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.710 
so once you have these basics mastered
you<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.410> combine<00:03:49.620> two<00:03:50.190> axes<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.300> create<00:03:51.600> an

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
you can combine two axes to create an

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.360 
you can combine two axes to create an
even<00:03:51.840> more<00:03:52.170> dynamic<00:03:52.710> shots<00:03:52.950> we're<00:03:53.190> going<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
even more dynamic shots we're going to

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.230 
even more dynamic shots we're going to
tell<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.550> guys<00:03:53.610> how<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.760> do<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.060> right<00:03:54.120> now

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
tell you guys how to do that right now

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.620 
tell you guys how to do that right now
try<00:03:54.660> flying<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.140> drone<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.590> an<00:03:55.710> arc<00:03:56.630> this

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
try flying the drone in an arc this

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.110 
try flying the drone in an arc this
gives<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.960> another<00:03:58.260> third<00:03:59.010> plane<00:03:59.490> of<00:03:59.700> movement

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
gives it another third plane of movement

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.640 
gives it another third plane of movement
and<00:04:00.240> this<00:04:00.840> introduces<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.530> parallax<00:04:01.980> effect

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.320 

the<00:04:07.650> parallax<00:04:08.130> effect<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.640> same<00:04:08.820> thing

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
the parallax effect is the same thing

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.880 
the parallax effect is the same thing
you<00:04:09.480> experience<00:04:10.050> when<00:04:10.260> you're<00:04:10.410> riding<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.800> the

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
you experience when you're riding in the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.440 
you experience when you're riding in the
car<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.340> you're<00:04:11.520> looking<00:04:11.760> at<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.000> window<00:04:12.270> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
car and you're looking at the window and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.300 
car and you're looking at the window and
you<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:12.959> see<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.380> different<00:04:13.709> layers<00:04:13.890> of

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
you can see the different layers of

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.800 
you can see the different layers of
foreground<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.120> different<00:04:15.450> layers<00:04:15.660> of

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
foreground and different layers of

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.660 
foreground and different layers of
background<00:04:16.200> all<00:04:16.410> moving<00:04:16.769> simultaneously<00:04:16.920> in

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
background all moving simultaneously in

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.310 
background all moving simultaneously in
different<00:04:18.030> speeds<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.870> when<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.079> incorporate

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
different speeds so when you incorporate

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.560 
different speeds so when you incorporate
that<00:04:19.709> into<00:04:19.890> filmmaking<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.239> single

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
that into filmmaking and you can single

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.450 
that into filmmaking and you can single
out<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.720> subject<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.470> wide<00:04:22.710> landscape<00:04:23.010> shot

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
out a subject on a wide landscape shot

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.280 
out a subject on a wide landscape shot
it<00:04:23.910> really<00:04:24.210> gives<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.570> wow<00:04:24.870> factor<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
it really gives that wow factor to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.380 
it really gives that wow factor to
cinema<00:04:25.740> when<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:25.980> can<00:04:26.130> make<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.550> subject<00:04:27.090> pop

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
cinema when you can make a subject pop

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.880 
cinema when you can make a subject pop
out<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.840> screen<00:04:28.169> pretty<00:04:28.410> much<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.800> you

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
out of the screen pretty much and you

00:04:28.890 --> 00:05:32.350 
out of the screen pretty much and you
can<00:04:29.010> see<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.160> third<00:04:29.460> dimension

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.150 

so<00:05:33.360> when<00:05:33.480> you<00:05:33.540> combine<00:05:33.900> these<00:05:34.080> 3d<00:05:34.530> pans<00:05:34.800> in

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
so when you combine these 3d pans in

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.280 
so when you combine these 3d pans in
these<00:05:35.310> 3d<00:05:35.730> chip<00:05:36.000> shots<00:05:36.270> with<00:05:36.810> an<00:05:36.930> interesting

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
these 3d chip shots with an interesting

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.620 
these 3d chip shots with an interesting
subject<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.310> good<00:05:38.490> lighting<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:39.390> pretty

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
subject and good lighting you pretty

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.300 
subject and good lighting you pretty
much<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:40.050> cinema<00:05:40.440> so<00:05:40.710> don't<00:05:40.890> be<00:05:40.980> afraid<00:05:41.100> to

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
much have cinema so don't be afraid to

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.670 
much have cinema so don't be afraid to
try<00:05:41.670> new<00:05:41.700> things<00:05:41.850> to<00:05:42.510> experiment<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.440> try

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
try new things to experiment and try

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.470 
try new things to experiment and try
composing<00:05:44.250> new<00:05:44.400> shots<00:05:44.700> it's<00:05:45.240> really

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
composing new shots it's really

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.090 
composing new shots it's really
important<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.080> experiment<00:05:46.800> because<00:05:46.890> that's

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
important to experiment because that's

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.590 
important to experiment because that's
how<00:05:47.220> you<00:05:47.280> grow<00:05:47.550> as<00:05:47.760> an<00:05:47.880> artist<00:05:48.030> it's<00:05:48.360> really

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
how you grow as an artist it's really

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.080 
how you grow as an artist it's really
important<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.170> stretch<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.890> go<00:05:50.430> beyond<00:05:50.820> your

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
important to stretch and go beyond your

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.060 
important to stretch and go beyond your
normal<00:05:51.300> ways<00:05:51.600> of<00:05:51.780> thinking<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.200> having<00:05:52.890> a

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
normal ways of thinking and having a

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.770 
normal ways of thinking and having a
camera<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.460> can<00:05:53.670> be<00:05:53.850> anywhere<00:05:54.300> really<00:05:54.600> it

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
camera that can be anywhere really it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.480 
camera that can be anywhere really it
really<00:05:54.810> allows<00:05:55.290> that<00:05:55.500> a<00:05:55.740> great<00:05:55.980> example<00:05:56.250> of

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
really allows that a great example of

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.620 
really allows that a great example of
getting<00:05:56.760> creative<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.210> pointing<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.600> camera

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
getting creative is pointing the camera

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.050 
getting creative is pointing the camera
straight<00:05:58.110> down<00:05:58.350> and<00:05:58.590> getting<00:05:59.250> patterns<00:05:59.820> in

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
straight down and getting patterns in

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.280 
straight down and getting patterns in
the<00:06:00.090> ground<00:06:00.390> or<00:06:00.720> whether<00:06:00.870> you're<00:06:00.990> filming

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
the ground or whether you're filming

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.880 
the ground or whether you're filming
roads<00:06:02.160> or<00:06:02.610> beautiful<00:06:03.210> gardens<00:06:03.570> it's<00:06:04.560> really

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
roads or beautiful gardens it's really

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.680 
roads or beautiful gardens it's really
cool<00:06:05.010> characteristic<00:06:05.610> shots<00:06:05.790> this<00:06:05.970> way<00:06:06.120> so

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
cool characteristic shots this way so

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.450 
cool characteristic shots this way so
another<00:06:07.050> thing<00:06:07.140> we<00:06:07.380> recommend<00:06:07.830> is<00:06:08.040> now<00:06:08.250> that

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
another thing we recommend is now that

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.040 
another thing we recommend is now that

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
to focus on the aerial shots and kind of

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.360 
to focus on the aerial shots and kind of
imagine<00:06:12.810> behind<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.740> scenes<00:06:13.980> and<00:06:14.160> how<00:06:14.310> the
