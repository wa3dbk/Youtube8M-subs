goalkeeper this game is absolutely

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
for that phrase right there I think that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.560 
for that phrase right there I think that
lawyer<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.590> awful<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.360> made

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
lawyer is so awful I think that he made

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
lawyer is so awful I think that he made
some<00:01:42.780> spectacular<00:01:42.990> saves<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.009> I'll<00:01:44.070> give<00:01:44.220> him

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
some spectacular saves and I'll give him

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
some spectacular saves and I'll give him
that<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.939> his<00:01:45.060> inconsistency<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:46.290> he

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that but it's his inconsistency that he

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.550 
that but it's his inconsistency that he
drove<00:01:47.250> me<00:01:47.280> absolutely<00:01:47.670> crazy<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:49.229> not

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
drove me absolutely crazy I do not

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.540 
drove me absolutely crazy I do not
believe<00:01:49.770> he's<00:01:50.130> worth<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.520> hundred<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.000> seventy

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
believe he's worth a hundred and seventy

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.340 
believe he's worth a hundred and seventy
right<00:01:51.760> now<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:52.180> think<00:01:52.720> that's<00:01:52.870> absolute

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
right now I think that's absolute

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.230 
right now I think that's absolute
 I<00:01:53.920> would<00:01:54.070> put<00:01:54.250> him<00:01:54.340> out<00:01:54.460> around<00:01:54.760> 30

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
 I would put him out around 30

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.360 
 I would put him out around 30
to<00:01:55.480> 40<00:01:55.810> k<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.260> think<00:01:56.710> he<00:01:56.830> can<00:01:56.950> make<00:01:57.130> some

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
to 40 k I think he can make some

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.090 
to 40 k I think he can make some
seriously<00:01:58.120> amazing<00:01:58.570> saves<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.470> his<00:01:59.710> reflexes

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
seriously amazing saves and his reflexes

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.770 
seriously amazing saves and his reflexes
I'll<00:02:00.490> give<00:02:00.640> him<00:02:00.820> his<00:02:00.970> reflexes<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.660> his

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
I'll give him his reflexes and his

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.110 
I'll give him his reflexes and his
handling<00:02:02.140> are<00:02:02.290> absolutely<00:02:02.890> amazing<00:02:03.010> I'll<00:02:03.910> say

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
handling are absolutely amazing I'll say

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.370 
handling are absolutely amazing I'll say
that<00:02:04.270> his<00:02:04.360> handling<00:02:04.690> is<00:02:04.840> probably<00:02:05.110> one<00:02:05.230> of<00:02:05.260> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
that his handling is probably one of the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.530 
that his handling is probably one of the
best<00:02:05.530> I've<00:02:05.740> seen<00:02:05.770> in<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.190> game<00:02:06.400> but<00:02:07.390> its

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
best I've seen in the game but its

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.359 
best I've seen in the game but its
positioning<00:02:08.110> when<00:02:08.590> he<00:02:08.650> comes<00:02:08.860> out<00:02:08.980> of<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.160> box

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
positioning when he comes out of the box

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.480 
positioning when he comes out of the box
is<00:02:10.240> diving<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:11.650> his<00:02:11.920> lack<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.160> effort

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
is diving it's just his lack of effort

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.940 
is diving it's just his lack of effort
just<00:02:12.850> really<00:02:13.540> drives<00:02:14.050> his<00:02:14.290> card<00:02:14.530> into<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
just really drives his card into the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.220 
just really drives his card into the
ground<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.820> really<00:02:16.330> was<00:02:16.480> disappointed<00:02:17.140> in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
ground and I really was disappointed in

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.200 
ground and I really was disappointed in
him<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.710> still<00:02:18.220> think<00:02:18.460> he's<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.790> best<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.090> them

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
him I still think he's the best of them

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.660 
him I still think he's the best of them
going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.510> Slater<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.020> saying<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:20.980> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
going to Slater and saying that that

going to Slater and saying that that
being<00:02:21.910> said<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.240> think<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.660> Bundesliga

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
being said I think that the Bundesliga

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.160 
being said I think that the Bundesliga
this<00:02:23.380> year<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.920> lacks<00:02:24.630> overall<00:02:25.630> skill<00:02:25.960> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
