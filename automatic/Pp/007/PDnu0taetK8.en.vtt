00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hey people what was there at the start and today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.589
 I have two very special things 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.219
 I say to the box to open for 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.349
 you guys I have 26 2 booster of the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.690
 gamers stars these are such little ones 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.320
 So football figures 2014 season 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 15 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.410
 they are just such little figures 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.449
 they were not called in former times 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 Zuckerstrasse namely the micro flow 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 I already have stars and I have 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.029
 collected I have about 15 here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.369
 to stand around 20 such figures 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.349
 if you like the old microsoft that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.120
 I want to see characters write me 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.320
 I would comment myself 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.899
 In any case there is interest 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.239
 their 32 players you can draw 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.129
 oh from fc bavaria munich 8 from the bvb 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 get some other players 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.550
 from real madrid in their ronaldo or 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.559
 wayne for example from barcelona from asl 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 from chelsea of ​​paris and still contain 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 a few special characters at once 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 two of them that only one baggage 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.420
 costs 299 so a figure and then have 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.760
 I can give you two old figures 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.760
 from the micro star already show the have 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.010
 I stop here still entitled once frank 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.600
 lampard see you look like that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 really nice hammer from my opinion 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.210
 after frank lampard and on the right 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770
 page here ronaldinho from fc barcelona 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.229
 and animal frank lampard is just off 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.259
 England in national jersey so I think 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.939
 the figure really looks applause once 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 if you all a micro stars 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.270
 want to see characters as I said writes 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.369
 in the comments I have already 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 In any case, we will do that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 soccer starts sometimes look which 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 figure we have in it or which one 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.100
 we'll do both characters in here 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.820
 We also want to get the figure out and one 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.740
 note as we have thomas müller vom fc 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.909
 bavaria munich very much there is my love 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.100
 friends thomas müller 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.360
 okay that's new here now 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.220
 no longer worth such it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.100
 but is just just gamers stars 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.399
 on it has the logo of the series 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.829
 thomas müller l see the figures like that 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.159
 in my opinion again really hot 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.489
 on students on b10 it says also 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.720
 rearranged b10 thomas müller can 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.730
 you argue now if he really does 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.030
 looks like thomas müller but a few 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.380
 face 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.090
 agree on such a, I would say 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.610
 thomas miller really knows again 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.020
 my favorite player from germany 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.510
 my favorite player thomas müller 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.370
 I can point that out 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.860
 my series it trashes again on mine 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 this channel pack trader became the series 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.819
 it ended up trashing again 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.310
 every case thomas müller pulled here 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.610
 as the first figure we travel properly 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.790
 a few more notes in it had one 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.010
 between 14.15 and everyone has one 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.410
 here are all the figures you see 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.450
 can pull 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.160
 that was it here so the note can be 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 I guess I'll do it on that , too 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.269
 I'll pick myself up on my stomach 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.850
 the second pack is still on the second 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.880
 booster pack or poster that tells me 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.500
 that you would say I honor pack 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.500
 Let's open it and there we go 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.220
 still the note and there we pull one 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.769
 from the bvb namely henrik mkhitaryan ice 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.810
 very nice matin friends with guitars 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.280
 So two I say my Bundesliga 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.650
 player in it was thomas müller vom fc 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.430
 bavaria munich and henrik with italy 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.140
 from the bvb 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:29.959
 and that is number 5 here 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.970
 and thomas müller was ok b10 every time 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.200
 I think the characters are really nice 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.850
 I also order easily from it 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.680
 display writes as I said in the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.630
 You have to comment today 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.280
 I'll write many comments 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.780
 because I want to know if you like the old ones 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.720
 see micro stars because I can 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.970
 compare again here show left 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.140
 micro stars and right pokerstars on 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.519
 a look actually not at all 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.230
 I think it must be down here 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.540
 the lower part is just at the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.269
 superstars evergreen and at the micro 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.530
 stars are always different 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.299
 every case writes in 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.370
 Comment if you like the old micro star 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.620
 want to see my collection and if I want 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.070
 Get more from the superstars 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.530
 should 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.850
 I think I'm going private 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.269
 to get more and each more 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.640
 hold 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.989
 yes, I'll say something like that 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.579
 so that you see yourself 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.260
 So how do you say the glass carton 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.090
 Close no idea how it can be up 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.500
 In any case, I will make you friendly 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.599
 Keep it because I get the figures right 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.900
 I think thank you in any case 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.740
 a lot to look skin purely people change 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.740
 the risk
