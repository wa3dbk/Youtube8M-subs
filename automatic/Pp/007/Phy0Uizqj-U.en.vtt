00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
counteract them directly over time is a

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.720 
counteract them directly over time is a
color<00:02:52.320> depositing<00:02:52.890> conditioning<00:02:53.370> system

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
color depositing conditioning system

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.580 
color depositing conditioning system
it's<00:02:54.030> damage<00:02:54.630> free<00:02:54.870> which<00:02:55.140> means<00:02:55.350> that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it's damage free which means that

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.320 
it's damage free which means that
there's<00:02:55.800> no<00:02:56.010> lifting<00:02:56.520> or<00:02:56.640> anything<00:02:56.850> going<00:02:57.090> on
