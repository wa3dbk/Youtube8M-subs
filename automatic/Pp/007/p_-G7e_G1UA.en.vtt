you go to accessibility and go down

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
you go to accessibility and go down
there's<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> new<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:55.920> called<00:01:55.979> increased

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and you know you know just increases the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.840 
and you know you know just increases the
contrast<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> bottom

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
contrast so if you can see on the bottom

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.700 
contrast so if you can see on the bottom
of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:04.610> home<00:02:05.610> button<00:02:05.909> home<00:02:06.659> screen<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.560> can

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
of the home button home screen if I can

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.619 
of the home button home screen if I can
actually<00:02:08.069> cut<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
actually cut it

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.140 
actually cut it
okay<00:02:10.629> now<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.470> right<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.650> now<00:02:12.040> if<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.430> go<00:02:13.000> home

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
okay now all right so now if you go home

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.710 
okay now all right so now if you go home
and<00:02:13.750> go<00:02:14.349> down<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.010> see<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.970> black<00:02:16.239> typical

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and go down and see this black typical

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.809 
and go down and see this black typical
text<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.290> it's<00:02:17.470> much<00:02:17.800> darker<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
text and it's much darker in the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.210 
text and it's much darker in the
background<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.720> minor<00:02:20.230> changes<00:02:20.590> safe<00:02:20.769> even

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
background so minor changes safe even

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.100 
background so minor changes safe even
when<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.849> go<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.150> white<00:02:22.390> background<00:02:23.080> like

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
when you go to a white background like

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.680 
when you go to a white background like
the<00:02:23.290> App<00:02:23.410> Store<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:24.459> them<00:02:24.730> much<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.629> a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the App Store not them much of a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.789 
the App Store not them much of a
difference<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.110> don't<00:02:26.260> know<00:02:26.349> if<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:26.680> will

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
difference I don't know if this will

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.640 
difference I don't know if this will
preserve<00:02:27.040> battery<00:02:27.280> life<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.810> don't<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
preserve battery life but I don't know I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.490 
preserve battery life but I don't know I
I<00:02:30.129> wonder<00:02:31.769> then<00:02:33.599> here<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> pretty<00:02:35.379> cool

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
I wonder then here is a pretty cool

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.680 
I wonder then here is a pretty cool
thing<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.310> main<00:02:36.459> thing<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.569> know

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
thing not the main thing is you know

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.680 
thing not the main thing is you know
smoother<00:02:38.410> faster<00:02:38.650> animations<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.480> lot<00:02:40.599> of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
smoother faster animations and a lot of

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.670 
smoother faster animations and a lot of
people<00:02:40.870> have<00:02:40.959> been<00:02:41.049> complaining<00:02:41.200> about<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
people have been complaining about the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.729 
people have been complaining about the
iOS<00:02:42.040> 7<00:02:42.160> animations<00:02:42.700> are<00:02:42.819> being<00:02:43.000> fast<00:02:43.239> now<00:02:43.930> it's

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
iOS 7 animations are being fast now it's

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.860 
iOS 7 animations are being fast now it's
much<00:02:45.099> much<00:02:45.730> more<00:02:45.790> faster<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.660> see

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
much much more faster so you can see

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.250 
much much more faster so you can see
here<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.849> it's<00:02:48.849> a<00:02:48.940> cool<00:02:49.239> animation<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.110> it's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
here and it's a cool animation but it's

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.620 
here and it's a cool animation but it's
in<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.220> past<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.730> been<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.090> slow<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:52.510> now

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
in the past it's been so slow but now

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.900 
in the past it's been so slow but now
it's<00:02:52.780> much<00:02:52.959> faster<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.519> jailbreak

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
it's much faster just like the jailbreak

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.050 
it's much faster just like the jailbreak
I<00:02:55.090> saw<00:02:55.269> in<00:02:56.230> another<00:02:56.319> video<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.069> if<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.610> ends

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
I saw in another video and if it ends

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.780 
I saw in another video and if it ends
still<00:02:58.329> if<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.379> unlock<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.129> and<00:03:00.160> go<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
still if you unlock it and go to the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.890 
still if you unlock it and go to the
home<00:03:00.910> screen<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.269> cannot

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
home screen you cannot

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.860 
home screen you cannot
Nino's<00:03:02.260> swipe<00:03:03.190> automatically<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.569> have<00:03:04.599> to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
Nino's swipe automatically you have to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.780 
Nino's swipe automatically you have to
wait<00:03:05.049> at<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.349> think<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.680> half<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.920> second<00:03:06.250> which<00:03:06.760> is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
wait at I think a half a second which is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.210 
wait at I think a half a second which is
not<00:03:07.180> good<00:03:07.480> at<00:03:07.569> all<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.410> Apple<00:03:08.650> should<00:03:09.010> fix

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
not good at all but Apple should fix

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.610 
not good at all but Apple should fix
that<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.489> iOS<00:03:09.730> 8<00:03:09.970> but<00:03:10.450> still<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.319> pretty

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that in iOS 8 but still it's a pretty

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.129 
that in iOS 8 but still it's a pretty
cool<00:03:11.799> update<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.280> uh<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.690> didn't<00:03:13.690> very<00:03:13.959> smooth
