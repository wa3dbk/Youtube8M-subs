 hello friends of the forum I will look for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:15.139
 Huawei 730 today I come with the tutorial 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:18.030
 of what I promised them from the official rom 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.710
 105 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.890
 for Huawei 730 to eliminate the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.710
 Personalization of the orinokia cookies 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.490
 30 that we all have and is known for 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 for having that and besides that heavy what 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.340
 I went up to mega for the reason that the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.880
 huawei server takes a long time 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.160
 download the files so I expect from 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.920
 true that they can enjoy it to the fullest 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 and good let's start 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 a little bit with this 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.730
 here I have the file has already 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.470
 decompressed as you can see it has 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.470
 three folders which 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.720
 a part of all we have our 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.630
 flash tool 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.310
 will organize that a pettitte to whom there are 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.870
 what to pay to work with our 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.060
 solar and other telephones such as 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.820
 lenovo phones 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.450
 in the software part we have two 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.130
 folders in the sd of day ' folder 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.899
 that is where our files are 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.350
 to update by re the sd card 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.439
 but not in our case and the other that the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.939
 usebeq serious that the one that has all the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.619
 files needed to work with the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.140
 flash tool so good 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.610
 let's start with the phone work 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.159
 I'm going to use my phone because without 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.679
 want to make a small mistake and good 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.009
 let's take it as an excuse 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.400
 perfect ok let's work with flash 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.600
 tool 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.350
 let's select our rom 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.840
 how to place it in the place where the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.380
 file I have it in the folder of the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 who 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.830
 and we locate by sergey and look for the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.480
 very important notepad file 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.190
 this 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.670
 and you have to tell the first two 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.170
 options 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.489
 the truth that I made the mistake of 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.099
 take it off and let me call read me see 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.410
 which causes me error in the camera 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.500
 we go 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.200
 to distill the also so that 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.780
 have no error and the village of 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.820
 the steel we give so that we do not have 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 error when working with the flash tool ok 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.790
 let's minimize a moment this 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.790
 window 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.130
 and now that I was a bit hung 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.140
 to another thing I skills and do not give him 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.390
 to form because form would erase 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.460
 absolutely everything we have inside 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.240
 of the phone and you could not recover that 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.580
 had as block ok important this that 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.060
 I will stress them when it comes to connecting 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.460
 the phone we must have it off and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.720
 with the battery removed commented a 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.440
 moment the administrator of 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.460
 device 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.400
 because it is important that you know this 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.920
 look, you do not have if you do not have the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.520
 installed drivers the famous pre 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.520
 loader 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.180
 we go 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.810
 to give a side doctor is not going to say 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.440
 this configuration we say yes 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.230
 we are a moment 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:11.150
 and look, I already have installed after 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.150
 with which they will be able to see them here 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.950
 there comes a moment 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:26.289
 here we have hope to see 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.159
 it is very important that you see it since 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:32.469
 this driver is going to ask for a 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:35.860
 Once they connect the phone with the cell phone 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:38.409
 off but these should update it 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.969
 the fastest possible as it is 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.969
 disconnect and lose the port 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.979
 they look for the driver in the folder 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.229
 where where discounting the 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.240
 controllers and ready if you have doubts 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.639
 I asked the question 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.810
 once we connect the phone in the 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.030
 flash tool down to the right 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.550
 we will find what it tells us 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.689
 mediatek loader 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.539
 a little thing is very fundamental 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.979
 this tractor process lasts a lot like this 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.979
 I'm going to bet the moment 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.190
 we have finished the process 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.050
 we see a little circle so see him 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.930
 how are you telling us that we're done 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.530
 The procedure 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.060
 we disconnect the usb cable and turn on 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.160
 the phone normally 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.320
 the start lasts approximately 1 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.180
 5 or 10 minutes because take a little 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.910
 less but it starts 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.789
 I hope it has served you well and that 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.150
 the technician remains and it will be until the 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.150
 next
