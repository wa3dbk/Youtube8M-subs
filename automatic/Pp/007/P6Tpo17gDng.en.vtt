00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
get up to a hundred pounds and it's so

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.650 
get up to a hundred pounds and it's so
big<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.240> actually<00:00:13.400> it<00:00:14.400> stems<00:00:14.759> off<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.420> trunk

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

of<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> tree<00:00:15.900> not<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> from<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> tree

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
of the tree not the from the tree

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.240 
of the tree not the from the tree
branches<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.330> how<00:00:18.449> big<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.250> because

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
branches that's how big it is because

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.060 
branches that's how big it is because
it's<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.490> massive<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> weigh<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.660> much

definitely saw Asia Thailand is where
they<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:44.430> probably<00:00:44.640> import<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.360> jackfruit

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
they they probably import the jackfruit

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810
