00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the new max link apps so check it out

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
the new max link apps so check it out
right<00:00:17.789> oh<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.119> by<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.270> way<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.720> doing<00:00:18.930> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
right oh and by the way I'm doing it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.740 
right oh and by the way I'm doing it
rican<00:00:19.470> style<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.939> things<00:00:21.240> not

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
rican style right so these things not

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.689 
rican style right so these things not
complicated<00:00:22.470> if<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.769> dumbass<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
complicated if my dumbass can do it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.509 
complicated if my dumbass can do it
believe<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
believe me I know that you can do it so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.000 
believe me I know that you can do it so
if<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.140> about<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.470> you've

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
if you really think about it you've

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
if you really think about it you've

and you know that you're going to need a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.760 
and you know that you're going to need a
max<00:00:43.050> link<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.570> cap<00:00:45.960> simple<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
max link at so see a cap simple to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.310 
max link at so see a cap simple to
understand<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.820> imagine<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.420> little

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
understand just imagine this little

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
understand just imagine this little
storage<00:00:49.620> device<00:00:50.100> sort<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.420> car

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
storage device sort of like your car

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
storage device sort of like your car
battery<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> needs<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.430> little

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
battery right so it needs that little

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.689 
battery right so it needs that little
quick<00:00:54.000> charge<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:55.100> better<00:00:56.100> put<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
quick charge or better put a little

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.510 
quick charge or better put a little
quick<00:00:57.030> discharge<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.780> power<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.920> man<00:00:59.129> when

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
quick discharge of power on the man when

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
quick discharge of power on the man when
you're<00:00:59.609> hitting<00:00:59.789> those<00:00:59.940> low<00:01:00.210> notes<00:01:00.510> you're

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you're hitting those low notes you're

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349 
you're hitting those low notes you're
going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> need<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.559> little<00:01:01.739> extra<00:01:01.920> bump<00:01:02.370> max

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
going to need that little extra bump max

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.479 
going to need that little extra bump max
link<00:01:03.629> caps<00:01:03.870> definitely<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
link caps definitely going to do this so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
link caps definitely going to do this so
the<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> choose<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> cab<00:01:06.750> depends<00:01:07.320> on

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the way that you choose a cab depends on

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.620 
the way that you choose a cab depends on
the<00:01:07.770> amplifier<00:01:08.460> power<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.180> one

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the amplifier power that you have one

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
the amplifier power that you have one
amp<00:01:09.869> two<00:01:10.080> amps<00:01:10.409> doesn't<00:01:11.070> matter<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.549> all

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
amp two amps doesn't matter it's all

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
amp two amps doesn't matter it's all
about<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> power<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.200> caps<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.860> rated<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
about the power so caps are rated in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.410 
about the power so caps are rated in
ferrets<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.330> ferret<00:01:15.810> 1000<00:01:16.770> watts<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.280> max

link we made it easy we got several
choices<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> guys<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.560> think

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
choices for you guys so if you think

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.730 
choices for you guys so if you think
about<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.460> amplifiers<00:01:24.530> anywhere<00:01:25.530> from

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
about it all amplifiers anywhere from

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
about it all amplifiers anywhere from
zero<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.369> 1500<00:01:27.240> watts<00:01:27.479> you're<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
zero to 1500 watts you're going to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.219 
zero to 1500 watts you're going to
