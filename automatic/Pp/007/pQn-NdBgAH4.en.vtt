the<00:00:28.619> tuning<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> new

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the tuning down this is a new

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590 
the tuning down this is a new
arrangement<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.360> originally<00:00:33.360> played

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
arrangement for me I originally played

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440 
arrangement for me I originally played
the<00:00:33.750> song<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.440> e<00:00:34.649> type<00:00:34.920> tuning<00:00:35.460> where<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> had

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the song in an e type tuning where I had

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.860 
the song in an e type tuning where I had
to<00:00:36.570> tune<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.870> couple<00:00:37.170> strings<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:38.660> but<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to tune a couple strings up but it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.049 
to tune a couple strings up but it's
actually<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.559> manageable<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.730> play

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
actually much more manageable to play

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
actually much more manageable to play
the<00:00:42.239> song<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.750> open<00:00:43.290> D<00:00:43.440> tuning<00:00:43.469> where<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.430> just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the song in open D tuning where you just

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.569 
the song in open D tuning where you just
have<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> tune<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.300> few<00:00:45.510> strings<00:00:45.989> down<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have to tune a few strings down and you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.860 
have to tune a few strings down and you
don't<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> worry<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.360> tuning

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
don't have to worry about tuning

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.220 
don't have to worry about tuning
anything<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> potentially<00:00:50.219> breaking<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
anything up and potentially breaking a

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.580 
anything up and potentially breaking a
string<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.160> playing<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.789> open<00:00:54.059> D<00:00:54.410> will<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.440> D

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
string so playing it an open D will be D

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.660 
string so playing it an open D will be D
a<00:00:58.670> D<00:00:59.750> F<00:01:00.770> sharp<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.420 

so<00:01:06.540> you'll<00:01:06.750> tune<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> low<00:01:07.350> E<00:01:07.560> string<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:08.190> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so you'll tune the low E string down to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.149 
so you'll tune the low E string down to
a<00:01:08.460> D<00:01:08.729> they'll<00:01:09.479> tune<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.870> G<00:01:10.140> down<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:10.950> F

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
a D they'll tune the G down to an F

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.320 
a D they'll tune the G down to an F
sharp<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.630> B<00:01:12.990> down<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.860> A<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> tune<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
sharp to the B down to an A and tune the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.290 
sharp to the B down to an A and tune the
high<00:01:15.720> E<00:01:15.750> down<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> D<00:01:18.530> sound<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:20.150> sound<00:01:21.150> like

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
high E down to a D sound like sound like

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.420 
high E down to a D sound like sound like
this<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.410> letting<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.950> trans<00:01:23.220> ring

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
this if you are letting this trans ring

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.080 
this if you are letting this trans ring
open

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.239 

then<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.719> get<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> original<00:01:31.319> key<00:01:31.770> which<00:01:32.039> is

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
then to get to the original key which is

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.740 
then to get to the original key which is
um<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.819> guess<00:01:33.359> like<00:01:33.569> II<00:01:33.829> you'll<00:01:34.829> put<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.569> capo<00:01:36.569> on

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
um I guess like II you'll put a capo on

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380 
um I guess like II you'll put a capo on

same<00:02:25.410> shape<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.040> slide<00:02:26.820> up<00:02:27.060> two<00:02:27.450> frets<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
same shape you just slide up two frets a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.830 
same shape you just slide up two frets a
one<00:02:28.440> full<00:02:28.680> step<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.160> will<00:02:30.150> sound<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.210 

so<00:02:36.840> hammer<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.410> hammer<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.480> slide<00:02:40.100> slide<00:02:41.100> down

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so hammer on hammer on slide slide down

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.120 
so hammer on hammer on slide slide down
then<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.370> complete<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.940> intro<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:46.010> played<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
then to complete the intro I played the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.380 
then to complete the intro I played the
strings<00:02:47.400> open<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.650> do<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.799> hammer<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.390> 2nd

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
strings open and do a hammer on 2nd

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.699 
strings open and do a hammer on 2nd
string<00:02:51.660> 2nd<00:02:52.470> fret<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.540> complete<00:02:54.900> intro<00:02:55.380> or

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
string 2nd fret so the complete intro or

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:15.199 
string 2nd fret so the complete intro or
riff<00:02:56.070> sounds<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.489> this

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.860 

and<00:03:16.530> then<00:03:17.530> getting<00:03:17.890> into<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.189> vs.<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.510> just

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and then getting into the vs. you just

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.430 
and then getting into the vs. you just
will<00:03:20.079> start<00:03:20.319> with<00:03:20.469> the<00:03:20.560> same<00:03:20.799> shape

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
will start with the same shape

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.560 
will start with the same shape
and<00:03:22.920> then<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.070> play<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.460> variation<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.360> the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
and then I play a variation on the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.770 
and then I play a variation on the
second<00:03:24.960> chord<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.980> play<00:03:26.220> play<00:03:27.210> it<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:27.540> my

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
second chord I just play play it with my

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.500 
second chord I just play play it with my
ring<00:03:28.440> finger<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.460> second<00:03:29.910> string<00:03:29.940> fourth

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
ring finger on the second string fourth

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.080 
ring finger on the second string fourth
fret<00:03:32.960> so<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.200> first<00:03:34.440> verse<00:03:34.650> will<00:03:34.920> go<00:03:35.100> first

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
fret so the first verse will go first

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.200 
fret so the first verse will go first
time<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> ran<00:03:36.810> away<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:38.780> saw<00:03:41.120> faces<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.300> trees<00:03:42.630> I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
time I ran away I saw faces on trees I

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:54.650 
time I ran away I saw faces on trees I
heard<00:03:45.650> voices<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.190> storm<00:03:52.820> then<00:03:53.820> for<00:03:54.210> the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
heard voices in the storm then for the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.910 
heard voices in the storm then for the
blue<00:03:55.080> part<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:56.030> just<00:03:57.030> keep<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.450> very<00:03:58.410> board

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
blue part I just keep that very board

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.750 
blue part I just keep that very board
right<00:03:59.220> here

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
right here

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:19.350 
right here
and<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:00.660> go<00:04:00.840> back<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.290> original<00:04:01.380> chord

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.270 

all<00:04:20.360> the<00:04:20.570> verses<00:04:20.990> have<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.500> structure<00:04:22.040> and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
all the verses have that structure and

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.750 
all the verses have that structure and
then<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.300> different<00:04:23.840> part<00:04:24.050> would<00:04:24.260> be<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
then the different part would be the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.260 
then the different part would be the
bridge<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.750> bridge<00:04:26.780> starts<00:04:27.530> with<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.910> shape

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
bridge the bridge starts with that shape

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.480 
bridge the bridge starts with that shape
that's<00:04:29.570> two<00:04:29.870> friends<00:04:30.290> not<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.800> one<00:04:30.980> full<00:04:31.220> step

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
that's two friends not so one full step

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.220 
that's two friends not so one full step
up<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.860> way<00:04:37.040> they<00:04:37.220> look<00:04:37.460> at<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:38.840> if<00:04:39.080> you

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
up the way they look at you is if you

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.560 
up the way they look at you is if you
were<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.440> stranger

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:05:01.230 

when<00:04:46.570> they<00:04:46.750> talk<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:59.070> then<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.310> conclude

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
when they talk to you then I conclude

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.440 
when they talk to you then I conclude
the<00:05:01.420> song<00:05:01.660> just<00:05:01.960> playing<00:05:02.260> that<00:05:02.470> riff<00:05:03.450> that's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
the song just playing that riff that's

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.420 
the song just playing that riff that's
pretty<00:05:04.750> much<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:05.110> centers<00:05:05.590> on<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.980> one<00:05:06.160> chord

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
pretty much it centers on that one chord

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.790 
pretty much it centers on that one chord
shape<00:05:06.700> like<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.150> said<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.200> just<00:05:08.410> move<00:05:08.650> it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
shape like I said and you just move it

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.570 
shape like I said and you just move it
up<00:05:08.950> a<00:05:09.100> couple<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.430> threads<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.770> hammer<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.160> is

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
up a couple of threads the hammer on is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.540 
up a couple of threads the hammer on is
a<00:05:12.640> nice<00:05:12.880> detail<00:05:13.150> that's<00:05:13.600> 2nd<00:05:14.200> fret<00:05:14.520> 2nd<00:05:15.520> string

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
that he feeds throughout the song and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.760 
that he feeds throughout the song and
that's<00:05:19.300> pretty<00:05:19.630> much<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.200> getting<00:05:20.650> down

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
that's pretty much it so getting down

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.120 
that's pretty much it so getting down

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
throughout the song and that's pretty

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.150
