00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
thing sony has left out so far is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.630 
thing sony has left out so far is
exactly<00:00:44.969> how<00:00:45.120> much<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> cost

exactly how much is this going to cost

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.220

based<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.850> their<00:00:48.030> ambition<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
based on their ambition which as you

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.580 
based on their ambition which as you
said<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.649> kind<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> cord<00:00:50.340> cutting<00:00:50.899> idea<00:00:51.899> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
said is kind of a cord cutting idea it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
said is kind of a cord cutting idea it's
probably<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.430> more<00:00:53.760> comparable<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
probably going to be more comparable to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
but a lot of that is sort of moving in

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
but a lot of that is sort of moving in
that<00:01:53.850> direction<00:01:54.409> anyway<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.799> space<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that direction anyway in this space a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
that direction anyway in this space a
lot<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.670> those<00:01:56.790> features<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.600> haven't<00:01:58.229> seen

package their costs and what their x
factor<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.370> terms<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.670> why<00:02:26.850> would<00:02:27.000> i<00:02:27.060> get<00:02:27.120> a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
factor is in terms of why would i get a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.380 
factor is in terms of why would i get a
playstation<00:02:27.510> 4<00:02:28.200> or<00:02:28.530> 3<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.090> rather

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
playstation 4 or 3 and do this rather

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660 
playstation 4 or 3 and do this rather
than<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.780> paying<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.290> cable<00:02:31.740> company<00:02:31.770> and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
than just paying my cable company and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.980 
than just paying my cable company and
now<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.240> mention<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:33.840> are

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
now you just mention that there are

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.630 
now you just mention that there are
certain<00:02:34.320> missing<00:02:34.770> links<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.160> their<00:02:35.310> service

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
certain missing links in their service

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.490 
certain missing links in their service
right<00:02:35.790> now<00:02:35.820> for<00:02:36.060> example<00:02:36.120> time<00:02:36.570> warner<00:02:36.960> ESPN

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
right now for example time warner ESPN

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.940 
right now for example time warner ESPN
ABC<00:02:37.980> missing<00:02:38.850> right<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.930> what<00:02:40.530> offerings

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
ABC missing right now but what offerings

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.980 
ABC missing right now but what offerings
would<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.400> game<00:02:41.670> over<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.000> legacy<00:02:42.450> providers

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
would be game over for legacy providers

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.650 
would be game over for legacy providers
I<00:02:43.230> think<00:02:43.710> Sports<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> big<00:02:44.760> deal<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.330> they<00:02:45.480> can

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
I think Sports is a big deal if they can

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.860 
I think Sports is a big deal if they can
secure<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.460> very<00:02:47.460> comprehensive<00:02:48.030> sports

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
secure a very comprehensive sports

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.610 
secure a very comprehensive sports
package<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:50.660> over-the-top<00:02:51.660> service<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.500> one

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
package for over-the-top service for one

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010 
package for over-the-top service for one
of<00:02:52.740> these<00:02:52.800> oh<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.490> getting<00:02:53.720> TV<00:02:54.720> over<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.570 
of these oh you know getting TV over the
Internet<00:02:55.350> services<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.950> would<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> big

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
Internet services that would be a big

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.880 
Internet services that would be a big
game<00:02:56.820> changer<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:58.110> know<00:02:58.350> I'm<00:02:58.530> sure<00:02:58.560> they're

hold all the keys to these kind of

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.790 
hold all the keys to these kind of
things<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.790> saw<00:03:06.470> previously<00:03:07.470> with

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
things and you saw previously with

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.440 
things and you saw previously with
Intel's<00:03:08.250> service<00:03:08.670> when<00:03:08.820> they<00:03:08.910> tried<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.180> do

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
Intel's service when they tried to do

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.150 
Intel's service when they tried to do
something<00:03:09.660> similar<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.560> was<00:03:10.920> completely

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
something similar that was completely

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160 
something similar that was completely
gutted<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:12.270> they<00:03:12.600> couldn't<00:03:12.840> work<00:03:13.050> out

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
gutted because they couldn't work out

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.720 
gutted because they couldn't work out
these<00:03:13.410> content<00:03:13.830> deals<00:03:13.980> because<00:03:14.190> when<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.520> do

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
these content deals because when you do

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.570 
these content deals because when you do
work<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.090> out<00:03:15.410> generally<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.860> cost<00:03:17.100> tends<00:03:17.490> to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
work is out generally the cost tends to

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.010 
work is out generally the cost tends to
be<00:03:17.700> about<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.120> same<00:03:18.270> as<00:03:18.420> cable<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:18.900> then

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
be about the same as cable so then

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.900 
be about the same as cable so then
you're<00:03:19.140> like<00:03:19.260> well<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.340> paying<00:03:20.760> the
