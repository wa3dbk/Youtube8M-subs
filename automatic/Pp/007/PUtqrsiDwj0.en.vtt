the concept images that you can find out
there<00:00:57.399> it<00:00:57.610> shows<00:00:58.180> a<00:00:58.210> creativity<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:59.200> some

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
there it shows a creativity that some

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.950

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
people have regardless of how crazy or

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.160 
people have regardless of how crazy or
out<00:01:02.440> there<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.100> idea<00:01:03.520> might<00:01:03.790> seem<00:01:04.170> even

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
out there the idea might seem even

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.290 
out there the idea might seem even
though<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.590> might<00:01:05.800> not<00:01:05.950> be<00:01:06.009> possible<00:01:06.310> now<00:01:06.610> it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
though it might not be possible now it

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.540 
though it might not be possible now it
sure<00:01:07.600> can<00:01:07.840> fuel<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.200> ideas<00:01:08.680> for<00:01:08.860> devices<00:01:09.369> in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
sure can fuel the ideas for devices in

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.969 
sure can fuel the ideas for devices in
the<00:01:09.640> future<00:01:10.000> now<00:01:10.990> i<00:01:11.020> think<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.380> key<00:01:11.619> thing<00:01:11.649> is

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
the future now i think the key thing is

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.830 
the future now i think the key thing is
that<00:01:12.369> there<00:01:12.550> needs<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.910> be<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.060> separation

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
that there needs to be a separation

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.279 
that there needs to be a separation
between<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.380> wants<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.550> needs<00:01:15.789> so<00:01:16.720> what

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
between the wants and the needs so what

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.750 
between the wants and the needs so what
exactly<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.220> need<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.970> what<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.050> want<00:01:20.760> how

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
exactly is a need and what is a want how

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.090 
exactly is a need and what is a want how
do<00:01:21.820> we<00:01:21.970> make<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> distinction<00:01:22.780> well<00:01:23.680> let's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
do we make the distinction well let's

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.969 
do we make the distinction well let's
look<00:01:24.310> at<00:01:24.490> one<00:01:24.700> example<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:26.170> something<00:01:26.799> like<00:01:26.950> a

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
look at one example now something like a

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.340 
look at one example now something like a
physical<00:01:27.220> keyboard<00:01:27.670> would<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.720> say<00:01:28.930> it's<00:01:29.229> a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
physical keyboard would you say it's a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.179 
physical keyboard would you say it's a
need<00:01:29.590> or<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.860> want<00:01:31.530> done<00:01:32.530> thinking<00:01:32.890> about<00:01:33.010> it

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
need or a want done thinking about it

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.030 
need or a want done thinking about it
well<00:01:34.119> i<00:01:34.330> would<00:01:34.600> say<00:01:34.869> it's<00:01:35.140> definitely<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.710> one

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
well i would say it's definitely a one

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.920 
well i would say it's definitely a one
the<00:01:36.670> iphone<00:01:37.090> not<00:01:37.270> having<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.750> physical

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
the iphone not having a physical

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.840 
the iphone not having a physical
keyboard<00:01:38.380> doesn't<00:01:39.189> affect<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.670> performance

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
keyboard doesn't affect the performance

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.210 
keyboard doesn't affect the performance
of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.540> device<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:41.799> more<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.070> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
of the device this is more of a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.649 
of the device this is more of a
preference<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> user<00:01:43.240> which

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
preference of the user which

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.649 
preference of the user which
unfortunately<00:01:44.290> in<00:01:44.950> my<00:01:45.250> opinion<00:01:45.580> i<00:01:45.909> don't<00:01:46.509> see

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
unfortunately in my opinion i don't see

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.749 
unfortunately in my opinion i don't see
it<00:01:46.780> happening<00:01:46.900> anytime<00:01:47.409> soon<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:48.430> iphone<00:01:48.729> has

it happening anytime soon the iphone has

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.270 
it happening anytime soon the iphone has
definitely<00:01:49.420> prided<00:01:50.080> itself<00:01:50.170> on<00:01:50.740> being<00:01:50.799> a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
definitely prided itself on being a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.450 
definitely prided itself on being a
touch<00:01:51.549> only<00:01:51.759> device<00:01:52.409> now<00:01:53.409> there<00:01:53.830> are<00:01:53.860> lots<00:01:54.280> of
