00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.600
 Yo! Eleven from this page 

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.440
 And this is again Five Nights at Freddy's 4 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.000
 Today we will go the night of 9 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.360
 Night 9 is hidden in this game 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.340
 And it is not available anywhere in the main menu or anything like that 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.780
 You must apparently do ... 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.440
 ... something like that - Enter the game's save file and change the fifth to ninth night 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.920
 Then save the save 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.660
 And when we enter Continue, nothing will change, aaaallee ... 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280
 I tadah! 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.820
 And everyone thinks that night 9 is a game mistake ... 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.340
 ... although I do not think so. It was the same in the third part 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.160
 Night 7 was not really a game mistake, because Scott especially made the graphics for this game, by night 7, right? 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 So ... so ... 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.720
 It could not have been the same with myself 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 I hear there cars driving behind this ... too-behind-behind-the-window or something like that 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.060
 In the sense of the game 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.420
 But nothing is here 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.960
 Maybe something or something can be done 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.100
 It's too quiet 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.400
 Even Fredziacy is not there 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.420
 I do not know. Maybe it's a test night or something like that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.260
 Something was going on 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 Is it possible to die here? 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.460
 Is anything going on here for me? 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.680
 Because if not, it's even more frightening 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.660
 Nothing goes 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.480
 Although if it suddenly came and I jumped on the snout, I would get stuck, so ... 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.580
 Maybe 4AM will be Nightamare or Fredbear, or something like that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.000
 There's nothing here tonight. There is absolutely nothing like that 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.080
 It's five 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.620
 I know that in the second part during such a night there was a mistake that caused the camera to rise. Nothing worked 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.640
 And all night the lights were flashing in the office. Nothing more 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 So ... will we get something here at the end? I doubt it, because it would be loud about it, if someone did it 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.760
 Or rather they found it because someone wrote me that it was on YouTube 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.180
 But after all ... 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.820
 Well, in the third part, at least this night was hidden, somehow challenging, right? And here ... 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 O kuwa! There was something 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440
 Hey, there was something 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.460
 Now, at five in the morning ?! 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.880
 This is creepy (scary) 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.300
 * the sound of squeaking * 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.740
 And six in the morning. Okay * the sound of squeaking * 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.860
 * the sound of squeaking * 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 Will the game crash now? * the sound of squeaking * 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 Will they crash into the desktop? * the sound of squeaking * 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400
 Will something be for the ninth night? * the sound of squeaking * 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.080
 Is she ... * the sound of squeaking * 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.580
 * the sound of squeaking * 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.420
 ... leave something interesting behind? * the sound of squeaking * 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.140
 Normally the game works. Normally it is ... 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.420
 ... everything as it should be 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.360
 Is something unlocked in Extra? Let's check it out because you never know! 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.240
 I doubt it would be something, but I prefer to check anyway 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.520
 * jumpsacre sound * 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.800
 Oh, I just got down. good 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.600
 Oh, no, this is Nightmare! This is the night 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.120
 No, we're not looking for it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.880
 We can check in the game record if something has changed 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.280
 Em ... This is here 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.640
 I do not know 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.420
 I'm just wondering what's the test = 1 in the game's save file, but I do not want to check it out. Maybe somebody will do it, so apparently it would be enough 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.580
 Chicken. Detriment. I thought that night 9 would be somehow challenging. I thought that something here would be nice, and here * some sound (I do not know how to save it) * - flap 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.340
 * gibberish * all night nothing was only at five o'clock ... 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.820
 ... Fredziaaki have come. These small ones. Such Freddy's miniatures, right? 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.700
 Well, never mind 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.060
 So that would be it 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.540
 I do not know if there will be a movie with a summary of the whole of this Five Nights at Freddy's 4 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.840
 I do not know what to think about it. The game is generally ... rough 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.580
 It's great in this respect that you have to listen to something. This is the hardest to listen to 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.720
 In the second part, I tried to use it, this hearing to ... 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.280
 ... to know what is coming from which side, is it close, is it far away, whether it is coming from the right or left 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.840
 * gesture * I learned so much, because everything was in mono, I only heard everything in the middle, it was not stereo 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.700
 Whether something went from the right, or something went from the left, there was no difference, it was heard all the time in the middle 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.060
 And here you can hear stereo and it's awesome. He could have used it before. It would be much more interesting 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.020
 Practically we have so much that we have to wait for a movie from Five Nights at Freddy's, which will have real animatrons by the way 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.540
 Real mechanical robots, not CGI in the sense of computer graphics, which I really like 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.940
 If you want, Mandzio did a film about it. He mentioned something there 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.540
 I am not sure what yet, because I have not heard, but I know that they are doing something about it 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.140
 AND... 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 And at the most, we can wait for this DLC whole, or what is it there, kmini 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.020
 Changes the whole page 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.180
 It is not known what it will be. Anyway, I always say it will be the end of the original Five Nights at Freddy's story. Just like he said ... 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.620
 ..., that is the original story ... 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.540
 ... related to these animatrons, etc. 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.900
 Maybe he'll use another idea - he'll leave these animatrons. There will be something there with this pizzeria, etc., but there will be a completely different story 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.720
 Because it's like this, I did not say that anywhere, but this is the idea that came to my mind. Maybe the author simply ... 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.260
 ... made a game in which he invented a story and threw it, right? 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.020
 He just did. He did not know that this game would succeed. He had zero chance of it 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.840
 He said it himself and wrote there on the newspapers at the end of which part of the third one 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.500
 And ... the game suddenly became famous. People started to make theories and wanted more, so he did more - He invented * babble * of this story 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.600
 Then he came up a little more, but ... 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.660
 ... it was ill-conceived and there were things that he simply could not explain, he could not. He did not understand it himself, some of these things, right? 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.480
 MiaÅ‚- (That's a nice cat: P) 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.320
 The plot had a lot of holes and it has so far, that's why he wanted to explain the last thing in a tangled way ... 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.920
 ... what he did 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.920
 And then he probably decided now ... 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.240
 ... make a whole new part ... 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.100
 ... also associated with these bears or other bears of this type ... 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.600
 ... only a new, fresh story, which he will rethink ... from beginning to end. Let us put all three parts together, whether there are four parts, or a few of them 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.840
 It would make more sense if he had everything devised from beginning to end, right? 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.900
 So I think it will look like this. Maybe there will be Five Nights at Freddy's maybe Six Nights at ... 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.900
 ... My Mama's Ass or something, but there will still be something like this, right? In this style (Well, in such a way that we'll be in the ass ... This ...) 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.800
 I do not know 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.360
 It's just my speculation 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.500
 There will be some spin-off and that's it, so we'll see. 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.320
 That's it 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.180
 Hold on and see you ... 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.060
 Subtitles were written by Shijui-kun formerly known as Hypnom (The one who already wrote subtitles in Eleven's films). Time to make subtitles: ~ 2 hours. and 40min. 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.340
 ... in other movies 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.040
 For now
