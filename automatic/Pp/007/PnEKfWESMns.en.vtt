00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.560
(JUSTIN PECK)
Well, there's a famous saying by 
George Balanchine that reads,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.700
"There's-- there's no new steps,
only new combinations."

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.120
So it's about pulling from sort of 
movement vocabulary

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.300
that's already in existence and tweak, 
or alter that, or formulate that into

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.980
something new and original.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.760
I think each ballet I create is 
very much a part of who I am

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.980
at that moment in time.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.260
And a lot of the ideas are very 
personal ideas that I think about a lot,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.060
that eventually get folded into
the workings of the ballet itself.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.500
Something that I really prefer when 
I'm creating new works

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.180
is working with a large cast
because it adds a lot more possibility.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.220
So it starts, for me, listening to the 
music hundreds and hundreds of times.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.660
And sort of combing through the score,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.140
and trying to pick up on the subtle
details and the nuances within that.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.200
And then from there,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400
I start to formulate ideas 
based on that music.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.220
The next step for my process is to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.140
sort of use my-- my own body 
as my instrument.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:22.040
And now you piqué, plié, and then
almost, like, let the arm, uh, linger.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.220
I also spend a lot of time sketching
and drawing patterns and formations.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.640
I get in to the studio with the dancers.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640
Usually I begin with the 
principal dancers,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.820
sort of the leading dancers 
in the ballet.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.380
And I work through the 
movement with them.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.960
The ideas I have are thrown at these 
dancers, and they kind of

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420
meet me halfway.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.840
And the idea turns into something else 
based on the chemistry that occurs

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.240
between myself and a specific dancer.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.660
And then there's a lot of time spent 
working with the corps de ballet.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.619
Making sure they move in an 
interesting and efficient manner.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.520
The next step would-- would be to add 
the additional elements of lighting,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.660
and costumes, and set design,
if that applies.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.120
It's hard for me to objectively 
assess my own work,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.980
because I'm so inside of it, 
but I've been told from others

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.360
that they really admire the group work
and the group patterns.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.560
And I think that maybe the way 
that my ballets have been formatted,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.360
so far, is not so...

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.820
kind of like cut and dry, 
with the format of it.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.600
It's constantly moving and 
shifting and changing,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.800
and there's moments when there's a
solo dancer performing

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800
and then they get absorbed
 into the corps,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.480
and then it changes into maybe like a 
pas de deux and it's not so obvious.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.560
I think. I hope, at least.
