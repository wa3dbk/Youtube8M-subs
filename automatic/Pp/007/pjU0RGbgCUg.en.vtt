if you have old wiring harness that's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.220 
if you have old wiring harness that's
already<00:00:56.100> being<00:00:56.370> overtaxed<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:57.960> nice

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
already being overtaxed it's also nice

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
already being overtaxed it's also nice
when<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> new<00:00:59.579> modern<00:01:00.090> switches<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
when you have new modern switches that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.900 
when you have new modern switches that
don't<00:01:01.079> quite<00:01:01.440> meet<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> old<00:01:02.430> standards

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
don't quite meet up to the old standards

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
don't quite meet up to the old standards
and<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.090> burn<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.510> quicker<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.019> it's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and they burn out quicker because it's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.649 
and they burn out quicker because it's
too<00:01:04.559> much<00:01:04.769> power<00:01:05.010> being<00:01:05.250> drawn<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.850> because

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
too much power being drawn and because

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
too much power being drawn and because
they're<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> D<00:01:08.030> they<00:01:09.030> don't<00:01:09.299> produce

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
they're now I D they don't produce

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.959 
is not necessarily what I'm seeing I've
experimented<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.520> played<00:02:05.820> around

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
experimented and I have played around

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.380 
experimented and I have played around
with<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> camera<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
with the camera I

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.270 
with the camera I
do<00:02:07.600> what<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:07.810> can<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.170> see<00:02:08.410> what<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.649> can<00:02:08.890> do<00:02:09.009> to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
do what I can to see what I can do to

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.309 
do what I can to see what I can do to
give<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:10.539> effect<00:02:10.750> through<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
give this the right effect through the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.880 
give this the right effect through the
camera<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.069> can't<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.620> probably

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
camera and I can't so you probably

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.830 
camera and I can't so you probably
aren't<00:02:15.220> seeing<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.700> red<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.060> I've<00:02:16.209> seen<00:02:16.510> but

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
aren't seeing the red that I've seen but

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.870 
aren't seeing the red that I've seen but
these<00:02:17.020> are<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> very<00:02:17.530> bright<00:02:17.800> red<00:02:17.860> now<00:02:18.550> take<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
these are a very bright red now take a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.059 
these are a very bright red now take a
look<00:02:19.090> at<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.569> top<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.170> bottom<00:02:20.290> notice

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
look at the top and the bottom notice

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.610 
look at the top and the bottom notice
something<00:02:21.370> strange<00:02:21.520> about<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.440> have

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
something strange about this if you have

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.260 
something strange about this if you have
a<00:02:23.650> late-model<00:02:23.890> MGB<00:02:24.670> or<00:02:24.820> if<00:02:24.910> you've<00:02:25.030> driven

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
a late-model MGB or if you've driven

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.600 
a late-model MGB or if you've driven
behind<00:02:25.780> when<00:02:25.959> long<00:02:26.170> enough<00:02:26.380> you'll<00:02:27.280> notice

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
behind when long enough you'll notice

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.690 
behind when long enough you'll notice
that<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:28.690> only<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.260> portion<00:02:29.700> parking

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
that not only this portion parking

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.900 
that not only this portion parking
lights<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.450> red<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.860> red<00:02:33.100> but<00:02:33.790> when

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
lights is red but this is red but when

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.229 
lights is red but this is red but when
it's<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.200> Amber<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.220> red<00:02:36.459> this

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it's on this is Amber this is red this

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.530 
it's on this is Amber this is red this
is<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.630> safety<00:02:37.930> defect<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.670> both<00:02:40.120> boards

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
is one safety defect in that both boards

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.500 
is one safety defect in that both boards
actually<00:02:41.020> light<00:02:41.200> up<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.790> turn<00:02:43.030> signal<00:02:43.390> is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
actually light up the turn signal is

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.740 
actually light up the turn signal is
built<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> bottom<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.300> also<00:02:46.450> comes

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
built to the bottom and it also comes

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
built to the bottom and it also comes
through<00:02:46.959> with<00:02:47.170> LEDs<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.800> both<00:02:48.070> sides<00:02:48.430> that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
through with LEDs on both sides that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.120 
through with LEDs on both sides that
come<00:02:49.390> through<00:02:49.570> outside<00:02:50.050> anyone<00:02:50.890> alongside

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
come through outside anyone alongside

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
come through outside anyone alongside
you<00:02:51.550> will<00:02:51.910> know<00:02:52.510> which<00:02:52.720> way<00:02:52.989> you're<00:02:53.230> turning

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.970 

and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:59.100> parking<00:03:00.100> there's<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.060> brake<00:03:01.269> light

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and then parking there's the brake light

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.320 
and then parking there's the brake light
even<00:03:02.980> though<00:03:03.100> right<00:03:03.459> at<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.790> moment<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.300> have

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
even though right at this moment I have

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.440 
even though right at this moment I have
all<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> lights<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.739> our<00:03:05.860> shop<00:03:06.100> I'm<00:03:07.000> seeing

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
all the lights on in our shop I'm seeing

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.420 
all the lights on in our shop I'm seeing
red<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.590> far<00:03:08.830> white<00:03:09.250> wall<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:11.190> by<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> way

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
red on the far white wall and by the way

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.610 
red on the far white wall and by the way
if<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.640> watch<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.900> will<00:03:14.049> see<00:03:14.079> that<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
if you watch you will see that the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.319 
if you watch you will see that the
parking<00:03:15.130> lights<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.489> have<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> few<00:03:15.970> separate

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
parking lights do have a few separate

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.479 
parking lights do have a few separate
bulbs<00:03:16.660> as<00:03:17.079> well<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.680> can<00:03:17.920> definitely<00:03:18.130> tell

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
bulbs as well so you can definitely tell

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:26.430 
bulbs as well so you can definitely tell
when<00:03:18.549> both<00:03:18.910> are<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:24.209> anyways<00:03:25.209> as<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.480> said<00:03:25.750> it

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
when both are on anyways as I said it

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.930 
when both are on anyways as I said it
doesn't<00:03:26.680> come<00:03:26.980> through<00:03:27.010> on<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.340> camera<00:03:27.519> point

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
doesn't come through on the camera point

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.640 
doesn't come through on the camera point
right<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.660> they<00:03:28.780> are<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> really<00:03:29.230> nice<00:03:29.440> in
