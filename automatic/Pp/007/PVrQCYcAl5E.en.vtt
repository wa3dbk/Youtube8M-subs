through this okay so for this particular
there's<00:05:09.780> almost<00:05:09.990> 200,000<00:05:10.919> go<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:12.240> very

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
there's almost 200,000 go and a very

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.830 
there's almost 200,000 go and a very
very<00:05:12.780> low<00:05:12.990> amount<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.710> elixir<00:05:14.310> but<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:15.720> know<00:05:15.810> I

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
very low amount of elixir but you know I

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.340 
very low amount of elixir but you know I
have<00:05:16.050> enough<00:05:16.320> Enix<00:05:16.620> also<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:18.030> test<00:05:18.360> about<00:05:18.690> 300

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
have enough Enix also and test about 300

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.710 
have enough Enix also and test about 300
it<00:05:19.710> looks<00:05:19.980> so<00:05:20.220> something<00:05:20.940> that<00:05:21.120> maybe<00:05:21.540> I

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
it looks so something that maybe I

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.659 
it looks so something that maybe I
should<00:05:21.990> take<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.200> look<00:05:22.410> out<00:05:22.650> for<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:23.280> can<00:05:23.460> see

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
should take a look out for you can see

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.370 
should take a look out for you can see
that<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.940> air<00:05:24.150> defense<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.630> relatively<00:05:25.080> low

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
that the air defense is relatively low

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.580 
that the air defense is relatively low
level<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.760> wizard<00:05:27.600> how<00:05:27.720> also<00:05:28.080> very<00:05:28.380> low

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
level and the wizard how also very low

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.340 
level and the wizard how also very low
level<00:05:28.919> so<00:05:29.100> my<00:05:29.580> objective<00:05:30.180> now<00:05:30.690> is<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.870> take<00:05:31.169> out
