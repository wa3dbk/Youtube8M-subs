00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
way so it'll be very easy to use so once
inside<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> vehicle<00:01:30.030> you'll<00:01:30.180> find<00:01:30.480> your<00:01:30.600> 12

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
inside the vehicle you'll find your 12

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
inside the vehicle you'll find your 12
volt<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.440> here<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.890> dash<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.520> gonna

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
volt down here on the dash you're gonna

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.480 
volt down here on the dash you're gonna
plug<00:01:32.910> straight<00:01:33.300> in<00:01:33.770> from<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:34.980> with<00:01:35.370> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
plug straight in from there with the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
plug straight in from there with the
push-button<00:01:35.880> start<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.600> sure<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.870> press<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
push-button start make sure you press it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
push-button start make sure you press it
twice<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.800> turn<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> accessories<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.910> and

twice to turn the accessories on and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.430 
twice to turn the accessories on and
then<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.510> will<00:01:39.660> give<00:01:39.840> power<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.260> the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
then that will give power to the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.170 
then that will give power to the
compressor<00:01:40.980> now<00:01:41.580> we're<00:01:41.760> gonna<00:01:41.850> jump<00:01:42.120> back

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
compressor now we're gonna jump back

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
compressor now we're gonna jump back
outside<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:42.930> vehicle<00:01:43.320> I'll<00:01:43.410> show<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.650> how

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.290 
and there you'll notice the yellow cap
the<00:02:01.680> compressor<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.340> gonna<00:02:02.520> screw<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.030> into

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
the compressor is gonna screw right into

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.760 
the compressor is gonna screw right into
the<00:02:03.420> top<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:03.900> which<00:02:04.170> we're<00:02:04.380> not<00:02:04.500> actually

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the top here which we're not actually

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.290 
the top here which we're not actually
going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.280> today<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.910> would<00:02:06.030> put<00:02:06.150> it

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
going to do today but you would put it

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.880 
going to do today but you would put it
right<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.540> there<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.800> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
right in there and then this is going to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
right in there and then this is going to
go<00:02:08.040> directly<00:02:08.340> onto<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.090> valve<00:02:09.270> stick<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.170> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
go directly onto the valve stick so I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.660 
go directly onto the valve stick so I
can<00:02:10.380> show<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> how<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.040> part<00:02:11.310> quick

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.160 

so<00:02:14.670> you'll<00:02:14.820> screw<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.240> right<00:02:15.510> onto<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:16.050> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
so you'll screw this right onto here and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500 
so you'll screw this right onto here and
then<00:02:16.740> once<00:02:17.010> you've<00:02:17.160> connected<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.090> well

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
then once you've connected this as well

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.090 
then once you've connected this as well
the<00:02:18.810> sealant<00:02:19.230> you'll<00:02:19.380> notice<00:02:19.680> will<00:02:19.830> fill

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the sealant you'll notice will fill

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.980 
the sealant you'll notice will fill
right<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.400> into<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.850> tire<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.660> when<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
right up into the tire so when that

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.200 
right up into the tire so when that
pressure<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.710> there's<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.760> button<00:02:24.030> on

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
pressure is on there's one button on

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.040 
pressure is on there's one button on
your<00:02:24.330> compressor<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.080> simply<00:02:25.740> press<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
your compressor just simply press it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
your compressor just simply press it
that<00:02:28.050> will<00:02:28.200> kick<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:29.100> go<00:02:29.250> right<00:02:29.490> into

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
that will kick on and then go right into

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250 
that will kick on and then go right into
the<00:02:29.850> tire<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.630> you're<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.870> want<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.080> make
