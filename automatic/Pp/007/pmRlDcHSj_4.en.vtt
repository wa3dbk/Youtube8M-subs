that used to be like it's your one deck
but<00:00:17.490> up<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.910> still<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> decent<00:00:18.359> deck<00:00:19.100> oh<00:00:20.510> but

our player in the red happens I have
future<00:00:23.430> fusion<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.359> card<00:00:24.539> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
future fusion and that card is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960 
future fusion and that card is
absolutely<00:00:25.260> amazing<00:00:25.529> especially<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.849> your

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
absolutely amazing especially when your

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.040 
absolutely amazing especially when your
opponent<00:00:27.680> can't<00:00:28.680> chain<00:00:28.920> MST<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.210> our<00:00:30.810> plan

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
opponent can't chain MST and our plan

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.400 
opponent can't chain MST and our plan
the<00:00:31.170> red<00:00:31.289> luckily<00:00:31.650> hit<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> opponent's<00:00:32.850> MST

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
the red luckily hit the opponent's MST

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.299 
the red luckily hit the opponent's MST
otherwise<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.559> would<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.829> able<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> send

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
otherwise he would not be able to send

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.889 
otherwise he would not be able to send
cards<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> graveyard<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
cards to the graveyard and that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.119 
cards to the graveyard and that
essentially<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.649> does<00:00:37.920> hurt<00:00:38.100> dragons

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
essentially really does hurt dragons

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
essentially really does hurt dragons
because<00:00:41.129> sometimes<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.730> clog<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.030> hand

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
because sometimes you can clog your hand

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
because sometimes you can clog your hand
with<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.930> high<00:00:43.140> level<00:00:43.290> dragons<00:00:43.800> if

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
with like really high level dragons if

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.670 
with like really high level dragons if
you<00:00:44.489> happen<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.940> playing<00:00:45.149> them

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
you happen to be playing them

really really met a card uh well not so
much<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.519> moment<00:02:29.910> I'd<00:02:29.970> say<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.500> he

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
much that this moment I'd say but you he

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.759 
much that this moment I'd say but you he
can<00:02:32.220> solve<00:02:32.640> judgment<00:02:33.150> Nick<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:34.320> thing<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.530> now

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
can solve judgment Nick the thing is now

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.220 
can solve judgment Nick the thing is now
it<00:02:38.180> yeah<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.760> could<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.120> uh<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.750> he<00:02:42.989> has<00:02:43.080> like

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it yeah you could just uh if he has like

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.130 
it yeah you could just uh if he has like
chaos<00:02:43.680> monsters<00:02:44.600> he<00:02:45.600> can<00:02:45.750> kind<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.959> push

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
chaos monsters he can kind of push

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.550 
chaos monsters he can kind of push
really<00:02:46.320> hard<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.980> uh<00:02:47.780> exhales<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:49.019> summon

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
really hard but uh exhales can summon

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.670 
really hard but uh exhales can summon
airbone<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.760> take<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> cards<00:02:51.959> out<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> hand

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
airbone and take a cards out of the hand

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.620 
airbone and take a cards out of the hand
so<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.280> possible<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.730> our<00:02:53.850> blue<00:02:54.480> could

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
so it's possible that our blue could

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.670 
so it's possible that our blue could
still<00:02:54.840> actually<00:02:54.989> come<00:02:55.230> back<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:56.310> uh<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> he's

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
still actually come back but uh so he's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430 
still actually come back but uh so he's
checking<00:02:58.829> his<00:02:59.010> grave<00:02:59.310> yard<00:02:59.519> out<00:02:59.610> it<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:01.140> he<00:03:01.290> can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
checking his grave yard out it if he can

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.250 
checking his grave yard out it if he can
just<00:03:01.470> summon<00:03:01.709> really<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.600> very<00:03:03.600> stark<00:03:03.810> metal

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
just summon really a very stark metal

home night has the effect once per turn
when<00:03:20.430> your<00:03:20.670> opponent<00:03:21.239> declares<00:03:21.510> an<00:03:21.570> attack

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
when your opponent declares an attack

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.890 
when your opponent declares an attack
and<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.030> special<00:03:24.570> from<00:03:24.780> false<00:03:25.049> role<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.640> I

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
and and a special from false role and I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.690 
and and a special from false role and I
can't<00:03:27.900> hurt<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> summer<00:03:29.610> of

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
can't hurt here and then a summer of

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.180 
can't hurt here and then a summer of
dark<00:03:29.940> souls<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:31.470> he<00:03:31.769> should<00:03:31.950> go<00:03:31.980> for

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
dark souls so I think he should go for

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.130 
dark souls so I think he should go for
he<00:03:32.310> had<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.610> Kelly<00:03:33.239> would<00:03:33.269> be<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.570> great<00:03:33.900> card

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
he had like Kelly would be a great card

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.039 
he had like Kelly would be a great card
to<00:03:34.260> go<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.650> who<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.459> doesn't<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.120> no<00:03:36.390> don't

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
to go for who and doesn't what no don't

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.500 
to go for who and doesn't what no don't
do<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.970> don't<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
do that I don't know if that was the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.830 
do that I don't know if that was the
best<00:03:39.630> idea<00:03:39.780> there<00:03:40.170> because<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.980> all<00:03:41.630> yeah<00:03:42.630> that

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
best idea there because of all yeah that

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.030 
best idea there because of all yeah that
just<00:03:42.870> didn't<00:03:43.410> seem<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.709> good<00:03:43.799> option

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
just didn't seem like a good option

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.490 
just didn't seem like a good option
because<00:03:44.630> he<00:03:45.630> could<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.900> went<00:03:45.989> from<00:03:46.109> full

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
because he could have went from full

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.750 
because he could have went from full
night<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.800> then<00:03:46.920> got<00:03:47.160> back<00:03:47.400> something

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
night and then got back something

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.970 
night and then got back something
because<00:03:48.180> why<00:03:48.660> special<00:03:49.170> someone<00:03:49.410> cultural<00:03:49.830> if

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
because why special someone cultural if

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.110 
because why special someone cultural if
you're<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.220> going<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.400> use<00:03:50.490> its<00:03:50.670> effect<00:03:50.760> i

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
you're not going to use its effect i

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.270 
you're not going to use its effect i
mean<00:03:51.270> really<00:03:51.990> like<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.680> had<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.950> option<00:03:53.100> to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
mean really like you had the option to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.320 
mean really like you had the option to
use<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.520> effect<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:53.850> you're<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.270> to

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
use the effect but you're just going to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.320 
use the effect but you're just going to
tribute<00:03:54.540> dark<00:03:54.720> slits<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.400> because<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.790> need

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
tribute dark slits and because you need

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.360 
tribute dark slits and because you need
an<00:03:57.420> answer<00:03:57.630> for<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.530> huge<00:03:58.980> five<00:03:59.190> headed

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
an answer for that a huge five headed

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.040 
an answer for that a huge five headed
dragon<00:03:59.460> that's<00:03:59.850> going<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.180> come<00:04:00.270> out<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.540> i

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
dragon that's going to come out and i

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.900 
dragon that's going to come out and i
think<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.440> really<00:04:01.620> where<00:04:01.920> our<00:04:01.950> xx-saber

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
think that's really where our xx-saber

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.790 
think that's really where our xx-saber
player<00:04:03.180> made<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.540> mistake<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.620> is

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
player made the mistake and that is

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.990 
player made the mistake and that is
probably<00:04:04.980> going<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.280> be<00:04:05.400> costing<00:04:05.850> him<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
probably going to be costing him the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.870 
probably going to be costing him the
game<00:04:06.240> going<00:04:07.140> for<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.380> hen<00:04:07.650> light<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.070> then<00:04:08.580> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
game going for a hen light and then I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.940 
game going for a hen light and then I
mean<00:04:09.600> he<00:04:09.690> still<00:04:09.750> gets<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.110> darcel<00:04:10.470> search<00:04:10.620> but

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
mean he still gets a darcel search but

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.800 
mean he still gets a darcel search but
if<00:04:11.550> you<00:04:11.670> vote<00:04:11.790> for<00:04:11.820> Hyun<00:04:12.120> light<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.510> then<00:04:12.660> he

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
if you vote for Hyun light and then he

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.060 
if you vote for Hyun light and then he
could<00:04:12.930> have<00:04:13.020> gotten<00:04:13.230> back<00:04:13.440> something<00:04:13.740> and

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
could have gotten back something and

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.949 
could have gotten back something and
then<00:04:14.670> um<00:04:14.940> he<00:04:15.840> could<00:04:16.079> have<00:04:16.880> no<00:04:17.880> SAT<00:04:18.120> there<00:04:18.299> with

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
then um he could have no SAT there with

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.590 
then um he could have no SAT there with
another<00:04:19.560> fall<00:04:20.010> night<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.519> being<00:04:21.239> able<00:04:21.419> to

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
another fall night and being able to

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.360 
another fall night and being able to
block<00:04:21.780> another<00:04:22.049> attack<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:23.130> would<00:04:23.280> be

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
block another attack and that would be

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.050 
block another attack and that would be
quite<00:04:23.520> good<00:04:23.880> um<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.310> let's<00:04:26.460> see<00:04:26.550> maybe<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:26.970> he

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
quite good um so let's see maybe so he

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.090 
quite good um so let's see maybe so he
wants<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.300> tribute<00:04:27.660> once<00:04:27.930> again<00:04:28.230> just<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.530> get

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
wants a tribute once again just to get

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.530 
wants a tribute once again just to get
rid<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> card<00:04:29.580> in<00:04:29.760> looks<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.090> he<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.419> going

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
rid of the card in looks and he is going

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.210 
rid of the card in looks and he is going
to<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.720> doing<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.050> but<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.650> thing<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:31.860> he

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
to be doing that but the thing is he

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.020 
to be doing that but the thing is he
still<00:04:32.640> needs<00:04:32.970> an<00:04:33.120> answer<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.040> ah<00:04:35.040> private

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
still needs an answer to that ah private

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.150 
still needs an answer to that ah private
of<00:04:36.120> dragons<00:04:36.510> gonna<00:04:36.630> be<00:04:36.720> coming<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.320> I

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
of dragons gonna be coming out and I

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.790 
of dragons gonna be coming out and I
don't<00:04:38.640> think<00:04:38.940> he<00:04:39.060> can<00:04:39.240> be<00:04:39.330> doing<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.080> don't

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
don't think he can be doing that I don't

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.840 
don't think he can be doing that I don't
think<00:04:40.860> he<00:04:41.040> looked<00:04:41.280> be<00:04:41.430> able<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.640> have<00:04:41.730> an

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
think he looked be able to have an

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.020 
think he looked be able to have an
answer<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:44.040> he<00:04:44.070> does<00:04:44.280> get<00:04:44.400> his<00:04:44.550> darcel<00:04:44.880> search

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
answer so he does get his darcel search

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.850 
answer so he does get his darcel search
so<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.990> let's<00:04:46.140> see<00:04:46.290> what<00:04:46.320> he<00:04:46.530> adds<00:04:46.740> um<00:04:48.860> he's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
so so let's see what he adds um he's

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.050 
so so let's see what he adds um he's
adding<00:04:50.100> another<00:04:50.280> fault<00:04:50.520> or<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:50.760> he<00:04:50.880> perhaps

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
adding another fault or so he perhaps

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.950 
adding another fault or so he perhaps
has<00:04:51.360> an<00:04:51.479> X<00:04:51.630> saber<00:04:51.840> in<00:04:52.020> his<00:04:52.110> hand<00:04:52.850> but<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.810> mean

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
has an X saber in his hand but I mean

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.260 
has an X saber in his hand but I mean
the<00:04:55.229> dragon<00:04:55.590> player<00:04:55.770> realistically<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.700> might

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
the dragon player realistically it might

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.210 
the dragon player realistically it might
not<00:04:57.540> have<00:04:57.750> been<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:59.130> bad<00:04:59.400> enough<00:04:59.850> idea

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
not have been that bad enough idea

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.650 
not have been that bad enough idea
should<00:05:02.220> just<00:05:02.490> discard<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.180> hand<00:05:03.390> because

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
should just discard the hand because

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.930 
should just discard the hand because
basically<00:05:04.229> our<00:05:04.590> player<00:05:04.800> in<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.160> red<00:05:05.370> needs<00:05:05.729> to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
basically our player in the red needs to

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.500 
basically our player in the red needs to
get<00:05:06.120> out<00:05:06.270> something<00:05:08.900> strong<00:05:09.900> enough<00:05:09.930> um<00:05:11.510> to

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
get out something strong enough um to

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.940 
get out something strong enough um to
survive<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.200> don't<00:05:13.380> know<00:05:13.500> if<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.740> do<00:05:13.860> this

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
survive I don't know if you can do this

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.930 
survive I don't know if you can do this
because<00:05:14.100> now<00:05:14.310> he's<00:05:14.430> just<00:05:14.460> going<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.700> go<00:05:14.790> for

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
because now he's just going to go for

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.250 
because now he's just going to go for
Paul<00:05:15.090> troll<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:17.479> he<00:05:18.479> should<00:05:18.750> be<00:05:18.900> able<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.110> take

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
Paul troll and he should be able to take

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.610 
Paul troll and he should be able to take
the<00:05:19.380> game<00:05:19.500> on<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:19.770> fall<00:05:20.669> trolls<00:05:20.910> effect<00:05:21.620> see

the game on this fall trolls effect see

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.250 
the game on this fall trolls effect see
what<00:05:22.740> he<00:05:22.890> goes<00:05:23.070> for<00:05:23.540> yeah<00:05:24.540> I<00:05:24.570> think<00:05:24.720> home<00:05:25.110> that

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
what he goes for yeah I think home that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.930 
what he goes for yeah I think home that
would<00:05:25.350> have<00:05:25.470> been<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.680> bad<00:05:25.919> option<00:05:26.100> because<00:05:26.820> no

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
would have been a bad option because no

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.480 
would have been a bad option because no
no<00:05:27.180> no<00:05:27.330> no<00:05:27.479> see<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.500> guys<00:05:28.620> can<00:05:28.770> see<00:05:28.830> another

no no no see as you guys can see another
mistake<00:05:29.970> he<00:05:30.630> should<00:05:30.840> have<00:05:30.960> synchro<00:05:31.260> Doug<00:05:31.410> for

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
mistake he should have synchro Doug for

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.200 
mistake he should have synchro Doug for
Brian<00:05:31.800> ack<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:32.250> then<00:05:32.460> bounce<00:05:32.580> back<00:05:32.940> the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
Brian ack and then bounce back the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.880 
Brian ack and then bounce back the
monster<00:05:33.570> card<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.470> essentially

monster card and that essentially

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.290 
monster card and that essentially
definitely<00:05:35.640> would<00:05:35.729> have<00:05:35.760> been<00:05:35.910> game<00:05:36.060> but<00:05:36.210> we

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
definitely would have been game but we

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.430 
definitely would have been game but we
can<00:05:36.419> see<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.660> best<00:05:36.840> place<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.229> we<00:05:37.290> could

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
can see the best place and we could

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.350 
can see the best place and we could
learn<00:05:37.560> phone<00:05:37.800> because<00:05:38.550> that's<00:05:38.760> all<00:05:38.970> that<00:05:39.210> well

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
learn phone because that's all that well

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.700 
learn phone because that's all that well
