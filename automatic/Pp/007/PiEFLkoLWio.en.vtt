00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.940
 hey people and welcome to such a 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.590
 new video on a channel today 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.110
 I'll explain why this year the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.669
 bank robbery does not come out what is 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.460
 the reason where is the problem of 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.880
 rockstar games so i have two 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.130
 coincidentally on the internet found what 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 certain net world the ign has rockstar 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.599
 times written games and rockstar 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.750
 games has written back there are 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.040
 heap problems on the next one 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.330
 translate everything 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.729
 this and other things as I said left 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.589
 as the description looks over you 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.540
 is really through times and just write 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.100
 really you opinion in the comments 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.559
 maybe you could talk to each other 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.699
 Questions have been planned and your opinion 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.610
 write in the comments 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.479
 Each player must be level 12 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.510
 its okay we are almost all then must 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.670
 Help a leader give this 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.020
 leader needs on the dwelling house 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.549
 luxury house no matter which one this leader 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.869
 the crew determines which members in 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.580
 allowed to do his work 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.680
 that means you have no crew coming 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.480
 like to come in with me I have enough space 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 about 200 people are still with me 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.330
 purely 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.700
 so is the bank's good in it should 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.240
 About three people look for it 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.200
 The leader starts with true attacks 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.360
 is the boss then lead too 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.570
 example with you the plan 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.320
 how exactly do we use before 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.440
 For example, we use a gas mask 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.970
 smoke grenades or something or very quietly 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.510
 with muffler or know that me 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.890
 Eight and example only yes or agree with 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.690
 ak 47 or things just like that 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 said the guide then concludes 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.200
 okay so much before we do that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.799
 And finally, this is what this leads to 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.700
 splitting it is cool here so that is 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.640
 means the driver of almost only outside 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.230
 in front of the bank there is no power and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.470
 the other three people do almost everything 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.480
 that means, for example, the driver 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.580
 her flour danger says something boring 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.349
 something not so far comes with 10,000 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.909
 and the other three games gets 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.069
 20,000 approximately so then there is here 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.769
 even more information as I said 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.459
 over translation to the next there's 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.610
 problems 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.180
 then there's that just mentioned 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.610
 have the driver in front of the bench is one 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.310
 mussawi be busy and not 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.140
 all 1 car sitting was Minister of the Environment 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.069
 figuratively just stupid 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.780
 yes, I do not think that one will be ten 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.120
 minutes happened from the bank and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.220
 wait until you come out again that is 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.709
 shit and but like a rockstar 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.450
 games there which come to leave 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.129
 But the driver looks busy 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.799
 Maybe that does not bring a round one 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.510
 or killed live I know really minute 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.190
 not what he can or can do 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.140
 probably short in the magician 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.660
 I really do not know what rockstar games 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 because everything still does as I said a few 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.129
 information just lets through 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 I already read through everything and almost 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.250
 what i already like grass is here as 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.329
 do well as employment for so long 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.950
 get 20 new mission building cool stands 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.049
 should definitely be on the bottom 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.579
 and write your opinion in the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.620
 comments and please leave a thumb 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.620
