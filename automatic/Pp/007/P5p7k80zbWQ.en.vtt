enough bananas so he can weigh down the
other<00:00:21.359> side<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> switch<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> trough<00:00:25.099> can

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
other side of the switch so trough can

we<00:00:40.310> would<00:00:40.430> have<00:00:40.550> thought<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:40.850> bananas<00:00:41.270> would

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
we would have thought the bananas would

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:52.670 
we would have thought the bananas would
make<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:41.750> fat

and<00:00:53.130> the<00:00:53.220> door<00:00:53.370> signifies<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.330> they<00:00:54.450> want<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
and the door signifies so they want a

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:13.750 
and the door signifies so they want a
decayed<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.350> either<00:00:55.530> side

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
here's the first boss of the game he's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
here's the first boss of the game he's

and he has giant cannons contained
within<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.540> shell<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> he<00:01:39.630> looks<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.990> he<00:01:40.229> can

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
within the shell so he looks like he can

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.560 
within the shell so he looks like he can
be<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> force<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> reckoned<00:01:41.430> with

let's finish this sucker and fatigue
videogames<00:03:16.220> have<00:03:16.400> taught<00:03:16.610> us<00:03:16.640> anything<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.360> he

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
videogames have taught us anything so he

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:25.900 
videogames have taught us anything so he
is<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.870> magic<00:03:18.200> number<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.730> magic

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
is the magic number and it's the magic

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.089 
is the magic number and it's the magic
number<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.660> case<00:03:26.720> as<00:03:27.170> well<00:03:29.709> he<00:03:30.709> runs<00:03:30.950> away

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
number in this case as well he runs away

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:46.900 
number in this case as well he runs away
like<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.489> coward<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.030> lisas<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.540> first<00:03:32.780> DK<00:03:33.230> key

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.140 

and<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.420> we<00:03:48.630> completed<00:03:49.080> our<00:03:49.260> first<00:03:49.560> bus

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.880 

we're<00:03:54.150> moving<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:54.660> along<00:03:57.590> what<00:03:58.590> the<00:04:00.890> exits

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
we're moving right along what the exits

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.790 
we're moving right along what the exits
over<00:04:02.160> here<00:04:05.870> now<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.260> leave<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:10.500> we<00:04:10.620> will

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
over here now we can leave but we will

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.280 
over here now we can leave but we will
be<00:04:10.950> coming<00:04:11.280> back<00:04:11.490> once<00:04:11.850> we<00:04:12.000> have<00:04:12.570> rescued<00:04:13.140> the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
and since we have a DK key let's go

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.830 
and since we have a DK key let's go
visit<00:04:39.920> Calum<00:04:40.490> Z<00:04:40.730> again<00:04:40.940> see<00:04:41.570> if<00:04:41.600> he<00:04:41.750> has

anything<00:04:42.110> tell<00:04:42.500> us

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.260 

he's<00:05:10.729> happy<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.180> we<00:05:12.020> brought<00:05:12.229> him<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.409> key<00:05:13.270> so

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
he's happy that we brought him a key so

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:34.549 
he's happy that we brought him a key so
he<00:05:14.509> opens<00:05:14.870> up<00:05:15.020> another<00:05:15.349> level<00:05:15.740> for<00:05:15.889> us

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:34.559 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.789

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:36.799 
okay we'll show you how to get up there

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:41.479 
okay we'll show you how to get up there
and<00:05:37.819> then<00:05:38.819> we'll<00:05:39.059> call<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.599> game<00:05:39.779> we'll<00:05:40.619> stop

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
you should be able to get up here

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:06.620 
you should be able to get up here
earlier<00:06:00.050> on<00:06:00.289> I<00:06:02.080> just<00:06:03.080> chose<00:06:03.410> not<00:06:03.440> to

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.920 

that's<00:06:07.200> simple

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.370 

and<00:06:15.930> we<00:06:16.650> are<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:16.860> decays<00:06:17.810> right<00:06:18.810> here<00:06:19.170> right

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
and we are in decays right here right
