00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the first step is to find your chain I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
the first step is to find your chain I
got<00:00:19.800> mine<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.130> local<00:00:20.310> fabric<00:00:20.699> store<00:00:20.730> and

got mine in my local fabric store and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060 
got mine in my local fabric store and
while<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.050> measured<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.830> on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
my wrist and got three equal pieces use

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
my wrist and got three equal pieces use
two<00:00:26.609> contrasting<00:00:27.029> colors<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> ribbon<00:00:27.869> I'm

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
make a note now we're going to go into

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
make a note now we're going to go into
our<00:00:47.370> second<00:00:47.700> piece<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
our second piece and go up through the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.880 
our second piece and go up through the
first<00:00:49.020> chain<00:00:49.440> link<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:52.710> gonna

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
first chain link and you're also gonna

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.970 
first chain link and you're also gonna
tie<00:00:53.129> enough<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> made<00:00:55.680> two

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
tie enough as you can see I made two

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
tie enough as you can see I made two
knots<00:00:56.239> now<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.390> gonna<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> piece<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
knots now I'm just gonna use a piece of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
knots now I'm just gonna use a piece of
tape<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> tape<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.829> ribbon<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.340> here

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
tape to tape down the ribbon right here

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
tape to tape down the ribbon right here
so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.449> work<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.989> won't<00:01:01.079> fly

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so I can really work and it won't fly

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.229 
so I can really work and it won't fly
around<00:01:01.859> everywhere<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:02.969> we're<00:01:03.120> gonna

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
around everywhere so now we're gonna

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
around everywhere so now we're gonna
repeat<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> same<00:01:03.870> technique<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.530> whole<00:01:04.799> way

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
repeat the same technique the whole way

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.380 
repeat the same technique the whole way
down<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> chain<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:05.909> again<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
down the chain and then again with the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.760 
down the chain and then again with the
other<00:01:06.510> ribbon<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:07.350> simple<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
other ribbon really simple we're just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
other ribbon really simple we're just
looping<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.610> through<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> chains

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
looping it in and out through the chains

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
looping it in and out through the chains
now<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.130> piece<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
now I'm gonna go through this piece of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.139 
now I'm gonna go through this piece of
chain

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.319 

go<00:01:19.149> up<00:01:19.299> through<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:19.570> side<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:22.030> go<00:01:22.149> down

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
go up through this side and then go down

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:34.020 
go up through this side and then go down
through<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.630> other<00:01:22.719> side

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.860 

when<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.300> bottom<00:01:35.540> end<00:01:35.660> of<00:01:35.750> your<00:01:35.810> chain

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
when you to the bottom end of your chain

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.690 
when you to the bottom end of your chain
repeat<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.590> exact<00:01:36.980> same<00:01:37.070> steps<00:01:37.370> that<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:37.670> did

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
the beginning with the two knots on each

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.710 
the beginning with the two knots on each
individual<00:01:39.920> chain<00:01:46.150> we've<00:01:47.150> done<00:01:47.300> one<00:01:47.510> full

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
individual chain we've done one full

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.120 
individual chain we've done one full
side<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:47.990> ribbon<00:01:48.410> now<00:01:48.590> we're<00:01:48.740> gonna<00:01:48.830> repeat

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
side of ribbon now we're gonna repeat

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.430 
side of ribbon now we're gonna repeat
the<00:01:49.280> exact<00:01:49.700> same<00:01:49.910> thing<00:01:50.270> using<00:01:50.900> our<00:01:51.110> second

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
the exact same thing using our second

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.320 
the exact same thing using our second
piece<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.710> ribbon<00:01:51.860> starting<00:01:52.729> with<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.150> knot

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
piece of ribbon starting with the knot

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:08.580 
piece of ribbon starting with the knot
at<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.570> top

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.020 

so<00:02:09.099> when<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.250> get<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.520> end<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.789> chain

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
so when you get to the end of the chain

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.880 
so when you get to the end of the chain
tie<00:02:10.390> two<00:02:10.450> knots<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:11.110> we<00:02:11.230> did<00:02:11.349> before<00:02:11.440> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
tie two knots like we did before and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.010 
tie two knots like we did before and
you're<00:02:12.250> done<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.670> officially<00:02:13.599> done<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:13.810> our
