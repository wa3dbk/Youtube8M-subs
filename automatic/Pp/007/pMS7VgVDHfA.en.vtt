00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
are looking at a map that I've developed

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.580 
are looking at a map that I've developed

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
so we will start up here we have a

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.330 
so we will start up here we have a
portal<00:00:48.460> next<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.970> house<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.739> have<00:00:51.040> our

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
portal next to the house we have our

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.100 
portal next to the house we have our
beautiful<00:00:51.780> garden<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:53.170> crops<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.930> is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
beautiful garden of crops and this is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.340 
beautiful garden of crops and this is
actually<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:57.750> deciduous<00:00:58.750> forest<00:01:00.809> biome<00:01:01.809> and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
actually the deciduous forest biome and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.560 
actually the deciduous forest biome and
if<00:01:03.129> you<00:01:03.220> don't<00:01:03.400> have<00:01:03.519> extra<00:01:03.760> biomes<00:01:04.000> installed

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
if you don't have extra biomes installed

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.100 
if you don't have extra biomes installed
then<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.170> will<00:01:05.350> just<00:01:05.650> kind<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.340> create<00:01:06.700> itself

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
then it will just kind of create itself

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.240 
then it will just kind of create itself
in<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.200> slightly<00:01:08.470> different<00:01:08.590> format<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.290> this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
in a slightly different format so this

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.640 
in a slightly different format so this
is<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.909> kennels<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.720> just<00:01:13.960> built<00:01:14.140> an<00:01:14.350> extra

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
is the kennels I just built an extra

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.530 
is the kennels I just built an extra

whichever you please so they are all for

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.140 
whichever you please so they are all for
some<00:01:20.890> odd<00:01:21.040> reason<00:01:21.070> staring<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.790> opposite

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
some odd reason staring in the opposite

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.649 
some odd reason staring in the opposite
direction<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:24.640> have<00:01:24.790> our<00:01:24.909> house<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.510> our

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
direction we have our house and our

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.179 
direction we have our house and our
stable<00:01:26.170> will<00:01:26.350> leave<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> house<00:01:26.830> for<00:01:27.130> last<00:01:29.189> so

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
stable will leave the house for last so

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.210 
stable will leave the house for last so
here<00:01:30.400> is<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.760> stable<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:32.619> stable<00:01:33.040> has<00:01:33.189> a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
here is the stable and this stable has a

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.789 
here is the stable and this stable has a
different<00:01:33.610> stall<00:01:33.850> design<00:01:34.299> than<00:01:34.689> previous<00:01:35.409> in

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
different stall design than previous in

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.969 
different stall design than previous in
the<00:01:36.219> simply<00:01:36.549> horses<00:01:36.729> map<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.439> one<00:01:38.619> simply

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
the simply horses map so this one simply

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.870 
the simply horses map so this one simply
just<00:01:39.130> has<00:01:39.310> an<00:01:39.520> overhead<00:01:40.350> overhead<00:01:41.350> rail<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
just has an overhead overhead rail and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.800 
just has an overhead overhead rail and
then<00:01:43.479> we<00:01:43.689> have<00:01:43.929> all<00:01:44.229> our<00:01:44.259> little<00:01:45.570> horsies<00:01:46.570> now

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810

working on breeding just the breathable
horses<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.729> not<00:01:51.820> worrying<00:01:52.149> about<00:01:52.359> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
horses and not worrying about the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.060 
horses and not worrying about the
fantasy<00:01:53.350> or<00:01:53.740> rare<00:01:54.039> horses<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.359> we<00:01:55.479> have<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.659> few

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
fantasy or rare horses so we have a few

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.440

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
then if keep walking through the barn

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.899 
then if keep walking through the barn
you<00:01:58.689> get<00:01:58.929> to<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.170> indoor<00:01:59.560> arena<00:01:59.920> which<00:02:00.670> has

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
you get to the indoor arena which has

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.899 
you get to the indoor arena which has
been<00:02:01.119> graciously<00:02:01.659> lit<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:03.369> has<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.549> few

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
been graciously lit and it has a few

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.370 
been graciously lit and it has a few
jumps<00:02:04.179> and<00:02:04.509> if<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.689> actually<00:02:04.840> take<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.259> mo

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
jumps and if you actually take the mo

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.899 
jumps and if you actually take the mo
creatures<00:02:05.679> horses<00:02:06.069> or<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.429> simply<00:02:06.729> horses

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
creatures horses or the simply horses

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.029 
creatures horses or the simply horses
you<00:02:07.630> can<00:02:07.810> actually<00:02:08.200> jump<00:02:08.410> over<00:02:08.619> these<00:02:08.770> but

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
you can actually jump over these but

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.830 
you can actually jump over these but
obviously<00:02:09.429> they're<00:02:09.670> fences<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.450> cannot

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
obviously they're fences so I cannot

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.290 
obviously they're fences so I cannot
jump<00:02:11.080> over<00:02:11.380> them<00:02:11.530> with<00:02:12.460> just<00:02:12.700> my<00:02:12.819> character

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
jump over them with just my character

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.840 
jump over them with just my character
and<00:02:13.830> there's<00:02:14.830> an<00:02:14.950> extra<00:02:15.190> little<00:02:15.310> room<00:02:15.610> back

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
and there's an extra little room back

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.370 
and there's an extra little room back
here<00:02:15.880> I've<00:02:16.330> been<00:02:16.480> using<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.870> as<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> breeding

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
here I've been using it as a breeding

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.710 
here I've been using it as a breeding
pen<00:02:17.770> but<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.400> use<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.580> as<00:02:18.970> anything<00:02:19.390> you

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.100 
pen but you can use it as anything you
want<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.160> we're<00:02:27.460> just<00:02:27.490> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.060> exit<00:02:28.840> back

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
want so we're just going to exit back

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.180 
want so we're just going to exit back
out<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.750> got<00:02:32.050> some<00:02:32.170> storage<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.709> either<00:02:32.800> side

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
out we got some storage on either side

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.380 
out we got some storage on either side
here<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.130> then<00:02:36.310> over<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.209> our
