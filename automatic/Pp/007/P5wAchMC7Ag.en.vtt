00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello in this video tutorial i will show how 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.380
 braid such a braid with a ribbon 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.440
 it is perfect for every day 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 how it trails very easily and quickly for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.490
 all you need is any 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.490
 tape of your choice 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.910
 collecting hair in the tail from the side 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.910
 secure the tape at the base of the tail 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.610
 Now divide the hair into two equal 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.890
 strands tape will be 3 strands in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.379
 weaving 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.520
 now we begin to weave an ordinary braid 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 of 3 strands weave just like us 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.840
 would weave a classic 3-strand braid 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:03.359
 as I said tape is here 3 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 strand braid such as braid and can 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:15.299
 garden as you like more weave so 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.500
 we fix the weave to the very end 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 hair elastics 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.750
 Now let's add the volume of the box office stretching 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.750
 strands 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.189
 and if you have medium length hair that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.219
 tape 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.770
 fix at the base of the tail so that 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.770
 it consisted of two equal halves 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.020
 we also divide hair into two equal strands and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.470
 we begin to weave an ordinary braid of 3 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.439
 strand ribbon 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:12.900
 consisting of two equal parts will 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:14.880
 appear 3 strands in weaving weave exactly 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.650
 just as we would weave 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.650
 3-strand classic braid 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.170
 finish weaving fix cash 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.170
 rezinochkoy 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.560
 Now let's add also the volume of the box office 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.060
 such a spit may look like 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.400
 it differently it all depends on 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.549
 how much volume will you transfer 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.549
 here and I stretched a strand and a little more 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.439
 smaller here 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.820
 that's all I hope you saw it 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.900
 liked it thanks for watching and before 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.530
 next time 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.530
 until
