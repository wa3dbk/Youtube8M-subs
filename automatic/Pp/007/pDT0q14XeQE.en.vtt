video I'm going to explain the

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.100 
video I'm going to explain the
importance<00:00:20.320> of<00:00:20.590> highway<00:00:21.520> miles<00:00:21.850> versus<00:00:22.810> city

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
importance of highway miles versus city

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.830 
importance of highway miles versus city
miles<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:24.580> another<00:00:24.940> video<00:00:25.240> I<00:00:25.540> talked<00:00:25.810> about

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
miles in another video I talked about

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.159 
miles in another video I talked about
the<00:00:26.200> 7<00:00:26.950> most<00:00:27.130> important<00:00:27.910> criteria<00:00:28.600> of<00:00:28.869> buying

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
the 7 most important criteria of buying

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.130 
the 7 most important criteria of buying
a<00:00:29.290> high-quality<00:00:29.500> used<00:00:30.130> car<00:00:30.480> highway<00:00:31.480> miles<00:00:31.779> is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
a high-quality used car highway miles is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.340 
a high-quality used car highway miles is
number<00:00:32.529> 2<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:33.010> list<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:34.660> people<00:00:35.080> shop

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
number 2 in that list when people shop

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.640 
number 2 in that list when people shop
for<00:00:35.410> cars<00:00:35.950> they're<00:00:36.610> usually<00:00:36.850> looking<00:00:37.390> at<00:00:37.870> low

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
for cars they're usually looking at low

for cars they're usually looking at low
mileage<00:00:39.160> cars<00:00:39.490> as<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.329> most<00:00:40.540> important<00:00:41.079> thing

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
mileage cars as the most important thing

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.940 
mileage cars as the most important thing
in<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.530> process<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:43.510> reply<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.620> that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
in that process my reply to that is that

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.910 
in that process my reply to that is that
it<00:00:45.100> is<00:00:45.250> not<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.940> amount<00:00:46.360> of<00:00:46.540> miles<00:00:46.900> that<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.440> so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
it is not the amount of miles that is so

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.840 
it is not the amount of miles that is so
important<00:00:48.460> as<00:00:48.610> it<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.690> type<00:00:49.990> of<00:00:50.020> miles<00:00:50.850> let

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
important as it is the type of miles let

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.560 
important as it is the type of miles let
me<00:00:51.970> explain

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
me explain

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.980

more<00:01:20.380> quickly<00:01:20.439> than<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.369> highway<00:01:21.640> driven<00:01:22.090> car

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
of those are going to see a much higher

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.859 
of those are going to see a much higher
degree<00:01:32.799> of<00:01:33.039> usage<00:01:33.520> than<00:01:33.819> in<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.119> highway<00:01:34.390> driven

quickly if you look at the interior of a

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.809 
quickly if you look at the interior of a
car<00:01:40.740> what's<00:01:41.740> happening<00:01:42.219> there<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.670> you're
