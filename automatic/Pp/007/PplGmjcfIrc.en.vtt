 for life that I can satisfy the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.320
 population such as the recommend I 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.520
 believe that the ideology of the president of the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.780
 republic to the inhabitants the sea the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.200
 youth of the democratic republic 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.120

 finally that we can defend 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.210
 vital interests of the nation 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.800
 I think my concern is 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.990
 that one does not convince is still in 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.470
 danger fragile democracy 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:04.620
 we present you there with a course 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:09.910
 rather classical studies a job 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.860
 show business then healthy politics 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.190
 journey fraught with pitfalls all one 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.260
 normal course of an ambitious Congolese 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.630
 I think it's a normal course 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.880
 from one like the ambitious ones like the 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.170
 most young Congolese I have 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.890
 says today that Europe is not 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.650
 Eldorado 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.690
 I dreamed I dreamed phenomenon me tillie 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.610
 as it has been called to some 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.350
 time and I followed that wind this 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.270
 movement and I left like so 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.520
 others I found that it was not 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.330
 the eldorado and that is my life it was here 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.090
 and I came back and I think here I 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.470
 do my life I believe everyone with 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.720
 courage and bravery 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.490
 we can face the realities of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.250
 our country and be able to change our country 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.660
 since paris new york washington did 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.550
 not consulted in a day 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.710
 I think it's the effort of 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.880
 American English people who 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.440
 contributed who did that 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.670
 today we can talk about these 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.070
 country there and we have to make an effort 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.200
 also here at home to change 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.390
 things and I believe that a very very 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.890
 good will is strong love of the 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.190
 homeland and we can change the 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.110
 things 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.110
 we're going right now that's fine 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 Yes
