out<00:01:51.880> those<00:01:52.000> triceps<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.540> get<00:01:52.689> more<00:01:52.930> range<00:01:53.200> of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
out those triceps to get more range of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.370 
out those triceps to get more range of
motion<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.040> work<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.399> more<00:01:54.670> triceps<00:01:55.149> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
motion so I can work on more triceps is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.999 
motion so I can work on more triceps is
I<00:01:56.380> come<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:58.420> from<00:01:58.450> here<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
I come to here and then from here that

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.749 
I come to here and then from here that
extra<00:02:00.430> stretch<00:02:01.140> back<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.740> then<00:02:03.670> I

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
extra stretch back to here and then I

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.429 
extra stretch back to here and then I
come<00:02:03.970> up<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:04.689> going<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.049> show<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.229> that

again come down above your head go and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.630 
again come down above your head go and
get<00:02:09.819> that<00:02:09.849> stretch<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:11.110> then<00:02:11.950> one<00:02:12.400> movement

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
get that stretch and then one movement

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.580 
get that stretch and then one movement
back<00:02:13.150> up<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.019> almost<00:02:14.140> like<00:02:14.319> two

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
Moe and even though the weights not very

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.150 
Moe and even though the weights not very
heavy<00:02:56.570> but<00:02:56.870> when<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.650> get<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:57.920> full<00:02:58.130> range

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
heavy but when you get that full range

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.280 
heavy but when you get that full range
like<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.060> really<00:02:59.600> really<00:02:59.810> works<00:03:00.140> your

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
triceps so you want to go ahead and do a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.320 
triceps so you want to go ahead and do a
superset<00:03:05.570> between<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.200> school<00:03:06.410> crushers<00:03:06.800> and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
superset between the school crushers and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.040 
superset between the school crushers and
this<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.370> pretty<00:03:13.730> basic<00:03:13.850> get<00:03:14.630> on<00:03:14.750> here

a lot of guys like to go all the way

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.680 
a lot of guys like to go all the way
down<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:18.560> where<00:03:18.740> their<00:03:19.220> their<00:03:19.670> elbows<00:03:20.240> are<00:03:20.510> way

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
down to where their their elbows are way

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.770 
down to where their their elbows are way
beyond<00:03:21.020> 90<00:03:21.760> personally<00:03:22.760> for<00:03:22.940> me<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.630> lot

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
beyond 90 personally for me it's a lot

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.770 
beyond 90 personally for me it's a lot
of<00:03:23.810> stress<00:03:24.110> on<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:25.160> shoulders<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:26.210> I<00:03:26.570> feel

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
of stress on my shoulders and I feel

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.480 
of stress on my shoulders and I feel
some<00:03:26.960> stress<00:03:27.050> year<00:03:27.440> old<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.710> the<00:03:27.830> elbows<00:03:28.100> also

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
some stress year old on the elbows also

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.610 
some stress year old on the elbows also
so<00:03:29.150> personally<00:03:29.510> for<00:03:29.630> me<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> go<00:03:30.080> about<00:03:30.230> ninety

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
so personally for me I go about ninety

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.530 
so personally for me I go about ninety
degrees<00:03:30.650> up<00:03:31.490> to<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.850> if<00:03:32.090> you're<00:03:32.300> really

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
degrees up to you if you're really

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.390 
degrees up to you if you're really
really<00:03:32.690> flexible<00:03:33.020> you<00:03:33.710> come<00:03:33.980> down<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.220> little

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
really flexible you come down a little

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.960 
really flexible you come down a little
more<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:35.630> would<00:03:36.320> probably<00:03:36.680> recommend<00:03:36.970> even

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
more I would probably recommend even

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.120 
more I would probably recommend even
though<00:03:38.210> a<00:03:38.540> full<00:03:39.140> range<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.500> motion<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:39.950> good

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
though a full range of motion is good

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.670 
though a full range of motion is good
but<00:03:41.030> when<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.390> comes<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.840> like<00:03:42.050> dips<00:03:42.350> you

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
but when it comes to like dips you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.380 
but when it comes to like dips you
probably<00:03:43.040> want<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.250> stand<00:03:43.520> about<00:03:43.700> 90<00:03:44.090> just<00:03:44.300> to

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
probably want to stand about 90 just to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.870 
probably want to stand about 90 just to
be<00:03:44.510> safe<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:45.050> we<00:03:45.290> do<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.740> and<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.340> doesn't<00:03:46.580> hurt

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
be safe if we do it and it doesn't hurt

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.000 
be safe if we do it and it doesn't hurt
right<00:03:47.030> now<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.330> can't<00:03:47.750> do<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.650> probably

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
right now you can't do it is probably

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.790 
right now you can't do it is probably
only<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.520> matter<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.880> time<00:03:49.970> before<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:51.410> starts

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
only a matter of time before it starts

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.200 
only a matter of time before it starts
suffer<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.280> you're<00:03:52.370> going<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.580> have<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.850> limit

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
suffer and you're going to have to limit

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.030 
suffer and you're going to have to limit
your<00:03:53.330> range<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.630> motion<00:03:53.690> anyways<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.470> then

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
your range of motion anyways and then

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.460 
your range of motion anyways and then
when<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.310> do<00:03:55.490> you're<00:03:55.910> also<00:03:56.230> little<00:03:57.230> injured

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
when you do you're also little injured

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.940 
when you do you're also little injured
so<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:59.060> want<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.270> be<00:03:59.330> safe<00:03:59.770> let's<00:04:00.770> stick<00:04:00.920> with

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
so you want to be safe let's stick with

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.830 
so you want to be safe let's stick with
about<00:04:01.220> 90<00:04:01.490> degrees<00:04:01.580> here<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.420> just<00:04:02.600> come<00:04:02.720> back

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
about 90 degrees here and just come back

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:15.909 
about 90 degrees here and just come back
up<00:04:02.950> just<00:04:03.950> like<00:04:04.070> that

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919

ideally for me I like to grab about six
inches<00:05:18.730> apart<00:05:18.880> some<00:05:19.810> people<00:05:20.140> like<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.350> go<00:05:20.590> a

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
inches apart some people like to go a

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.760 
inches apart some people like to go a
little<00:05:20.830> closer<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:22.300> closer<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:23.170> is<00:05:23.230> the<00:05:23.650> more

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
little closer the closer it is the more

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.830 
little closer the closer it is the more
tricep<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.580> works<00:05:24.790> but<00:05:25.180> at<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.420> same<00:05:25.600> time

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
tricep that works but at the same time

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.670 
tricep that works but at the same time
the<00:05:26.200> more<00:05:26.350> pressure<00:05:26.620> on<00:05:26.800> your<00:05:26.890> wrist<00:05:27.190> so

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
the more pressure on your wrist so

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.230 
the more pressure on your wrist so
ideally<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.710> would<00:05:29.950> say<00:05:30.130> if<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.580> have<00:05:30.610> we

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
ideally I would say if you have we

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.940 
ideally I would say if you have we
Chris's<00:05:31.750> or<00:05:31.990> if<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.350> doesn't<00:05:32.620> really<00:05:32.710> feel

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
Chris's or if it doesn't really feel

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.160 
Chris's or if it doesn't really feel
right<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.940> farthest<00:05:34.420> out<00:05:34.570> you<00:05:34.780> want<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.050> go

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
right the farthest out you want to go

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.630 
right the farthest out you want to go
before<00:05:35.380> you<00:05:35.680> start<00:05:35.920> working<00:05:36.100> too<00:05:36.310> much<00:05:36.490> on

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
before you start working too much on

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.450 
before you start working too much on
your<00:05:36.790> chest<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.390> is<00:05:38.050> probably<00:05:38.590> about<00:05:38.830> 12

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
your chest it is probably about 12

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.420 
your chest it is probably about 12
inches<00:05:39.790> so<00:05:40.260> 12<00:05:41.260> inches<00:05:41.530> is<00:05:41.650> about<00:05:41.770> right<00:05:42.100> here

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
inches so 12 inches is about right here

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.370 
inches so 12 inches is about right here
if<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:42.820> go<00:05:43.000> any<00:05:43.210> more<00:05:43.480> than<00:05:43.630> 12<00:05:43.840> inches<00:05:43.990> it's

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
if you go any more than 12 inches it's

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.870 
if you go any more than 12 inches it's
almost<00:05:44.620> like<00:05:44.770> a<00:05:44.830> regular<00:05:44.980> bench<00:05:45.280> press<00:05:45.550> and

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
almost like a regular bench press and

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.460 
almost like a regular bench press and
even<00:05:46.570> though<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.750> will<00:05:46.960> work<00:05:47.170> your<00:05:47.320> triceps

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
even though you will work your triceps

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.290 
even though you will work your triceps
it's<00:05:48.310> going<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.520> work<00:05:48.670> too<00:05:48.850> much<00:05:48.970> of<00:05:49.180> your

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
it's going to work too much of your

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.270 
it's going to work too much of your
chest<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.260> may<00:05:50.470> want<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.740> go<00:05:50.860> ahead<00:05:50.950> and<00:05:51.160> do

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.640 

all<00:06:31.250> right<00:06:31.430> so<00:06:31.870> close<00:06:32.870> court<00:06:33.110> bench<00:06:33.289> you<00:06:33.500> want

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
all right so close court bench you want

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.310 
all right so close court bench you want
to<00:06:33.710> do<00:06:33.770> about<00:06:33.889> four<00:06:34.280> sets<00:06:34.610> in<00:06:35.449> about<00:06:35.750> eight<00:06:36.020> to

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
to do about four sets in about eight to

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.159 
to do about four sets in about eight to
ten<00:06:36.530> repetition<00:06:37.150> so<00:06:38.150> that's<00:06:38.600> a<00:06:38.720> little<00:06:38.960> light

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
ten repetition so that's a little light

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.480 
ten repetition so that's a little light
for<00:06:39.380> me<00:06:39.500> so<00:06:39.680> I<00:06:39.710> probably<00:06:39.979> have<00:06:40.160> to<00:06:40.250> go<00:06:40.340> up<00:06:40.430> a

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
for me so I probably have to go up a

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.279 
for me so I probably have to go up a
little<00:06:40.520> more<00:06:40.729> wait<00:06:41.090> if<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:41.900> haven't<00:06:42.169> done<00:06:42.229> it

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
little more wait if you haven't done it

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.230 
little more wait if you haven't done it
before<00:06:42.440> test<00:06:43.160> it<00:06:43.310> out<00:06:43.400> always<00:06:43.729> start<00:06:44.120> off

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
before test it out always start off

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.510 
before test it out always start off
light<00:06:44.539> work<00:06:45.320> your<00:06:45.500> way<00:06:45.650> up<00:06:45.680> in<00:06:46.009> a<00:06:46.070> pyramid<00:06:46.490> of

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.909 
light work your way up in a pyramid of
weights<00:06:46.820> until<00:06:47.509> you<00:06:47.690> find<00:06:47.930> a<00:06:48.020> way<00:06:48.169> that<00:06:48.800> you

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
weights until you find a way that you

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.680 
weights until you find a way that you
can<00:06:49.070> do<00:06:49.190> comfortably<00:06:49.699> about<00:06:50.060> eight<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.509> ten

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
can do comfortably about eight to ten

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.779 
can do comfortably about eight to ten
reps<00:06:50.919> especially<00:06:51.919> if<00:06:52.009> you<00:06:52.070> don't<00:06:52.250> have<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:52.430> spot
