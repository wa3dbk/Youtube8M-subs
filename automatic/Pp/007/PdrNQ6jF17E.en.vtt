00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
know my philosophy is you cannot win a

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.800 
know my philosophy is you cannot win a
game<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.580> give<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.939> other<00:01:59.090> team<00:01:59.360> free<00:01:59.630> run

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
game if you give the other team free run

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.809 
game if you give the other team free run
of<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.110> map<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.770> just<00:02:00.979> does<00:02:01.280> not<00:02:01.490> work<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
of the map it just does not work that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.940 
of the map it just does not work that
way<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:02.209> have<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.689> restrict<00:02:03.080> areas<00:02:03.590> sit<00:02:03.920> down

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
way you have to restrict areas sit down

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.919 
way you have to restrict areas sit down
and<00:02:04.490> stop<00:02:04.700> moving<00:02:05.030> around<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.539> much<00:02:05.599> sometimes

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.030 
but obviously that didn't work he runs
right<00:03:25.820> by<00:03:26.060> my<00:03:26.180> brother<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:27.800> get<00:03:27.950> him

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
right by my brother and we we get him

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.920 
right by my brother and we we get him
taken<00:03:28.190> out<00:03:28.400> anyway<00:03:28.580> but<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.690> just<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
taken out anyway but it is just the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.560 
taken out anyway but it is just the
principle<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:31.130> thing<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.730> right<00:03:32.390> now

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
principle of the thing here right now

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.530 
principle of the thing here right now

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.320 
three so and my team is losing with not
about<00:05:07.199> twelve<00:05:07.530> twelve<00:05:08.460> hundred<00:05:08.699> points<00:05:09.030> here

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
about twelve twelve hundred points here

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.900 
about twelve twelve hundred points here
so<00:05:09.479> there's<00:05:09.660> 12<00:05:09.870> kills<00:05:10.229> and<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:11.310> I'm<00:05:11.639> really

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
so there's 12 kills and and I'm really

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.180 
so there's 12 kills and and I'm really
just<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.570> trying<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.199> trying<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.860> work<00:05:14.039> it

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
just just trying to trying to work it

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.249 
just just trying to trying to work it
out<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.460> see<00:05:14.610> what<00:05:14.759> we<00:05:14.820> can<00:05:14.940> do<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.360> figured

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
out and see what we can do I figured

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.870 
out and see what we can do I figured
there's<00:05:16.889> no<00:05:16.979> need<00:05:17.250> for<00:05:17.280> me<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.490> run<00:05:17.699> out

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
there's no need for me to run out

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.700 
there's no need for me to run out
because<00:05:18.270> I've<00:05:18.570> run<00:05:18.810> out<00:05:18.930> two<00:05:19.229> or<00:05:19.259> three<00:05:19.530> times

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
because I've run out two or three times

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.920 
because I've run out two or three times
of<00:05:19.979> you<00:05:20.070> as<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.460> all<00:05:20.610> have<00:05:20.820> seen<00:05:21.120> earlier<00:05:21.389> and

of you as you all have seen earlier and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.230 
of you as you all have seen earlier and
and<00:05:22.530> that's<00:05:22.830> gotten<00:05:23.340> me<00:05:23.370> nothing<00:05:23.820> except

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
and that's gotten me nothing except

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.499 
and that's gotten me nothing except
killed<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.349> I'm<00:05:25.560> really<00:05:26.460> really<00:05:27.240> what<00:05:27.419> I'm
