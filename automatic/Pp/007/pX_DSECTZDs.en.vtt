for<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> price<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.829> pretty<00:01:53.220> pricey<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
drugstore makeup product but when you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.800

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
consider the fact that you have five

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.700 
consider the fact that you have five
eyes<00:02:01.500> shadows<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:03.270> kind<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.140> bronzer

really<00:02:11.239> worth<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.750> money<00:02:11.959> that's<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.680> review
