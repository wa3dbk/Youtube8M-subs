00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 tells crowd to see one we have here to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.590
 Another videotape by Professor Julio and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.429
 today we will review the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 cytoplasm of the cell that same topic that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.640
 falls a lot in the tests and the time has come 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 to retrieve information that has already 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.859
 are there asleep inside your 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.980
 brain starts talking about the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 yellow plasma that same liquid 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.130
 that we have inside the cytoplasm where 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
 the cytoplasmic organelles are 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.100
 distributes is the medium that supports 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.129
 so that chemical reactions within the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 cytoplasm can happen of course there 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.430
 water and remember to water the solvent 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.039
 which is where the largest 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 of the chemical reactions within the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.340
 living beings 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.640
 aije the bath in which I have to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.910
 remember kohl cytoplasm we have to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 speak of the organized cytoplasm 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 beginning with the one found in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.310
 all the cells of all living things 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.700
 of the earth that are the ribosomes that have 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.600
 main function is the production of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.060
 the famous protein synthesis 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.060
 forget that the single we are does not have 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.640
 lipoprotein composition it is not a 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.509
 organelle membrane pink actually it is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.329
 made from proteins and rn to ribosome 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.420
 Do not forget that we 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.590
 we have the approximate reticle smash 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.070
 nuclear membrane 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.759
 we have the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.340
 or is spent plasma or granular having 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.600
 main function is the production of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.610
 the production of enzymes and the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.540
 transport of substances within the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.880
 cells 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.829
 already his friend who is also stuck 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.380
 in it but a little further from the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.090
 nucleus is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.829
 or the granulate also has the function 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.850
 transport of substances but how it is 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.730
 smooth it has no goal we are google 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.040
 ribosomes adhered to its wall already 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.340
 is smooth because it has no 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.280
 ribosomes attached to his wall he has 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.740
 main function is the production of 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.050
 but do not forget that it is in the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.140
 smooth endoplasmic reticulum that we 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.760
 we have the breakdown of toxic substances and 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.400
 I really am 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.230
 aiai and now one that probably 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.750
 only name you will remember from here 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.930
 fifteen years after you do not study 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.750
 more biology the famous mitochondria 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.060
 they tend to own it so they 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.610
 can not reproduce 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.580
 reproduce but they can divide 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.130
 is independently of sel 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.500
 mitochondria has a kind of will of its own 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.470
 to produce several other mitochondria and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.160
 is where the cellular respiration occurs to 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.090
 energy production for the production of 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.910
 atp 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.580
 remember that mitochondria are not 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.400
 found in procaryotic or 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.070
 be those cells that do not have a 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.590
 Nuclear cell membrane bacteria 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.020
 kingdom cells monera now both are 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.380
 speak of plant as if the animal possesses 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.960
 mitochondria for atp production and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.170
 golgi complex in golgi complex 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.540
 also do not have prokaryotic cells in 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.910
 are found both in animal cells 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.970
 as in plant cells 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.310
 its main function is the function of the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.710
 complex of secretion goals is a 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.440
 Packer he picks up proteins 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.050
 manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.520
 I enjoy and packs to be able to secretary 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.160
 This out of the cell. 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.500
 remember that secretion and excretion do not 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.380
 are the same thing registration is when I 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.900
 send 'em out something bad secretion is 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.750
 When I send out something that will be 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.360
 used by our organism 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.190
 furthermore the golgi complex is 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.860
 responsible for the synthesis of 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.590
 polysaccharides for example the manufacture 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.050
 of sugar glycogen very large 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.370
 serves as a reserve of energy in 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.790
 animal cells 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.060
 already the center or large centers sinhos 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.760
 they are not 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.730
 found in procare optical rooms are 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.610
 cells and in animals and 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.190
 only occasionally they are found in the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.430
 plant cells of gibbon from time to time 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.430
 when when heterodox biota you have 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.500
 between luge in the leg angels sperm not 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.889
 It's 108 for clear 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.600
 remember that the centers are 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.230
 involved in the formation of eyelashes and 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.930
 of cells and in addition and are 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.470
 responsible for the formation of 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.080
 which are extremely important 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.479
 for the process of cell division to 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.260
 that both mitosis and 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.600
 meiosis 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.810
 lysosomes that have the function of 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.330
 the main cellular digestion of 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.820
 everything that the cell engulfs everything 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.490
 plaguing that picks and places for 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.430
 inside it is not found in cells 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.460
 look for optics is found in cells 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.680
 animals but are also not found 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.130
 in plant cells in the cells 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.840
 vegetables who does a middle function 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.780
 similar to lysosomes are the 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.410
 shacks that have in the cytoplasm of these 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.870
 cells 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.590
 and do not forget that the father in the lysosomes 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.710
 is the golgi complex ie the 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.330
 lysosomes are formed by the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.330
 goal complex 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.490
 and since I said in a vacuum, let's talk one 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.389
 little more he is the boats of the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.470
 plant cells or spaces that we 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.100
 inside the cytoplasm where it has the 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.080
 background as the main function of the control 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.510
 of this plant cell, ie the 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.950
 control of water inlet and outlet 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.370
 inside the bread cell I stayed here 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.680
 speaking of plastic clergy have not forgotten the 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.260
 chloroplast not present in cells 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.260
 do not forget that the function of the 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.050
 chloroplast is to take photosynthesis and 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.669
 The truth is that photosynthesis does not 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.550
 to produce atp 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.460
 it serves to produce compound sugar 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.370
 produced thereafter 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.040
 goes to the laneve cellular respiration 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:39.120
 konder it will all be broken that sugar 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.880
 for you there yes we have the production of atp 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.010
 energy production, do not forget that 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.340
 within the chloroplast has chlorophyll that 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.470
 is the pigment that absorbs strong energy 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.810
 that the light energy to transform 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.310
 use this energy to form sugar 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.960
 but do not forget that there is another 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.790
 because the chloroplast is 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.540
 classified as a type of chromium 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.650
 plastic but we also have the 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.960
 leukoplast those who have as function 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.750
 in plant cells. 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.180
 Storage of anhydrous gave to remember 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.289
 of things inside the cytoplasm if 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.760
 did not look for our video lessons 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:18.889
 for secondary education in order to 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.889
 who waited for everything on our site 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.870
 www.bioenergia.net.br or even in the 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.350
 Youtube you have lots of video lesson for 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.660
 help you achieve your goal 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:36.110
 no more a great pleasure to have you here 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.110
 Once again, a big hug, bye. 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.570
 miss
