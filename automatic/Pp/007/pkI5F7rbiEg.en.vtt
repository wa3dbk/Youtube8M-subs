00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
decided to make an unmarked and thinking

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.840 
decided to make an unmarked and thinking
that<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.160> well<00:00:32.279> so

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
that you would like this one as well so

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060 
that you would like this one as well so
basically<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.450> thought<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.770> have

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
basically I thought that see I have

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.420 
basically I thought that see I have
frost<00:00:35.700> beast<00:00:35.940> over<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.469> thought<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
frost beast over here and I thought it's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.049

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a little bit too here and there so I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
a little bit too here and there so I
thought<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.719> could<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.469> bigger<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> better

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.720 
thought I could make a bigger and better
one<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.739> frosty<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
like one of those pieces here which we

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.949 
like one of those pieces here which we
can<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.010> slide<00:02:50.250> down<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.090> she<00:02:51.120> says<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
can just slide down so she says if you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020 
can just slide down so she says if you
try<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.440> bend<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.830> too<00:02:53.130> much<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.640> will<00:02:53.849> break
