00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.420
 hi friends, we are going here with a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.220
 planetary interaction guide on a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.160
 basic structure to produce 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.139
 materials of 2 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.389
 on a single planet without having to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.830
 export or import to that planet but 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.259
 first let's start with the basics 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.439
 that would be the skills needed to 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.230
 start with this planetary interaction 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.990
 that skills are these four that we see 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 here the comanche theroux great 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.000
 interplanetary consolidation 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.470
 planetology and remote sensing for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.420
 accounts that want to start doing 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.309
 planetary interaction and do not want 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.830
 spend a lot of time I would recommend a 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 level 4 structure on how to access 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.180
 greats level 4 in inter- Aryan plan and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.430
 consolidation and planetology and remote 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 scene to 3 this more or less I would spend 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.230
 about three days and means of skills that do not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.350
 it's a lot and with that you can already get 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.110
 money then obviously the optimum would be 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.540
 get these two to 5 and these 2 to 5 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.790
 as well 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.670
 but good to start that would be what 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.100
 basic 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.860
 another thing we would need we followed the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.420
 ravine keep these objects as 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.759
 occupy a thousand cubic meters 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 Well I would recommend that you use a ship 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.830
 of charge to power that has to be 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.750
 in the inventory of your ship to be able 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.030
 start the planetary interaction not 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.310
 it's okay if it's inside a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.960
 structure or that is out there saved 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.610
 somewhere that he detected to know is 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.869
 say you have to be in your ship your ship 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.979
 he has to have space to be able 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.439
 load it now what we are going to do is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.530
 I'm going to go to planet 3, which is the one 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.700
 selected to build 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.700
 and we are going to approach 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.040
 this is the view of our planet I 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.960
 game with the graphics lowered by that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.080
 it looks so bad but good you 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.690
 you will see much better and these are both 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.270
 bars that we have here the build and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 the scan first we're going to scan and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.160
 as we see these bars are fuller 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.440
 or less full depending on the quantity 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.290
 of resources that this planet has 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.940
 the more white then more resources 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 It also depends on the level of 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.850
 security in which we are this is a 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.520
 security level 0 0 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.050
 that's why there are some so high but for 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.200
 example if it was this in high set then 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.570
 most would be here or much less 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.090
 then we will begin to see what that 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.360
 we build 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.400
 one of the pages that I recommend is 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.960
 this plant is a very good page for 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.260
 build and to see what we want to be 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.020
 has in function of the planets so you 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.610
 says what components materials 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.830
 we can extract from them or if you can not 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.120
 go directly to schemes and say then 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.690
 let's see if I want to do 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.930
 coulant example of planets is to serve ya 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.390
 not if I want to do for example 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.550
 consumer electronics then what planets 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.110
 then it is very good because you say 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 with a plasma I could do both 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.190
 elements that is to say it would be worth me but with 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.180
 a gas could only make one and I do not 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.879
 would be worth so much then 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.950
 we have to see what we are going to 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.930
 build here what is it that we 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.370
 interesting and what do we need 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.370
 to for it 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.440
 and we are going to build mechanical parts a 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.350
 one of the parties and as we see in 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.260
 barrence we have nobel goals you see betas 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.880
 it works perfectly for us 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:35.230
 for our planet then what are 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.160
 we need these and these 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.790
 then now let's learn to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.530
 scan by default the bars you go to 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.840
 find this bar beneath 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.610
 here of scanned positioned and as you see 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.030
 well we do not understand much where 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.930
 There are the real mineral veins 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.810
 So what are we going to do? 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.910
 to reduce the size to the minimum to the minimum 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.060
 We are going to select the material that 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.900
 we want to search and we are going to move 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.460
 on the right 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.200
 this bar you see how they are going 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.840
 increasingly smaller until 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.780
 there are little white spots worth 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.590
 that there are only a few left to say that they are the 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.360
 more sites with more mineral and we're going to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.980
 do the same with the other mineral that 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.680
 let's extract 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.090
 new metals then as you see they do not see 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.010
 goals here has a little more good 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.010
 so what we have to look for are 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.830
 sites that have both a close 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.370
 material like another then let's look 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.129
 here it seems that there is one 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.379
 as you can see this is 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.779
 one on top of the other is to say it 's perfect 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.279
 for our construction because no 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.619
 we are going to have any kind of problem 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.939
 then let's start with the 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:47.830
 construction let's take our 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:50.379
 command center that we have in our 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.419
 hangar and we're going to put it there's no need 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.069
 I put it where you are going to build 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.959
 Exactly things you can put it 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.509
 him as a teacher where you want because I 

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:01.409
 I do not use it as a warehouse but what happens 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.069
 when you go into planet mode 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.959
 automatically the view is going to focus 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.029
 in him as decent is to say that he is 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:08.589
 near your structures is useful because 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.699
 so you do not have to look for your 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.670
 structures 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.610
 I'm going to place it for example over here 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.010
 and I'll do it to the maximum that leaves me 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.200
 in my skills, it's worth a bit of money 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.210
 we already have it and we have it 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.100
 what to take on, that is, we have to 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.780
 accept this step 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.420
 we already have our call center and how 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.820
 You see we have unlocked many more 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.290
 construction options as is going to be 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.690
 the structure that we're going to make a 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.040
 structure of two extractors four 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.990
 basic two advanced and a espai sport 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.810
 let's start building the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.450
 extractor as you see here we have our 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.500
 central point of extraction and the other 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.870
 he was also here very close 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.750
 then what we are going to do is going to be 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.980
 place it in such a way that the circle of 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.770
 light gray color is encompassing our 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.720
 our our ore to extract 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.920
 then we will place it for example 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.490
 by 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.490
 here 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.680
 and from there what we are going to do 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.680
 is to put a basic
