00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.529
 Alex guitar . ru and today we are with you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.519
 let's sort the oblique on an acoustic guitar and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.560
 bands beatles 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.560
 song is all 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.190
 this is the beatles first song 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.970
 which they played acoustic solos on 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.920
 guitar and it is on nylon 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.410
 this song broke the stereotype and which 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.059
 were regarding 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.180
 ate imagined that this is a group i 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.450
 damn more often on guitars singing e and here people 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 saw that they could play something 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.720
 more sincere more interesting and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.800
 today's straw just disassemble it 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.800
 very interesting in the original it is played 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.010
 half a tone lower that is, if you are 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.530
 want to play this song as it is 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.900
 It sounds in the original as its plays 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 George Harrison you need to lower 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.220
 construction Tories a semitone lower than I did 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.930
 I will not do it now if you want you 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.590
 can do it so what's 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 feature feature of this solo game 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.500
 will meet in it 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.630
 ascending and descending slides 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 what is the slide this here what is this 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.270
 upward slide downward slide and here 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.310
 such reception were to meet 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.590
 repeatedly in this solo and so let's with 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.230
 I'll start you play slowly 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.190
 him you will look at my hands and 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.010
 will look at the tablature 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.410
 at the beginning we play everything on the third string 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.410
 all on the third string and so 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.430
 slide 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.840

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.580
 slide 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.970
 and when we made him I still have to give 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.760
 make reception where brother that is this note 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.520
 shake is not interesting if it is just 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.750
 sounds exactly like much now 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:05.330
 more interesting when that sounds possible 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.330

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:28.170
