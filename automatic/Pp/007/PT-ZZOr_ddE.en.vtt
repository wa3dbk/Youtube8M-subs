of people are telling me that having a
hard<00:00:13.930> time<00:00:14.019> training<00:00:14.920> their<00:00:15.190> traps<00:00:15.490> and

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:15.789 
hard time training their traps and

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.420 
hard time training their traps and
getting<00:00:16.720> any<00:00:16.869> quality<00:00:17.770> development<00:00:18.010> from

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
getting any quality development from

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.130 
getting any quality development from
their<00:00:18.550> traps<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:19.180> I<00:00:19.359> wanted<00:00:19.600> to<00:00:19.689> do<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:19.869> little

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
their traps and I wanted to do a little

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.599 
their traps and I wanted to do a little
bit<00:00:20.260> of<00:00:20.320> an<00:00:20.410> experiment<00:00:20.800> with<00:00:21.220> you<00:00:21.340> right<00:00:21.580> now

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
bit of an experiment with you right now

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.730 
bit of an experiment with you right now
and<00:00:22.150> hopefully<00:00:22.330> that<00:00:22.689> experiment<00:00:23.320> will<00:00:23.470> shed

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
and hopefully that experiment will shed

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.500 
and hopefully that experiment will shed
some<00:00:23.950> light<00:00:23.980> on<00:00:24.460> how<00:00:24.880> you<00:00:25.000> really<00:00:25.240> should

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
some light on how you really should

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.439 
some light on how you really should
approach<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:26.140> exercise<00:00:26.650> anew<00:00:27.070> so<00:00:27.730> I<00:00:28.150> want<00:00:28.390> you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
okay now if you felt that little

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.750 
okay now if you felt that little
exercise<00:00:55.870> more<00:00:56.710> than<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.309> when<00:00:57.609> you're

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
exercise more than you do when you're

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.209 
exercise more than you do when you're
doing<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.120> set<00:00:58.389> in<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.659> gym<00:00:58.929> with<00:00:59.469> weights<00:00:59.769> it's

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
doing a set in the gym with weights it's

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.949 
doing a set in the gym with weights it's
a<00:01:00.370> telltale<00:01:00.819> sign<00:01:00.879> that<00:01:01.120> you're<00:01:01.479> using<00:01:01.659> too

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
a telltale sign that you're using too

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.660 
a telltale sign that you're using too
much<00:01:02.109> weight<00:01:02.379> if<00:01:02.649> you're<00:01:03.129> using<00:01:03.309> too<00:01:03.519> much

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
much weight if you're using too much

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.130 
much weight if you're using too much
weight<00:01:03.879> you're<00:01:04.059> probably<00:01:04.239> picking<00:01:04.839> up<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
weight you're probably picking up the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.380 
weight you're probably picking up the
energy<00:01:05.500> of<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.710> exercise<00:01:06.130> in<00:01:06.430> their<00:01:06.909> hands

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
energy of the exercise in their hands

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.200 
energy of the exercise in their hands
your<00:01:07.990> shoulders<00:01:08.590> your<00:01:09.280> lower<00:01:09.460> back<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:10.060> maybe

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
your shoulders your lower back and maybe

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.930 
your shoulders your lower back and maybe
even<00:01:10.330> your<00:01:10.750> core<00:01:11.049> and<00:01:11.290> even<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.650> your<00:01:11.740> legs<00:01:12.010> so

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
even your core and even in your legs so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.190 
even your core and even in your legs so
what<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.180> want<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.420> do<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.720> try<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:13.930> pick<00:01:14.170> a

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
what you want to do is try to pick a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900 
what you want to do is try to pick a
weight<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:14.770> can<00:01:14.920> actually<00:01:15.070> recreate

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
weight that you can actually recreate

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.760 
weight that you can actually recreate
the<00:01:16.090> sentence<00:01:16.420> same<00:01:16.780> sensation<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.620> got

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
the sentence same sensation that you got

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.230 
the sentence same sensation that you got
when<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.100> were<00:01:18.220> doing<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.610> exercise<00:01:19.030> without

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
when you were doing the exercise without

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.300 
when you were doing the exercise without
weights<00:01:19.660> and<00:01:19.960> that's<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.560> pretty<00:01:20.740> good<00:01:20.830> proxy

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
weights and that's a pretty good proxy

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.150 
weights and that's a pretty good proxy
for<00:01:21.580> any<00:01:22.150> other<00:01:22.390> exercise<00:01:22.930> as<00:01:23.140> well<00:01:23.170> if<00:01:23.740> you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
for any other exercise as well if you

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.080 
for any other exercise as well if you
can<00:01:24.280> feel<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.730> exercise<00:01:25.240> more<00:01:25.900> without<00:01:26.470> ways

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
can feel the exercise more without ways

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.160 
can feel the exercise more without ways
there's<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.210> good<00:01:28.390> chance<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.870> you're<00:01:28.990> using

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
there's a good chance that you're using

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.080 
there's a good chance that you're using
two<00:01:29.830> heavy<00:01:30.160> weights<00:01:30.460> when<00:01:30.760> you're<00:01:30.910> actually

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
two heavy weights when you're actually

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.240 
two heavy weights when you're actually
doing<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.540> exercise<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.260> gym<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:33.040> why

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
doing the exercise in the gym so why

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
doing the exercise in the gym so why
don't<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:33.400> try<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.670> do<00:01:33.880> this

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
don't you try to do this

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.560 
don't you try to do this
start<00:01:35.200> small<00:01:35.740> try<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.460> find<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.090> weight<00:01:37.390> that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
start small try to find a weight that

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.080 
start small try to find a weight that
you<00:01:37.630> can<00:01:37.750> still<00:01:38.260> feel<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.100> sensation<00:01:39.490> with

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
you can still feel that sensation with

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.880 
you can still feel that sensation with
and<00:01:40.270> then<00:01:40.630> work<00:01:40.840> your<00:01:40.870> way<00:01:41.080> up<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.440> stack<00:01:41.680> so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
and then work your way up the stack so

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.380 
and then work your way up the stack so
what<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.100> want<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.370> try<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.610> do<00:01:42.790> is<00:01:43.000> find<00:01:43.210> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
what you want to try to do is find the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.600 
what you want to try to do is find the
heaviest<00:01:43.600> weight<00:01:43.990> possible<00:01:44.260> without<00:01:45.040> losing

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
heaviest weight possible without losing

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.730 
heaviest weight possible without losing
the<00:01:45.730> sensation<00:01:46.360> once<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.020> sensation<00:01:47.590> goes

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
the sensation once the sensation goes

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.220 
the sensation once the sensation goes
away<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.310> will<00:01:48.730> be<00:01:48.880> able<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.150> see<00:01:49.570> that<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
away you will be able to see that the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.750 
away you will be able to see that the
weight<00:01:50.409> gets<00:01:50.650> transferred<00:01:51.159> from<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.460> area

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
weight gets transferred from the area

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.610 
weight gets transferred from the area
you<00:01:51.880> want<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.090> work<00:01:52.300> on<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.990> other<00:01:53.170> parts<00:01:53.409> of

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620
