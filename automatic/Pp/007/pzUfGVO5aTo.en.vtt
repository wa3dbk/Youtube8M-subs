00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.970
 Starek thinks I'm fit and today should be 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.600
 it is about favorites and for the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.600
 month of march 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.219
 hallelujah has long had no favorites 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.080
 More is done and it is time and me 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.880
 have some treasures but first want 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.970
 I thank you for stopping by 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.250
 the first video since just say so 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.110
 so many have commented 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.939
 have nice that you are back and 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.470
 I was not so aware that 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.480
 Maybe I will be so blurred 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 and that's just how I do the video 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 So I actually missed it 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.059
 nice to you that you are still there 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.860
 and have so diligently commented on and 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.510
 thumbs up is like the total number 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.280
 thumbs up, that makes me happy 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.049
 just totally that the feedback since so 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.100
 Well, that was why it was easy and fluffy 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.869
 Monats was probably a sweetheart I 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 rediscovered is the brad pitt 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:55.729
 a crash from mac and that a lot 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.790
 very nice everyday color I was a long time 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.409
 with this cream hat on war foot though 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.629
 meanwhile I find that easy 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.400
 wonderful works i have mine 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.500
 Technique my two finger technique 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.270
 I then develop that with ease 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.040
 on pots and you can do great 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.229
 Blend the color is very nice 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.369
 discreet and works very well if 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.020
 for example, a strong one 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.979
 would like to wear lipstick and then not 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.619
 so both beautiful to the new faces 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.560
 course, a little more expensive than the course 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.090
 Drugstore area but there is hardly any cancer 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.179
 or mainly in limited edition 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.039
 The warlike gives I think has there 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.630
 Worthwhile that was a limited then 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.920
 edition is still available at the moment 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.920
 standard range and I have you 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450
 Of course, everyone likes to bottom left in the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.700
 info box there is a new love in 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.170
 my life and this zuewa brush 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.539
 they are just super horny I have 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.850
 even before I started myself 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.829
 I have two liters of videos to make 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.789
 pallets ordered from zuewa at that time 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.530
 I could not do that with the brand yet 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.270
 start really much and then have 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.549
 at some point such a small one 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.280
 brush order abandoned and have 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.139
 now this my assortment and the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.969
 are incredibly awesome 

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:04.100
 I really am 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.679
 mainly only about a panel are 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.810
 a few others with it otherwise 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.180
 Just cover everything I do 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.180
 need and are qualitatively easy 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.430
 ultra good in super soft hardly lose 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.110
 hair what is super nice and see 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.130
 easy 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.990
 cultural property or not at the last hall 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.580
 of these he would go subtitled 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.170
 Highlighter sequence represents a liquid 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.870
 fallopian tube and this baby has 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.340
 definitely holy gral potential 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.780
 i use it since i have each one 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.620
 day and every day I am new 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.240
 he has this applicator of the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.950
 is really really easy 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.630
 make him use 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 you need relatively few are ten 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.110
 milliliter in that means he will me 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.780
 probably for a very long time 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.150
 I 'm sure that's enough 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.560
 under three euros has so that is 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.050
 really no money for such a horny 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.030
 product alverde props that's the hammer 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.310
 then I use currently very, very 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.110
 like red lipstick who would have it 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.209
 thought and I always change 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.280
 again between the manhattans often with 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.900
 livestream in red which is currently available 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.340
 again a standard range so far 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.770
 I know that had I think in the short term 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.750
 Let's get out and I already have that 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.080
 very very long and they are easy 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.489
 wonderfully easy to apply this 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.890
 easy peasy so spelled you can man 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.140
 still get and bye and the self 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.880
 from a limited edition by patrice 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.489
 is called black is also a matter 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.870
 lipstick the other too i like 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.040
 do not like those shiny ones 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.450
 That's why I'm attacking lipsticks 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.930
 actually always like to matt 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.390
 Lipsticks and are super good 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.070
 Apply matte lipsticks also hold 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.540
 just much longer and I think 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.340
 not that the dry lips themselves 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.049
 and I have it again and again 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580
 problems with it being something common 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.019
 are 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.000
 and then it does not help big either 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.220
 a lip care but this lipstick 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 really do not wear it big or big 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.620
 emphasize that again a very 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.120
 Great recommendation now not busy 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.100
 This one was janne limited edition 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.350
 but the software was green by 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.670
 Manhattan is great too 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.920
 you are welcome to have a look 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.140
 if you math lipsticks looking in 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.580
 red or in colors and how i like you 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.780
 already told the last video 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.459
 of course I am still on the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.109
 looking for the perfect styling product 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.810
 for my hair what I currently have 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.400
 still very much like to use and what 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.780
 I actually always use it 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.760
 is of tall ing 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.360
 the scouting squad 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.680
 the super awesome it powder there is 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 natural brands from other the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.220
 I tend always to 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.240
 Not that I'm after this year 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.340
 but would have bought the left immediately 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.900
 be empty and somehow there comes too 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.700
 nothing out but that's not true 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.320
 rather it should not be at all 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.770
 You sprinkle it a bit 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.110
 approach and can then work one 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.660
 an excellent effect so the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.360
 brings volume and gives a bit 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.800
 but not too extreme is frosted 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.020
 a little bit as if you were 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.540
 used too much then I see winning 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.100
 have relatively blunt but if you are there 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.630
 is careful and as I said there comes 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.950
 not so much out there you have to 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.380
 really have a little patience that 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.270
 is because well distributed but that is 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.850
 from the dosage here relatively perfect 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.420
 in the beginning because it exaggerates it because such a 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.010
 bit with 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.660
 but with time I have a good one 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.730
 Dosage found and then I have one 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.010
 little chat here what I still 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.470
 have in companies around for mine 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.110
 know that it is now the original canon 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.650
 he means c6 so I think remote 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.270
 control 6 works via infrared and that 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.740
 good thing about this one is that you have video 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.750
 can start with and not only 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.490
 do not focus what my other 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.590
 It was also essential 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.480
 bigger and has cost much more this 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.730
 has now cost only 13 or 14 euros 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.840
 I have ordered links from amazon 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.470
 Of course she will join us again 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.570
 infobox 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.710
 this is not money compared to the 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.210
 I had before with over 30 euros 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.560
 now unfortunately not by no idea 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.690
 sometimes two years or so the mind 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.610
 gave up although I did not like that 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.040
 I've used a lot so I'm very happy 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.270
 which now have the flawless 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.470
 works and you are very good 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.480
 can take with them because they are just like that 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.600
 distributed and then my absolute favorite 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.580
 and that have been around for two months 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.780
 I have my zara leather jacket 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.880
 to get to the birthday 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.750
 in january and since then i have the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.120
 just great to have the funds 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.430
 So when I go out and yes in winter 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.520
 she was still a bit cold 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.110
 but 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.569
 now that it gets warmer you can 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.949
 just great to wear that suits everything 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.930
 and I always said that someday 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.849
 can you get my leather jacket and that 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.800
 a real one and I have a brown one 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.599
 not real and why 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.819
 does not fit too but this black one 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.139
 in this biker style with the 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.629
 shoulder pads that a little more 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.639
 definition on the shoulders give the 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.590
 is just super awesome and wears 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.509
 really good I have the size l 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.190
 So leather jackets you really always have to 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.569
 Apparently buy something bigger because of the 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.289
 very very tight 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.880
 at least at tara but easy to me 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.610
 said the birthday has said 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.930
 at that time 170 180 euro costs and was 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.090
 I also immediately sell out and 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.280
 a bit more ps to complete and 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:08.240
 Although my tommy hilfiger books 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.580
 Bikerboots are exactly the same 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.770
 great but in the beginning to me mine 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.840
 Feet absolutely broken with those 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.940
 I confessed to kriegsfuß and the 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.380
 have missed me huge bubbles so 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.490
 that then partly two weeks 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.020
 could not carry and with it
