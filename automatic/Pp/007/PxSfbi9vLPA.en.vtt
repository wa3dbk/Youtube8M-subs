00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
Alberta even from Wednesday afternoon

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.420 
Alberta even from Wednesday afternoon
when<00:00:45.719> Environment<00:00:46.200> Canada<00:00:46.500> already<00:00:46.860> started

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
when Environment Canada already started

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.560 
when Environment Canada already started
having<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> heads<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> bad

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
having the heads up this would be a bad

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.619 
having the heads up this would be a bad
situation<00:00:48.920> slowly<00:00:49.920> makes<00:00:50.820> its<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.030> basically

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
situation slowly makes its way basically

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
situation slowly makes its way basically
along<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> divide<00:00:52.289> there's<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.800> mountain

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
along the divide there's your mountain

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
along the divide there's your mountain
range<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.579> once<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> gets<00:00:54.719> up

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
range right there once it gets up

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
range right there once it gets up
against<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> divide<00:00:55.410> stuck<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
against the divide stuck there so the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
against the divide stuck there so the
moisture<00:00:56.940> keeps<00:00:57.120> falling<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:57.750> place

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
moisture keeps falling in the same place

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040 
moisture keeps falling in the same place
I<00:00:59.300> think<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.420> why<00:01:00.510> everybody<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I think that's why everybody was so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
I think that's why everybody was so
shocked<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:02.070> were<00:01:02.129> asking<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.579> when

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
shocked at it they were asking me when

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.820 
shocked at it they were asking me when
to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> crest<00:01:03.870> when's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> bulk<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.710> this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to the crest when's the bulk of this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.109 
to the crest when's the bulk of this
moisture<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> Calgary

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
moisture going to make it to Calgary

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.330 
moisture going to make it to Calgary
well<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.140> day<00:01:07.320> buried<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> river<00:01:08.070> was

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
well the day buried in the river was

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
well the day buried in the river was
traveling<00:01:08.790> faster<00:01:09.330> than<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> cars<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
traveling faster than the cars on the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
traveling faster than the cars on the
highway<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.860> shooting<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> traveled

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
highway that was shooting it it traveled

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
highway that was shooting it it traveled
at<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> huge<00:01:12.900> rate<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> speed<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.740> big

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
at a huge rate of speed the big

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.130 
at a huge rate of speed the big
comparison<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.360> event<00:01:15.509> has<00:01:15.810> been<00:01:15.840> what

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
comparison with this event has been what

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
comparison with this event has been what
we<00:01:16.170> saw<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.619> 2005<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.330> what

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
we saw in 2005 and and you know what

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
we saw in 2005 and and you know what
initially<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.229> thought<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.979> good

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
initially I thought it was a good

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
initially I thought it was a good
comparison<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.689> 2005<00:01:22.590> we

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
comparison it's really not in 2005 we

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
comparison it's really not in 2005 we
had<00:01:23.430> three<00:01:23.880> storms<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> same<00:01:25.110> area<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
had three storms in the same area but

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.550 
had three storms in the same area but
three<00:01:26.310> storms<00:01:26.759> over<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> seven<00:01:27.630> days<00:01:27.869> stretch<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
three storms over a seven days stretch a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.819 
three storms over a seven days stretch a
seven-day<00:01:29.430> stretch<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.970> has<00:01:30.150> occurred<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
seven-day stretch this has occurred in

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.300 
seven-day stretch this has occurred in
essentially<00:01:31.939> totally<00:01:32.939> 30<00:01:33.360> 36<00:01:34.020> hours<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.619> saw

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
essentially totally 30 36 hours I saw

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
essentially totally 30 36 hours I saw
people<00:01:35.490> who<00:01:35.610> hadn't<00:01:36.000> enough<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.869> grab

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
people who hadn't enough time to grab

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.690 
people who hadn't enough time to grab
more<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.530> pets<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.130> didn't<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> any

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
more than the pets they didn't have any

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
more than the pets they didn't have any
valuables<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> medication<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.229> them

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
valuables in for the medication on them

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
valuables in for the medication on them
I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.970> managed<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.570> through

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I don't think we managed to get through

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.280 
I don't think we managed to get through
the<00:01:43.530> speed<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.880> occur<00:01:45.290> on

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the speed at which this was occur on

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
the speed at which this was occur on
Wednesday<00:01:46.770> evening<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.880> air<00:01:48.030> with

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
Wednesday evening when I was on air with

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.460 
Wednesday evening when I was on air with
the<00:01:48.240> National<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> said<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.350> will

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the National I said this will we will

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.600 
the National I said this will we will
have<00:01:49.590> localized<00:01:50.100> flooding

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
have localized flooding

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.240 
have localized flooding
