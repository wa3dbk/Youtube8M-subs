00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
was fun and there's a risk of hitting

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.120 
was fun and there's a risk of hitting
other<00:00:26.510> strings<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.260> they're<00:00:27.410> intended<00:00:27.980> one

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:51.360 
called a rest stroke paste let the pig
fall<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:40.660> drop<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.870> onto<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.790> next<00:00:44.030> string

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.700 

combined<00:00:52.370> with<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.730> vibrato<00:00:56.079> very<00:00:57.079> down

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
combined with the vibrato very down

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.030 
combined with the vibrato very down
strokes<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.550> because<00:00:59.590> some<00:01:00.590> of<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:00.800> gypsy

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
strokes to because some of this gypsy

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.780 
strokes to because some of this gypsy
state<00:01:02.379> let's<00:01:03.379> say<00:01:03.559> instead<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:04.009> alternating

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
state let's say instead of alternating

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.440 
state let's say instead of alternating
what<00:01:05.329> most<00:01:05.979> Western<00:01:06.979> or<00:01:07.430> American<00:01:07.909> guitarists

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
what most Western or American guitarists

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.449 
what most Western or American guitarists
are<00:01:08.539> used<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:09.079> is<00:01:09.200> playing<00:01:09.469> up<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.920> down<00:01:10.100> or

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:10.459 
are used to is playing up and down or

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.330 
are used to is playing up and down or
maybe<00:01:10.670> sweep<00:01:10.999> but<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.840> gypsies<00:01:12.079> they<00:01:12.439> kind<00:01:13.249> of

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
maybe sweep but the gypsies they kind of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.699 
maybe sweep but the gypsies they kind of
every<00:01:13.729> time<00:01:13.939> they<00:01:14.090> change<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:15.109> string<00:01:15.439> they

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
every time they change the string they

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.830 
every time they change the string they
like<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.159> go<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.459> down<00:01:16.670> right<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.209> going<00:01:17.539> up

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
like to go it down right and going up

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.410 
like to go it down right and going up
it's<00:01:18.229> very<00:01:18.289> similar<00:01:18.709> to<00:01:18.889> sweep<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.119> if<00:01:20.179> we<00:01:20.270> have

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
it's very similar to sweep so if we have

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.170 
it's very similar to sweep so if we have
a<00:01:20.450> phrase<00:01:20.719> like<00:01:20.749> this<00:01:21.109> a<00:01:21.289> minor<00:01:21.560> nine

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.820 

so<00:01:27.180> alternate<00:01:27.780> until<00:01:28.050> you<00:01:28.170> change<00:01:28.470> strings

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
so alternate until you change strings

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:41.660 
so alternate until you change strings
down<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.690> down<00:01:34.550> down<00:01:36.800> that's<00:01:37.800> right<00:01:40.640> yeah

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
down up down down down that's right yeah

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.860 
down up down down down that's right yeah
great<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.510> hear

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
great as you can hear

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.700 
great as you can hear
if<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.620> want<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.830> play<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> fast<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.970> easy<00:01:45.330> to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
if I want to play this fast very easy to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.280 
if I want to play this fast very easy to
to<00:01:46.710> control<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.720> slow<00:01:48.990> again

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to control it and now do it slow again

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.940 
to control it and now do it slow again
just<00:01:49.740> says

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.660 

right<00:01:54.520> now<00:01:54.700> fast<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.460> simple

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
right now fast think it's that simple

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.210 
right now fast think it's that simple
and<00:01:58.090> after<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> while<00:01:59.170> when<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.680> get<00:01:59.830> used<00:02:00.040> to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
and after a while when you get used to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.630 
and after a while when you get used to
this<00:02:00.310> technique<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.560> feels<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:03.430> feels

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
this technique it feels it feels

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.100 
this technique it feels it feels
comfortable<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.479> doesn't<00:02:04.840> mean<00:02:04.960> you

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
comfortable and that doesn't mean you

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.530 
comfortable and that doesn't mean you
don't<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.009> can't<00:02:06.430> use<00:02:06.759> alternate

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
don't that you can't use alternate

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540 
don't that you can't use alternate
anymore<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.319> good<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.649> use<00:02:08.800> both<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.340> can

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
anymore it's good to use both you can

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.910 
anymore it's good to use both you can
use<00:02:09.670> sweep<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.989> have<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.200> part<00:02:11.770> of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
use sweep and just to have it part of

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.850 
use sweep and just to have it part of
your<00:02:12.040> musical<00:02:12.670> vocabulary<00:02:13.620> according<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.739> the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
your musical vocabulary according to the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.790 
your musical vocabulary according to the
situation<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.819> always<00:02:15.940> change<00:02:16.709> but<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
situation you can always change but the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.430 
situation you can always change but the
most<00:02:17.950> difficult<00:02:18.190> thing<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.940> going<00:02:19.440> is

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
most difficult thing is going is

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.250 
most difficult thing is going is
actually<00:02:20.980> um<00:02:21.420> descending<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.569> because

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
actually um descending and because

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680 
actually um descending and because
instead<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.040> doing<00:02:24.849> like<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.300> gypsies

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
instead of doing like this the gypsies

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.650 
instead of doing like this the gypsies
do<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.959> same<00:02:26.200> thing<00:02:26.530> they<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.630> a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
do the same thing they they do a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.660 
do the same thing they they do a
downstroke<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.590> every<00:02:29.860> string<00:02:30.160> change<00:02:30.459> when

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
downstroke on every string change when

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.610 
downstroke on every string change when
they<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:30.940> down<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.019> we<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.410> as<00:02:32.590> a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
they go down so if we have this as a

this<00:03:52.709> gypsy<00:03:52.890> picking<00:03:53.400> thing<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.790> really

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
this gypsy picking thing is really

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.080 
this gypsy picking thing is really
useful<00:03:55.110> but<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.440> takes<00:03:55.650> time<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.280> well

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
useful but it takes time to well

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.729 
useful but it takes time to well
probably<00:03:57.510> everything<00:03:57.780> else<00:03:58.140> little<00:03:58.590> bit

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
probably everything else little bit

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.250 
probably everything else little bit
every<00:03:59.040> day
