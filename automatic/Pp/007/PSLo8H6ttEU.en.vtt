00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 hi guys today we make a duo for 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.019
 carry out contouring made from the ground 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.780
 and from a compact foundation we say more 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.309
 indeed the formula is illuminating 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 it is very similar to that of the foundation 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 compact and the clear part we have it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.140
 made by lightening the foundation 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 I will then write to you in the recipe 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 as you must do then simply 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 you will add titanium dioxide which 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 talc or only tarchi while the part 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 dark is simply the earth that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.899
 we realized some time ago in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.899
 powder of which I leave the recipe in the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.420
 Information box as packaging has 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.700
 used a recycled packaging of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.340
 old blush that I owe to this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 brush also very nice though 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 is advanced a little bit in the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 recipe because mine generate a lot 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 small and omitted in these two 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.160
 containers as you see goes 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 very well even if paid even if to me 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.079
 really like having them together this is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 always the clear version is in the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 dark version despite it shows 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.260
 I can assure you of the shimmer effect 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 now I'll show you that as soon as 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.060
 apply it completely mad 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.400
 I kept the two glasses in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 which made the recipe is therefore 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 now I'll show you immediately how 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.430
 they write on the skin 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.970
 this is the clear one it really is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 very clear next to the dark one is yes 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.740
 they fade very well they write well now not 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.750
 notice the mess that I combine 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.390
 mixing in but it is only to make you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.700
 see how they work perfectly 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.980
 so I find it really a product 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.230
 useful and simple direct 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.150
 as I told you, the recipe is similar to 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.830
 that of the compact foundation therefore it 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 you can do all 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.200
 I leave you immediately to the recipe and to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200
 method 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.380
 first we see rice oil a 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.300
 medium oil very suitable for recipes of 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.240
 in fact I have cream products 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.910
 used in the first compact foundation 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.369
 it is a repetition also this time then 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.920
 add the oil of jojoba oil of 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.080
 jojoba that a very light oil and that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.540
 I find it suitable because there is no skin 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.390
 and it moisturizes but leaves the skin a lot 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.640
 dry and we also add a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.500
 very light oil we already have 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.660
 used in other recipes if there is not 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.820
 you used coca private or 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.370
 increase the jojoba oil or 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.650
 used the class or meaning in short it is not 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.380
 fundamental though it touches dry and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 now let's add the powder into the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.400
 clear version ios clarified the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.920
 mineral foundation and did it 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.810
 to become of this very powder color 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.310
 clear of course if you want it more 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.830
 light darker 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.080
 you must increase the amount of fund 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.640
 mineral or decrease it according to 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.890
 your needs anyway in the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.890
 recipe that gave an indication for 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.150
 have this coloring up and down 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.070
 we mix everything for good and me 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.739
 I recommend melting all the lumps 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.020
 lose a 5 10 minutes until when 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.020
 it will not become a homogeneous compound 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.090
 add the cocoa butter I find 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.020
 excellent in compact products 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.020
 because it is not greasy 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.970
 and then we add the beeswax waxes 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:34.030
 candelilla carnauba wax 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.950
 let it all melt in a bain-marie 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.960
 now that everything is dissolved I have 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.600
 also done the same thing for the 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.950
 dark or simply version 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.360
 used the land instead of the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.310
 then lightened foundation 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.480
 simply the same procedure is 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.960
 instead of putting the foundation 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.240
 lightened I inserted the earth then 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.850
 now that everything is usual can go to 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.940
 enter the flop that will add a touch 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.860
 even drier to our duo for 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.020
 with touring and I also add one 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.880
 fragrance this is the gang sim wind 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.580
 cosmetics that are hypoallergenic 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.250
 eventually put omit a 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.260
 rome for sweets and mix everything for 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.140
 to disperse the brief is also the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.930
 fragrance and then pour everything inside 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.760
 of your gardens and leave 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.950
 rest for a quarter of an hour twenty 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.420
 minutes until it will become 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.420
 completely solid 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.780
 now it has solidified as you see it is 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.120
 really beautiful and I can assure you 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.680
 that works fine made me 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.350
 see already at the beginning of the video how 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.300
 writes and I used it in different make 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.180
 up realized I also posted 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.450
 some photos on instagram work 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.450
 really very very well and it really is 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.390
 beautiful to carry in the bag and it 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.030
 I find a very good product if you do it 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.890
 and let me know how you are and there 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.890
 see you at the next video bye
