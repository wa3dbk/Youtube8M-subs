00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.699 

here's<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.810> puzzle<00:00:01.050> box<00:00:01.199> that<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.380> built<00:00:01.589> for

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
here's the puzzle box that I built for

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.070 
here's the puzzle box that I built for
Caltech<00:00:02.010> dish<00:00:02.190> today<00:00:02.340> 2011<00:00:03.179> it<00:00:03.929> was

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
Caltech dish today 2011 it was

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.450 
Caltech dish today 2011 it was
integrated<00:00:04.560> into<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> full<00:00:05.130> day<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.279> activities

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
integrated into a full day of activities

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.950 
integrated into a full day of activities
and<00:00:05.940> puzzles<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.450> can't<00:00:06.629> really<00:00:06.720> show<00:00:06.899> you

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
and puzzles so I can't really show you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.419 
and puzzles so I can't really show you
everything<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.859> can<00:00:07.980> always<00:00:08.099> give<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.370> a

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
everything but I can always give you a

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.339 
everything but I can always give you a
good<00:00:08.550> idea<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.240> box<00:00:09.450> itself<00:00:12.170> so<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
good idea of the box itself so it's a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.049 
good idea of the box itself so it's a
normal<00:00:13.530> puzzle<00:00:13.860> box<00:00:14.040> with<00:00:14.429> some<00:00:14.730> other<00:00:14.880> things

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
normal puzzle box with some other things

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.410 
normal puzzle box with some other things
that<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.269> created<00:00:15.480> into<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> starts<00:00:16.680> off<00:00:16.890> with

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
that you created into it starts off with

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.570 
that you created into it starts off with
slide<00:00:18.420> right<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:20.180> visualize<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:23.400> fur

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
slide right here visualize this this fur

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.029 
slide right here visualize this this fur
has<00:00:24.199> nothing<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> distract<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> little

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
has nothing to distract you for a little

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.070 
has nothing to distract you for a little
while

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
while

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.569 
while
you're<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> key<00:00:30.109> whatever<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> hell<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
you're the key whatever the hell this is

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:41.139 
you're the key whatever the hell this is
and<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:34.410> ran<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> picture<00:00:39.829> all<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> way

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
and I ran the picture all the way

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
and I ran the picture all the way
doesn't<00:00:42.149> magnet<00:00:42.480> right<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> puzzle

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
doesn't magnet right here so the puzzle

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.430 
doesn't magnet right here so the puzzle
box<00:00:50.399> actually<00:00:50.640> continues<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> other<00:00:51.750> side

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.470 

there's<00:00:58.440> another<00:00:58.500> slide<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.480> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
there's another slide right here that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
there's another slide right here that
slides<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:01.050> which<00:01:02.010> allows<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:02.609> here

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
slides up which allows this right here

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
slides up which allows this right here
to<00:01:02.820> slide<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:05.510> allowing<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.780> side<00:01:07.020> just

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to slide over allowing this side just

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
to slide over allowing this side just
slide<00:01:08.220> over<00:01:08.369> again<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:14.840> usually<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.110> look

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
slide over again and usually you look

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109 
slide over again and usually you look
for<00:01:16.439> another<00:01:16.500> slide<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.000> actually

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
for another slide but there is actually

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.410 
for another slide but there is actually
isn't<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.659> there's<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.439> small<00:01:19.680> hole<00:01:20.420> which

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
isn't one there's this small hole which

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.690 
isn't one there's this small hole which
is<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.810> piece<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
is what this piece here is for in the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
is what this piece here is for in the
actual<00:01:23.970> activities<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.659> had<00:01:24.840> people<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
actual activities I had people do this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
actual activities I had people do this
piece<00:01:26.490> wasn't<00:01:26.820> actually<00:01:27.240> included<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.619> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
piece wasn't actually included this was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.620 
piece wasn't actually included this was
actually<00:01:29.280> there's<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.210> another<00:01:30.360> map

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
actually there's actually another map

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.080 
actually there's actually another map
that<00:01:30.960> showed<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> steam<00:01:31.439> vent<00:01:31.619> part<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> that's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
that showed a steam vent part and that's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
that showed a steam vent part and that's
being<00:01:33.509> steam<00:01:33.810> vent<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.110> stick<00:01:34.380> into<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> curve

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
being steam vent a stick into a curve

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.539 
being steam vent a stick into a curve
that<00:01:35.759> match<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.180> presses<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> lever

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
that match this so this presses a lever

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
that match this so this presses a lever
inside<00:01:41.549> pops<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.119> another<00:01:42.990> key

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.550 

so<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:51.390> much<00:01:52.290> longer<00:01:52.530> II

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
so it's actually pretty much longer II

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.910 
so it's actually pretty much longer II
stood<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> puzzlebox<00:01:53.430> part<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.920> now

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
stood the puzzlebox part of this but now

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.749 
stood the puzzlebox part of this but now
you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.280> figure<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.610> how<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you have to actually figure out how to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429 
you have to actually figure out how to
open<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.720> these<00:01:57.840> two<00:01:57.990> keys<00:01:58.259> right

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
open it you have these two keys right

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.850 
open it you have these two keys right
here<00:01:59.570> but<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.020> look<00:02:01.200> closely<00:02:01.470> there's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
here but if you look closely there's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.990 
here but if you look closely there's
actually<00:02:02.159> no<00:02:02.280> way<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> use<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.759> currently

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
actually no way to use them currently

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.279 
actually no way to use them currently
you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.450> there's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.720> metal<00:02:07.080> plate

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
you can see that there's a metal plate

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.610 
you can see that there's a metal plate
right<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.619> front<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> both<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> keyholes

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.970 

so<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.830> know<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> plate<00:02:14.540> actually

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so that you know in the plate actually

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.559 
so that you know in the plate actually
is<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.220> picture<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.180> see<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
is in the picture you can see that the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.210 
is in the picture you can see that the
clock<00:02:18.840> actually<00:02:19.230> matches<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.590> clock<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
clock actually matches the clock on the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.750 
clock actually matches the clock on the
box<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> look<00:02:22.680> at<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.920> hour<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
box so if you look at the hour of the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.039 
box so if you look at the hour of the
minute<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.150> second<00:02:24.450> hand<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.780> use<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
minute in the second hand and use the

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:51.020 
minute in the second hand and use the
magnet

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.150 

or<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.240> didn't<00:02:52.450> work<00:02:52.630> because<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.980> really

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
or that didn't work because it's really

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.380 
or that didn't work because it's really
hard<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.459> hold<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> Cameron<00:02:55.000> do<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.209> at<00:02:55.300> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
hard to hold the Cameron do this at the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.470 
hard to hold the Cameron do this at the
same<00:02:55.540> time<00:03:02.610> if<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.670> go<00:03:03.790> exactly<00:03:04.030> onto<00:03:04.330> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
same time if I go exactly onto the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.660 
same time if I go exactly onto the
numbers<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.650> right<00:03:05.740> order<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:08.610> get<00:03:09.610> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
numbers in the right order you get the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.750 
numbers in the right order you get the
plates<00:03:09.910> now<00:03:10.120> gone

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
plates now gone

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.030 
plates now gone
both<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.880> these<00:03:12.940> keys<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:13.510> be<00:03:13.660> inserted

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.740 

these<00:03:21.040> two<00:03:21.190> keys<00:03:21.400> actually<00:03:21.850> have<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.120> be<00:03:22.239> both

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
these two keys actually have to be both

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.440 
these two keys actually have to be both
turned<00:03:23.110> simultaneously<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:25.000> opposite

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
turned simultaneously in opposite

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.979 
turned simultaneously in opposite
directions<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:33.390> that's<00:03:34.390> all<00:03:34.510> there<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.840> it

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
directions and that's all there is to it

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.770 
directions and that's all there is to it
inside<00:03:35.860> here<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.430> mean<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.390> actually<00:03:37.630> can't

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
inside here I mean you actually can't

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.960 
inside here I mean you actually can't
see<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.110> but<00:03:38.830> there's<00:03:39.160> something<00:03:39.340> similar<00:03:39.760> to

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
see it but there's something similar to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.900 
see it but there's something similar to
a<00:03:40.080> master<00:03:41.080> lock<00:03:41.230> mechanism<00:03:41.830> that's<00:03:42.489> around

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
a master lock mechanism that's around

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.050 
a master lock mechanism that's around
the<00:03:43.150> stubborn<00:03:43.540> piece<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:43.959> here<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:45.850> a

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the stubborn piece right here so it's a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.180 
the stubborn piece right here so it's a
simplified<00:03:46.570> version<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.739> just<00:03:47.890> as<00:03:48.070> you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
simplified version but it just as you

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.740 
simplified version but it just as you
saw<00:03:48.370> requires<00:03:48.760> three<00:03:49.120> different<00:03:49.390> positions

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
saw requires three different positions

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.270 
saw requires three different positions
that<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.959> have<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.140> rotate<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.800> device<00:03:51.040> to

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
that you have to rotate the device to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.060 
that you have to rotate the device to
and<00:03:51.900> that's<00:03:52.900> basically<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.380> just<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.739> simple

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and that's basically it just a simple

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.910 
and that's basically it just a simple
spring<00:03:54.549> latch<00:03:54.730> mechanism
