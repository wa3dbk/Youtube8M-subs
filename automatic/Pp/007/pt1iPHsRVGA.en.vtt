00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
move the host a little bit because it

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.140

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.129 
but I mean I have faith in the movie
that<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.979> will<00:04:53.189> do<00:04:53.430> good<00:04:53.639> hopefully<00:04:54.330> um<00:04:54.629> but

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
that it will do good hopefully um but

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.140 
that it will do good hopefully um but
i'm<00:04:55.259> not<00:04:55.469> sure<00:04:55.529> about<00:04:55.830> sequels<00:04:56.400> because<00:04:56.879> i

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
i'm not sure about sequels because i

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.059 
i'm not sure about sequels because i
don't<00:04:57.960> know<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.289> books<00:04:58.500> didn't<00:04:58.800> really

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
don't know the books didn't really

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.939 
don't know the books didn't really
correspond<00:04:59.819> together<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.449> flow<00:05:00.719> i<00:05:01.080> hope<00:05:01.770> it

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
correspond together and flow i hope it

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.800 
correspond together and flow i hope it
does<00:05:02.159> do<00:05:02.430> sequels<00:05:02.879> because<00:05:03.389> like<00:05:03.599> gathering

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
does do sequels because like gathering

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.899 
does do sequels because like gathering
blue<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:04.680> then<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.979> enjoy<00:05:05.279> those<00:05:05.490> were<00:05:05.699> really

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
blue and then is enjoy those were really

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.629 
blue and then is enjoy those were really
good<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.870> could<00:05:07.110> be<00:05:07.229> cool<00:05:07.500> but<00:05:07.710> yeah<00:05:08.159> they're

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
good it could be cool but yeah they're

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.999 
good it could be cool but yeah they're
kind<00:05:08.879> of<00:05:08.909> boy<00:05:09.110> yeah<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:10.379> they<00:05:10.469> probably<00:05:10.800> have

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
kind of boy yeah so they probably have

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.830 
kind of boy yeah so they probably have
to<00:05:11.069> change<00:05:11.189> it<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.580> little<00:05:11.639> bit<00:05:11.819> but<00:05:12.090> I've

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
to change it a little bit but I've

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.390 
to change it a little bit but I've
really<00:05:13.289> wish<00:05:13.379> they<00:05:13.500> did<00:05:13.650> black<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.009> white<00:05:14.129> but

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
really wish they did black and white but

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.079 
really wish they did black and white but
I<00:05:14.900> guess<00:05:15.900> when<00:05:16.110> he<00:05:16.169> was<00:05:16.289> running<00:05:16.469> away<00:05:16.740> with<00:05:17.610> um

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:18.089 
I guess when he was running away with um

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.860 
I guess when he was running away with um
Gabe<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.889> that's<00:05:20.159> when<00:05:20.370> they<00:05:20.550> got<00:05:20.729> some<00:05:21.360> taken

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
Gabe and that's when they got some taken

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.369 
Gabe and that's when they got some taken
I<00:05:22.050> guess<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.039> was<00:05:23.219> instead<00:05:23.969> of<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.569> bicycle

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
I guess that was instead of the bicycle

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.839 
I guess that was instead of the bicycle
scene<00:05:25.650> but<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.860> bicycle<00:05:26.189> scenes<00:05:26.430> at<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.639> end

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
scene but the bicycle scenes at the end

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.730 
scene but the bicycle scenes at the end
I<00:05:27.150> don't<00:05:27.389> understand<00:05:27.779> because<00:05:27.960> at<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.319> end<00:05:28.349> of

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
I don't understand because at the end of

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.300 
I don't understand because at the end of

putting the needle that makes sense I am
saying<00:06:05.969> out<00:06:06.149> so<00:06:06.419> they're<00:06:06.870> putting<00:06:07.289> the

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:07.649 
saying out so they're putting the

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:10.700

would be great if the leases I had a

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.379 
would be great if the leases I had a
flashback<00:06:16.139> and<00:06:16.469> charter<00:06:16.830> back<00:06:17.009> then<00:06:17.250> yeah<00:06:18.149> but

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
flashback and charter back then yeah but
