 lily paint was created on a lion of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.330
 gold and this crystal drop here in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.490
 Half looks at what a beautiful thing and reads 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 now we also have tendencies 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 Spring Summer Geometric Shapes 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.689
 nor legal of the maria that she sends 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.350
 her chance is high. 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.390
 seeing that it refers to this tendency 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 geometric ok I found this earring 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
 Most beautiful thing I think he's already 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.090
 my 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.299
 Look, it's really nice to use the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.250
 place of the ceremony only then the list of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.990
 materials in this group will be 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.439
 box of information in case you want 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 and he also maintains teams in 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.970
 Okay, so if you like the idea. 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.970
 How do I want to buy him a kit? 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.930
 It's just getting there and copying it. 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.860
 equal 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.050
 it occurs that the house 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.670
 the material are you want to apply on 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 other things he put the droplet 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.300
 here in another color or if you already 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.760
 have a reason to buy sun 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.260
 the filigree his base of pinto also he 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.479
 were there going to be down here the blocks 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.270
 information is fine so if you want 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.060
 to know how birds this marcelinho is only 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.250
 continue watching this video for 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 Start this joked I'll start sticking 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.900
 the lollipop inside my droplet 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.770
 many girls have doubts on how to paste 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.530
 This little dick in the droplet teaches 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.640
 you with the two-component glue that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.310
 We'll use it when the two 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.230
 components will use 12 minutes 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.870
 I've done the mixing of parts if you do not 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.239
 Do you know how to use I see our video 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.770
 adhesives I'll leave here the link and how 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.870
 use glue 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.739
 There you go and pick it up. 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.140
 will pass the crown of this formula on 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:54.680
 cavity of your droplet may pass through 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.840
 placing inside the cavity inside 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.500
 let the camera focus puts you in there 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:09.950
 and have a good afternoon, my over here 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:13.010
 of the droplet and neither the camera sucker comes 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.860
 with pacifier and places like that and leaves 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.370
 it dry a position and a neighbor or 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.970
 here is a board so I put 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.269
 her feet on the ground to show 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.560
 You I have this board I put the 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.000
 company came here so a board her 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.080
 stay this way will not fall 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.320
 I think it was going to paste into peta do 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.840
 This is the same with the other one too. 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.400
 process with both and allow to dry 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.410
 while our expectation will be 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.540
 When are we going to put more than 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.010
 our border of our stamping 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.040
 in spring summer the trend of 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.569
 The increase that is taken and has is it is 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.500
 wrong looks with a one image acinte 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:07.970
 Bunny not pillay is looking very handsome 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.689
 So we'll get the account code 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.930
 boring and I think he comes with her behind 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:18.620
 this way you will get this 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 he box camera focus on this pliers and 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.570
 will open very carefully by twisting the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:29.180
 a little're the link that will pass here 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.009
 stamped inside the flood with much 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.810
 care of these parts you have to 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.250
 work very carefully for you 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.699
 do not burn 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.910
 It's just look and it's going to stay that way and it's going to 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:45.669
 do this with what will also open the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.669
 link very carefully 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:55.400
 closes and now we'll put the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:58.840
 droplet prontinho pacifier notion already 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.860
 look at the kitten look how it looks now 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.289
 I 'm going to put this note here in the 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.389
 stamping otta stamping it has another 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.940
 Drill down here for you to hang 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.330
 even with utah pendant 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.780
 We'll get the link to go here in this 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.419
 passing that furinho utah and let's go 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.510
 put a lollipop so that the 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.659
 4 euro closing out of bed 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.750
 the closure of the self stays behind 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.270
 It's just the way he plays. I taught him 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.870
 ethical the closures are behind 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.210
 not to appear there you close with her 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.970
 This is how he will keep the 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:46.070
 double back here to not 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.460
 happen to pass let put here 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.190
 O 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.830
 This way you see that one does not 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.120
 happen to be stamped like the filigree 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.630
 It's very thin 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.090
 the print does not go by the link 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.130
 loose and ready made everyone plays okay 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.599
 seeing how the droplet in the 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.449
 very cool 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.849
 finish looks very cute with 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.160
 consequent droplets do not 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.860
 perfect with a pin on the skewer 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.020
 It looks really cool when these earrings 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.759
 so the detail of the droplet seems 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:24.110
 I quite like to put on a pacifier 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:26.389
 Also our earring is another video 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.580
