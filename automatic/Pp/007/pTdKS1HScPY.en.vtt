00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.840
Lets suppose that you were able every night
to dream any dream you wanted to dream,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.320
and you would naturally as you began on this
adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.420
You would have every kind of pleasure, you
see,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.610
and after several nights you would say, "well
that was pretty great."

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:34.000
But now lets have a surprise, lets have a
dream which isn't under control.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.800
Well something is going to happen to me that
i don't know what it's gonna be.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.280
Then you would get more and more adventurous,
and you would make further and further out

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:53.440
gambles as to what you would dream, and finally
you would dream where you are now.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.900
If you awaken from this illusion,
and you understand that black implies white,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.060
self implies other,
life implies death.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.700
You can feel yourself, not as a stranger in
the world,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.320
not as something here on probation, not as
something that has arrived here by fluke,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.400
but you can begin to feel your own existence
as absolutely fundamental.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:06.840
What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself.
