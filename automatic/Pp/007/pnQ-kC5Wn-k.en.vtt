00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.929
 is a cultural piece that has to have 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.490
 importance to the city has 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.099
 importance 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 it only valley paradise must have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.970
 character of a scream of a scream a scream 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.240
 more than culture 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.519
 now can not be a cry in the ratio 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 rich to be strong 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.340
 so I have several four shades 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.620
 shades of red 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.620
 the whole facade 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.390
 it is almost unbelievable today a city of 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.970
 20 thousand inhabitants can do a work 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.739
 of this size are almost 10,000 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:01.220
 square meters is a part is a theater 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.610
 with 720 seats from arts 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.720
 visual photography exhibitions painting 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 in the seven rooms for seminars lectures 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.759
 training and improvement of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.009
 teachers in the region and if the show is 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.670
 perspective is too big 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.700
 theater beach is the parking lot 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.300
 can have show so the curtain can open 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.720
 back then also the show can 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.320
 be directed directed to the other public 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.500
 be back here in only 720 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.500
 places were already 8 thousand 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:53.400
 the structure of concrete and painting is like 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.640
 the mass called mineral mortar 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.090
 already in the kitchen in the four 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.580
 red and there I gave the structure in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.600
 theater is a metallic structure with 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.640
 acoustic lining and also looks acoustic 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.590
 in the armchairs clarity enters here and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.900
 It gives a great tranquility to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 all i this space of visual arts 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.430
 whether it is conditioned to adequate lighting 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.750
 for each apology 19 in the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.740
 modesty sex on the beach is everything 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.360
 well but she animates this issue 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:42.300
 different types of focus and healthy and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:46.100
 in the current part with this criterion 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.760
 which is but the possible lateral 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.750
 practically does not need air 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.900
 conditioning 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.330
 especially the ceiling must have a 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.970
 good soundproofing that you get 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.180
 clad the cat's walls and also the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.800
 furnace the material of melo silva acoustic 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.800
 and a shell and the floor too 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.630
 The work has to be friends with the city. 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:19.260
 to be friendly to the population and that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.860
 city ​​to take pride in its architecture 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.210
 I try to continue this freedom 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.630
 drawing this action of the architect inside 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.110
 of the contemporary world and which has 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.500
 an international language of expression 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:42.560
 with Brazilian roots great challenge and 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.560
 if you make it surprising 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.560
 contemporary
