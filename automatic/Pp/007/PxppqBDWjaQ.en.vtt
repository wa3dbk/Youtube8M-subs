00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
over a year probably 18 months there's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.779 
over a year probably 18 months there's
an<00:00:24.359> original<00:00:24.539> idea<00:00:24.839> from<00:00:25.140> Carl<00:00:25.380> Paschal<00:00:25.740> II<00:00:25.800> he

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
an original idea from Carl Paschal II he

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.189 
an original idea from Carl Paschal II he
developed<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> else<00:00:27.720> though<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.079> original

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
developed the else though the original

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.540 
developed the else though the original
stone<00:00:28.650> indicate<00:00:28.949> when<00:00:29.099> he<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.249> fishing<00:00:29.369> there

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
stone indicate when he was fishing there

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
stone indicate when he was fishing there
like<00:00:29.699> how<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> set<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.689> probably<00:00:30.960> six<00:00:31.230> or

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
like how about a set for probably six or

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
like how about a set for probably six or
seven<00:00:31.650> years<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.640> felt<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.360> know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
seven years and we felt that you know

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.700 
seven years and we felt that you know
I'd<00:00:33.539> be<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> good<00:00:33.840> addition<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.260> our<00:00:34.350> range

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I'd be a good addition to our range

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.430 
I'd be a good addition to our range
spoke<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> Carl<00:00:35.789> got<00:00:36.420> his<00:00:36.539> permission<00:00:36.840> paid

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
spoke to Carl got his permission paid

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.439 
spoke to Carl got his permission paid
him<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.710> real<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.699> we<00:00:38.789> are<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
him a little real way and here we are so

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.729 
him a little real way and here we are so
what<00:00:39.600> makes<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.050> different<00:00:40.199> is<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> fact

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
what makes it so different is the fact

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
what makes it so different is the fact
that<00:00:40.859> the<00:00:41.010> line<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.430> actually<00:00:41.579> gripped<00:00:42.000> by<00:00:42.539> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that the line is actually gripped by the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
that the line is actually gripped by the
clip<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.620> whenever<00:00:43.890> there's<00:00:44.100> any<00:00:44.160> movement

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
clip so whenever there's any movement

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.610 
clip so whenever there's any movement
the<00:00:45.000> actual<00:00:45.270> indicator<00:00:45.690> moves<00:00:45.930> rather<00:00:46.469> than

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the actual indicator moves rather than

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.810 
the actual indicator moves rather than
line<00:00:46.800> moving<00:00:47.100> through<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> indicator

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
line moving through the indicator

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520 
line moving through the indicator
dresser<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:48.989> fishing<00:00:49.199> with<00:00:49.230> slack

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
dresser when you're fishing with slack

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.709 
dresser when you're fishing with slack
lines<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.210> quite

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
lines you know you can have them quite

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.599 
lines you know you can have them quite
low<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.469> pit<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.039> pivot<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
low because the pit they pivot on this

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.090 
low because the pit they pivot on this
axis<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.019> so<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.769> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
axis here and so you get all the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.569 
axis here and so you get all the
movement<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.570> line<00:00:57.750> bias<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:58.370> using<00:00:59.370> stuff

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
movement with line bias and using stuff

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.669 
movement with line bias and using stuff
like<00:00:59.670> fluorocarbon<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.019> indication<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
like fluorocarbon the indication is

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.919 
like fluorocarbon the indication is
incredible<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.089> not<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> new<00:01:03.480> idea<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
incredible but it's not a new idea I

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.110 
incredible but it's not a new idea I
mean<00:01:04.170> coal<00:01:04.410> make<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:05.100> indicates<00:01:05.460> 15-20

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
mean coal make these indicates 15-20

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.730 
mean coal make these indicates 15-20
years<00:01:06.180> ago<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.050> know<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.230> the<00:01:07.290> original<00:01:07.590> ones

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
years ago you know in the original ones

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
years ago you know in the original ones
were<00:01:07.830> made<00:01:08.010> from<00:01:08.100> syringes<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.820> carbon

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
were made from syringes with carbon

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.300 
were made from syringes with carbon
clips<00:01:10.020> whipped<00:01:10.230> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> side<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.160> they

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
clips whipped on the side and they

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.490 
clips whipped on the side and they
actually<00:01:11.400> I've<00:01:11.880> tried<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.300> keep<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:13.140> look<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
actually I've tried to keep the look of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.480 
actually I've tried to keep the look of
them<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.880> same<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.930> using

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
them you know the same but just using

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
them you know the same but just using
plastic<00:01:17.490> moldings<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.720> little

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
plastic moldings and you know little

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890 
plastic moldings and you know little
stainless<00:01:19.590> bits<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.190> their<00:01:20.570> record<00:01:21.570> attack

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
stainless bits on their record attack

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
stainless bits on their record attack
the<00:01:22.110> quarter<00:01:22.410> technics<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.190> ridiculous<00:01:24.060> yeah

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the quarter technics is ridiculous yeah

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
the quarter technics is ridiculous yeah
they're<00:01:24.780> quite<00:01:24.870> neat<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> pack

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
they're quite neat when you get the pack

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
they're quite neat when you get the pack
you<00:01:27.000> get<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.990> little<00:01:28.140> short<00:01:28.470> extension<00:01:28.890> there

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you get the little short extension there

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.520 
you get the little short extension there
that's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> larger<00:01:30.510> indicated<00:01:30.870> Elkins<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that's the larger indicated Elkins and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's the larger indicated Elkins and
the<00:01:31.650> large<00:01:31.830> fox<00:01:32.070> indicators<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.940> then<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the large fox indicators and then on the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.620 
the large fox indicators and then on the
back<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.870> get<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.520> longer<00:01:35.520> version<00:01:35.790> which

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
back you get like a longer version which

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.740 
back you get like a longer version which
is<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.020> shorter<00:01:37.500> smaller<00:01:37.860> indicators

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
is for these shorter smaller indicators

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.940 
is for these shorter smaller indicators
because<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:40.020> happens<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
because what happens is when you get the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.860 
because what happens is when you get the
buy<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.850> want<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.120> line<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.360> actually

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
buy it you want the line to actually

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.110 
buy it you want the line to actually
pull<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.470> clip<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.980> it<00:01:44.100> drop<00:01:44.490> away<00:01:44.700> right

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
pull out the clip and it drop away right

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.690 
pull out the clip and it drop away right
okay<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> longer<00:01:46.710> stainless<00:01:47.460> part

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
okay so this longer stainless part

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.240 
okay so this longer stainless part
actually<00:01:47.970> stops<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.900> line<00:01:49.110> clip<00:01:49.410> from<00:01:49.680> going

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually stops the line clip from going

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.860 
actually stops the line clip from going
too<00:01:50.430> high<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.240> line<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.630> running

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
too high and the line just running

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.180 
too high and the line just running
through<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.230> so<00:01:52.440> every<00:01:52.590> time<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.800> get<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.980> bite

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
through it so every time you get a bite

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.370 
through it so every time you get a bite
or<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.910> get<00:01:54.060> tight<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.750> always<00:01:54.870> drop<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.260> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
or you get tight it always drop off the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590 
or you get tight it always drop off the
line<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:56.550> originally<00:01:56.730> indicators<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
line I was originally indicators it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.360 
line I was originally indicators it
looked<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.530> well<00:01:59.250> you've

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
looked more like this one well you've

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.650 
looked more like this one well you've
got<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.670> stones<00:01:59.880> weight<00:02:00.120> on<00:02:00.300> there<00:02:00.480> and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
got a little stones weight on there and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.930 
got a little stones weight on there and
they<00:02:00.780> were<00:02:00.870> just<00:02:01.020> glued<00:02:01.710> into<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.160> tube<00:02:02.430> this

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
they were just glued into the tube this

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.490 
they were just glued into the tube this
one's<00:02:03.150> always<00:02:03.270> got<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.510> nice<00:02:03.630> taupe<00:02:03.900> in<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.170> but

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
one's always got a nice taupe in it but

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
one's always got a nice taupe in it but
for<00:02:04.650> today<00:02:04.890> people<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.640> heavier

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
for today people want to have heavier

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.460 
for today people want to have heavier
weights<00:02:06.480> on<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> line<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.260> sort<00:02:07.440> of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
weights on the line and that sort of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.410 
weights on the line and that sort of
thing<00:02:07.620> so<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.610> we've<00:02:08.729> done<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.179> we've

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
thing so what we've done is we've

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
thing so what we've done is we've
developed<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:10.730> little<00:02:11.730> white<00:02:11.909> called<00:02:12.150> an

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
developed a little white called an

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.610 
developed a little white called an
overweight

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
overweight

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.040 
overweight
so<00:02:13.950> yeah<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.879> goes<00:02:15.180> over<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.599> top<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so yeah it goes over the top of the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.690 
so yeah it goes over the top of the
weight<00:02:16.200> that's<00:02:16.379> on<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> indicator<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
weight that's on the indicator and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.790 
weight that's on the indicator and
there's<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.300> little<00:02:18.480> shoulder<00:02:18.810> inside<00:02:19.140> tiny

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
there's a little shoulder inside tiny

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.540 
there's a little shoulder inside tiny
little<00:02:20.010> shoulder

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
little shoulder

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.759 
little shoulder
so<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:20.970> screws<00:02:21.239> inside<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
so this screws inside that and the

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.500 
so this screws inside that and the
actual<00:02:23.069> length<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> indicator<00:02:24.150> doesn't

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
actual length of the indicator doesn't

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
actual length of the indicator doesn't
increase<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> line<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:26.310> still<00:02:26.459> pull

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
increase so the line it will still pull

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.250 
increase so the line it will still pull
off<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.819> line<00:02:27.180> nice<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.930> meet<00:02:28.019> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
off the line nice to meet you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.869 
off the line nice to meet you
so<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.500> did<00:02:28.650> two<00:02:28.830> sizes<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.280> those<00:02:29.430> there's<00:02:29.760> one

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
so we did two sizes of those there's one

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.910 
so we did two sizes of those there's one
there<00:02:30.090> which<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.390> 8<00:02:30.690> grams<00:02:30.750> there's<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> little

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
there which is 8 grams there's a little

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.009 
there which is 8 grams there's a little
six<00:02:32.129> gram<00:02:32.340> one<00:02:32.519> there<00:02:32.760> covers<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.599> sizes

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
six gram one there covers all the sizes

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.750 
six gram one there covers all the sizes
and<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.739> go<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:35.099> light<00:02:35.370> what

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and if you want to go really light what

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.520 
and if you want to go really light what
you<00:02:35.849> can<00:02:36.000> do<00:02:36.500> unscrew<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.450> whip<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.349> 4

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
you can do unscrew it whip the little 4

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.650 
you can do unscrew it whip the little 4
gram<00:02:40.769> weight<00:02:40.980> off<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:42.030> attach<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.540> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
gram weight off just attach it like that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.360 
gram weight off just attach it like that
and<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.049> super<00:02:43.349> light<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.980> parts

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and it's super light just parts

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.370 
and it's super light just parts
aluminium<00:02:44.849> no<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:45.720> light<00:02:45.930> as<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.110> can<00:02:46.230> be

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
aluminium no it's as light as it can be

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.530 
aluminium no it's as light as it can be
so<00:02:46.799> really<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.160> an<00:02:47.430> indicator<00:02:47.819> used<00:02:48.269> in<00:02:48.390> any

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
so really is an indicator used in any

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.110 
so really is an indicator used in any
situation<00:02:48.630> pretty<00:02:49.319> much<00:02:49.560> yeah<00:02:49.829> tight<00:02:50.819> lines

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
situation pretty much yeah tight lines

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.920 
situation pretty much yeah tight lines
range<00:02:51.510> range<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.799> name<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.280> use<00:02:53.579> it

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
range range you name it you can use it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.509 
range range you name it you can use it
quite<00:02:54.930> neatly<00:02:55.200> it'll<00:02:55.410> fit<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:55.890> I've<00:02:56.400> got

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
quite neatly it'll fit on here I've got

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.770 
quite neatly it'll fit on here I've got
little<00:02:56.670> magnets<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.150> there<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:57.540> will<00:02:57.660> fit

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
little magnets in there so they will fit

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.819 
little magnets in there so they will fit
in<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.980> that

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
in there like that

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.559 
in there like that
we'll<00:03:01.829> call<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.129> up<00:03:02.220> attached<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.299> do<00:03:03.480> this

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
we'll call it up attached and we do this

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.850 
we'll call it up attached and we do this
little<00:03:03.750> case<00:03:03.989> which<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.410> store<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.739> in

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
little case which you can store them in

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.880 
little case which you can store them in
we've<00:03:05.250> got<00:03:05.280> magnet<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.760> bottom<00:03:06.709> fits<00:03:07.709> in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
we've got magnet on the bottom fits in

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.270 
we've got magnet on the bottom fits in
there

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
there

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.830 
there
you<00:03:08.430> guys<00:03:08.730> figure<00:03:08.940> whoever<00:03:09.120> flips<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.660> there

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you guys figure whoever flips on there

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.080 
you guys figure whoever flips on there
and<00:03:10.049> then<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.319> just<00:03:10.500> snaps<00:03:11.099> in<00:03:11.250> there<00:03:11.400> so

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and then it just snaps in there so

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.910 
and then it just snaps in there so
valuable<00:03:12.629> in<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> range<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.140> colors<00:03:13.410> yeah<00:03:13.680> right

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
valuable in a range of colors yeah right

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.470 
valuable in a range of colors yeah right
there<00:03:14.190> divided<00:03:14.549> with<00:03:14.640> six<00:03:14.819> colors<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.420> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
there divided with six colors just to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.789 
there divided with six colors just to
match<00:03:15.599> all<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.079> know<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.230> bile<00:03:16.470> arms<00:03:16.709> are

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
match all the you know the bile arms are

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:17.360 
match all the you know the bile arms are
available

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
available

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.729 
available
we've<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.000> matching<00:03:18.299> isotopes<00:03:18.780> really<00:03:19.590> easy

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
we've got matching isotopes really easy

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.990 
we've got matching isotopes really easy
to<00:03:19.920> see<00:03:20.069> them<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.489> we've<00:03:20.609> got<00:03:20.700> these<00:03:20.790> little

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
to see them so we've got these little

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.220 
to see them so we've got these little
cases<00:03:21.180> they<00:03:21.480> fit<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:21.959> they<00:03:22.049> got<00:03:22.139> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
cases they fit in so they got the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530 
cases they fit in so they got the
matching<00:03:22.590> color<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> head<00:03:23.700> for<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
matching color of the head for the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.390 
matching color of the head for the
isotope<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.319> simple<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.160> used

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
isotope really simple to see and used

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.069 
isotope really simple to see and used
the<00:03:26.970> only<00:03:27.060> other<00:03:27.269> thing<00:03:27.389> we've<00:03:27.510> got<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.959> do

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the only other thing we've got is we do

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.140 
the only other thing we've got is we do
a<00:03:28.109> little<00:03:28.319> adapter<00:03:28.799> when<00:03:29.790> these<00:03:29.910> little

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
a little adapter when these little

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.670 
a little adapter when these little
magnetic<00:03:30.420> adapters<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.109> if<00:03:31.380> you've<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.590> an

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
magnetic adapters so if you've got an

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.940 
magnetic adapters so if you've got an
existing<00:03:32.099> indicator<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.940> want<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> use<00:03:33.950> you

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
existing indicator you want to use you

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.120 
existing indicator you want to use you
know<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.130> can<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.370> buy<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.549> set<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.880> those<00:03:37.130> we

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
know you can just buy a set of those we

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.240 
know you can just buy a set of those we
start<00:03:38.549> out<00:03:39.470> we<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.620> whip<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.859> back<00:03:41.069> in

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
another little thing I've noticed here

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.460 
another little thing I've noticed here
is<00:03:59.099> yeah<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.639> saw<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.090> saw<00:04:00.239> STOBAR<00:04:00.780> let's<00:04:01.349> go

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
is yeah you saw it saw STOBAR let's go

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.500 
is yeah you saw it saw STOBAR let's go
with<00:04:01.620> Ryan<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.889> stone<00:04:02.099> indicators<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:02.790> was

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
with Ryan to stone indicators I was

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.349 
with Ryan to stone indicators I was
using<00:04:04.280> some<00:04:05.280> snag<00:04:05.819> bars<00:04:06.090> which<00:04:06.329> were

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
using some snag bars which were

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.360 
using some snag bars which were
basically<00:04:06.720> fixed<00:04:07.079> in<00:04:07.200> place<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.889> when<00:04:08.250> you

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
basically fixed in place and when you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.589 
basically fixed in place and when you
had<00:04:08.489> them<00:04:08.579> on<00:04:08.639> your<00:04:08.760> buzzer<00:04:08.910> bars<00:04:09.120> are<00:04:09.299> really

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
had them on your buzzer bars are really

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.000 
had them on your buzzer bars are really
difficult<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.109> move<00:04:10.260> from<00:04:10.500> left<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.769> right

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
difficult to move from left to right

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.229 
difficult to move from left to right
depending<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.519> what<00:04:11.639> side<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:11.940> wanted<00:04:12.150> to

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
depending on what side you wanted to

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.360 
depending on what side you wanted to
have<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:12.959> made<00:04:13.169> some<00:04:13.440> up<00:04:13.590> which<00:04:14.130> were

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
have it so I made some up which were

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.400 
have it so I made some up which were
well<00:04:15.209> basically<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.599> idea<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.320> can

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
well basically the idea is that you can

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.949 
well basically the idea is that you can
move<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:17.250> single<00:04:17.609> part<00:04:17.849> from<00:04:18.359> one<00:04:18.539> side<00:04:18.780> to

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
move the single part from one side to

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.020 
move the single part from one side to
the<00:04:18.989> other<00:04:19.079> cuz<00:04:19.739> really<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:20.070> suppose<00:04:20.160> generally

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
the other cuz really I suppose generally

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.640 
the other cuz really I suppose generally
only<00:04:21.150> need<00:04:21.389> only<00:04:21.599> one<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.200> only<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.469> taco

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
only need only one it's only the taco

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.589 
only need only one it's only the taco
tarts<00:04:23.010> want<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.460> 5<00:04:24.000> Gibbons<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.450> want

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
tarts want to 5 Gibbons you want

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.960 
tarts want to 5 Gibbons you want
symmetry<00:04:24.990> only<00:04:25.050> set<00:04:25.349> up<00:04:25.469> so<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.400> that

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
symmetry only set up so that that

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.700 
symmetry only set up so that that
the<00:04:27.150> original<00:04:27.480> idea<00:04:27.570> but<00:04:28.230> we've<00:04:28.410> ended<00:04:28.620> up

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
the original idea but we've ended up

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.100 
the original idea but we've ended up
with<00:04:28.770> two<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.760> can<00:04:29.790> either<00:04:30.030> fishing<00:04:30.450> one

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
with two and you can either fishing one

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.870 
with two and you can either fishing one
two<00:04:31.500> or<00:04:31.680> take<00:04:31.860> them<00:04:32.010> off<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.610> don't<00:04:32.640> have

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
two or take them off so you don't have

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.040 
two or take them off so you don't have
to<00:04:33.000> hate<00:04:33.120> even<00:04:33.420> having<00:04:33.630> one<00:04:33.660> there<00:04:33.930> when

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
to hate even having one there when

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.380 
to hate even having one there when
you're<00:04:34.230> packing<00:04:34.920> your<00:04:35.070> gear<00:04:35.310> away<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:36.180> pack

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
you're packing your gear away you pack

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.030 
you're packing your gear away you pack
away<00:04:36.540> nice<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.780> neatly<00:04:37.080> or<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:37.860> you're<00:04:37.980> not

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
away nice and neatly or if you're not

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.320 
away nice and neatly or if you're not
snag<00:04:38.310> fishing<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.820> might<00:04:38.970> not<00:04:39.090> want<00:04:39.210> them<00:04:39.300> on

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
snag fishing you might not want them on

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.300 
snag fishing you might not want them on
this<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.690> know<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.410> think<00:04:40.470> these<00:04:40.890> days<00:04:41.100> it's

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
this you know I think these days it's

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.860 
this you know I think these days it's
almost<00:04:41.730> become<00:04:42.060> fashion<00:04:43.670> equipment<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.660> why

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
almost become fashion equipment so why

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.240 
almost become fashion equipment so why
not<00:04:46.080> yeah<00:04:46.410> they're<00:04:46.740> made<00:04:46.890> out<00:04:47.010> of<00:04:47.070> aluminium

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
not yeah they're made out of aluminium

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.940 
not yeah they're made out of aluminium

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
apparently that's the that's the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.300 
apparently that's the that's the
northern<00:04:55.440> look<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.010> southern

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
northern look and this is the southern

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.960 
northern look and this is the southern
look<00:04:56.460> right<00:04:58.160> obviously<00:04:59.160> we're<00:04:59.400> mainly<00:04:59.880> here

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
look right obviously we're mainly here

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.190 
look right obviously we're mainly here
to<00:05:00.000> look<00:05:00.210> at<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.390> indicators<00:05:00.810> maybe<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.110> would

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
to look at the indicators maybe it would

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.800 
to look at the indicators maybe it would
be<00:05:01.230> rude<00:05:01.470> not<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.710> take<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:01.980> look<00:05:02.190> at<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.810> couple

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
be rude not to take a look at a couple

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.970 
be rude not to take a look at a couple
of<00:05:03.930> other<00:05:04.080> things<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.410> can<00:05:04.470> be<00:05:04.560> vital<00:05:04.890> in

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
of other things that can be vital in

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.950 
of other things that can be vital in
spring<00:05:05.310> we've<00:05:05.850> got<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> thing<00:05:06.540> called<00:05:06.600> dark

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
spring we've got a thing called dark

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.530 
spring we've got a thing called dark
matter<00:05:07.140> which<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> tungsten<00:05:08.400> products<00:05:08.880> with

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
matter which is a tungsten products with

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.870 
matter which is a tungsten products with
tungsten<00:05:09.690> products<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.620> tubing<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.760> we

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
tungsten products this is tubing and we

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.950 
tungsten products this is tubing and we
think<00:05:12.120> this<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.300> probably<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.780> heaviest

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
think this is probably the heaviest

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.040 
think this is probably the heaviest
softest<00:05:13.650> with<00:05:14.280> tubing<00:05:14.580> available<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.960> when

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
softest with tubing available and when

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.680 
softest with tubing available and when
it's<00:05:16.200> incredibly<00:05:16.800> heavy<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:18.330> become<00:05:18.570> really

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
it's incredibly heavy it's become really

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.450 
it's incredibly heavy it's become really
popular<00:05:18.930> isn't<00:05:19.169> it<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.350> mean<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.710> don't<00:05:20.100> use<00:05:20.220> to
