film about the end of all of us are
either<00:00:16.740> moving<00:00:17.369> from<00:00:17.699> somewhere<00:00:17.940> to

moved from somewhere to somewhere and I
think<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.470> very<00:00:22.560> clever

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830

because<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.070> think<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.279> looks<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> part<00:00:24.150> but

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480

because I think it looks like a part but
actually<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.109> about<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.500> these<00:00:25.830> people

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
actually what it's about is these people

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.320 
actually what it's about is these people
have<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.340> turned<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.820> doorstep<00:00:26.849> and

the<00:00:42.000> most<00:00:42.149> sophisticated<00:00:42.239> i'll<00:00:42.780> agree<00:00:42.899> that

well delivered and it's got it is quite

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
well delivered and it's got it is quite
good<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.120> puts<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> resonant<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
good because it puts the resonant the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
good because it puts the resonant the
resident<00:00:49.350> humans<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> bad

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
there going that's probably how I'd

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.390 
there going that's probably how I'd
react<00:01:36.360> probably<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710 
react probably how are you then at the
end<00:01:38.430> when<00:01:38.700> he<00:01:38.759> turns<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.119> around<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.479> becomes

end when he turns it around it becomes

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
end when he turns it around it becomes
irregular<00:01:40.200> yeah<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> don't<00:01:40.829> react<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
irregular yeah I don't react like that

irregular yeah I don't react like that
too<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.320> transformation<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
too I think that transformation to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
too I think that transformation to
somehow<00:01:43.649> help<00:01:43.740> someone<00:01:44.310> who<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> utterly

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
somehow help someone who is utterly

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
somehow help someone who is utterly

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
like that it wasn't until I started

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.050 
like that it wasn't until I started
seeing<00:02:21.739> trailers<00:02:22.190> we're<00:02:22.370> all<00:02:22.519> started<00:02:22.849> click

seeing trailers we're all started click

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.820 
seeing trailers we're all started click
together<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.629> they<00:02:23.780> were<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:24.200> were<00:02:24.260> working

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
together so they were they were working

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.100

well<00:02:25.160> well<00:02:25.489> out<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.120> think<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.750> builds

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
well well out and I think that builds

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.479 
well well out and I think that builds
anticipation<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.890> mean<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.129> look<00:02:28.160> at<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
anticipation I mean you look at the the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.860 
anticipation I mean you look at the the
spots<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.239> showed<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.750> there's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
spots that you showed here and there's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
spots that you showed here and there's
just<00:02:30.019> exciting<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.530> watch<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.190> thrilling<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
just exciting to watch and thrilling and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.280 
just exciting to watch and thrilling and
like<00:02:32.180> all<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.480> captures<00:02:32.840> my<00:02:32.959> maybe<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
like all that captures my maybe the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.350 
like all that captures my maybe the
spaceship<00:02:33.709> hovering<00:02:33.890> over<00:02:34.340> city<00:02:34.670> even<00:02:34.970> it's

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
spaceship hovering over city even it's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.729 
spaceship hovering over city even it's
not<00:02:35.480> blowing<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.959> white<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> think<00:02:36.260> it

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
not blowing up the white I think it

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.080 
not blowing up the white I think it
would<00:02:36.860> have<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.220> more<00:02:37.489> than<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:37.970> it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
would have to be more than that when it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.280 
would have to be more than that when it
would<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.420> be<00:02:38.450> more<00:02:38.660> than<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.900> campaign

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
would have to be more than the campaign

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.990 
would have to be more than the campaign
or<00:02:39.500> special<00:02:39.890> effects<00:02:40.160> or<00:02:40.250> even<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.549> good<00:02:40.730> script

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
or special effects or even a good script

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.360 
or special effects or even a good script
for<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.660> hit<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.080> hard<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:43.040> think<00:02:43.250> there

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
for it to hit so hard and I think there

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.580 
for it to hit so hard and I think there
is<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> deep<00:02:43.730> unease<00:02:43.940> now<00:02:44.299> for<00:02:44.599> us<00:02:44.720> about<00:02:45.170> how

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
is a deep unease now for us about how

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.930 
is a deep unease now for us about how
we're<00:02:45.829> treating<00:02:45.950> people<00:02:46.370> across<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.910> world
