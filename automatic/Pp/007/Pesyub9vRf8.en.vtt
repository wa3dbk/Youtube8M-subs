00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
there's a few ways you can try it one of

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.280 
there's a few ways you can try it one of
them<00:06:01.490> should<00:06:01.760> work<00:06:03.160> piece<00:06:04.930> because<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:06.050> works

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
them should work piece because it works

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.750 
them should work piece because it works
for<00:06:06.470> me<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:06.830> don't<00:06:07.100> know<00:06:07.190> which<00:06:07.430> one<00:06:07.640> in
