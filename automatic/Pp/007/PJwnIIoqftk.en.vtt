want the glass to work well across the
range<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> dark<00:01:50.250> beers<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.479> both

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
range of dark beers and we both

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.749 
range of dark beers and we both
ultimately<00:01:52.049> picked<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.070> same<00:01:53.310> final

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
ultimately picked the the same final

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.010 
ultimately picked the the same final
glass<00:01:53.970> which<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.509> glass<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
glass which was this glass so that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
glass which was this glass so that
really<00:01:55.140> validated<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> fact<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.640> work

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
really validated the fact that the work

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
really validated the fact that the work
we<00:01:56.939> had<00:01:57.030> done<00:01:57.060> within<00:01:57.420> rounds<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.049> two

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
we had done within rounds one and two

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.620 
we had done within rounds one and two
delivered<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> ultimate<00:01:59.369> style<00:02:00.030> class<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
delivered the ultimate style class in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
delivered the ultimate style class in
the<00:02:00.780> finished<00:02:01.229> product<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.340> were

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the finished product I think we were

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.300 
the finished product I think we were
both<00:02:02.750> pretty<00:02:03.750> gobsmacked<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.920> difference

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
both pretty gobsmacked at the difference

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.949 
both pretty gobsmacked at the difference
that<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.649> shape<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.890> form<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:09.000> opening<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that the shape and form and opening and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.660 
that the shape and form and opening and
every<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.500> different<00:02:10.830> technical<00:02:11.340> pieces

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
every all the different technical pieces

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.520 
every all the different technical pieces
of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> glass

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
of the glass

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.480 
of the glass
we<00:02:12.620> had<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:14.090> beer<00:02:14.600> experience<00:02:15.470> itself<00:02:15.860> now

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
we had on the beer experience itself now

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.160 
we had on the beer experience itself now
that<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.760> drink<00:02:17.000> ourselves<00:02:17.600> out<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:17.930> class

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
that I drink ourselves out of this class

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.410 
that I drink ourselves out of this class
it's<00:02:18.410> almost<00:02:18.680> impossible<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.850> go<00:02:19.970> back<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.390> a

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
it's almost impossible to go back to a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.780 
it's almost impossible to go back to a
more<00:02:20.690> standard<00:02:21.230> pint<00:02:21.890> glass<00:02:22.100> format<00:02:22.520> for<00:02:22.670> me

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
more standard pint glass format for me

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.400 
more standard pint glass format for me
because<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.569> aroma<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.230> way<00:02:24.350> it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
because the the aroma the way it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.620 
because the the aroma the way it
delivers<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.860> flavor<00:02:25.160> from<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.030> class<00:02:26.300> is

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
delivers the flavor from this class is

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.110 
delivers the flavor from this class is
just<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.080> vastly<00:02:27.650> superior<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.910> anything

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
just so vastly superior to anything

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.770 
just so vastly superior to anything
that's<00:02:29.420> that's<00:02:29.959> out<00:02:30.170> there<00:02:31.270> yes<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.450> put<00:02:32.660> my

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
that's that's out there yes I put my

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.270 
that's that's out there yes I put my
nose<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.470> just<00:02:33.500> smell<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
nose and I really just smell the the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
nose and I really just smell the the
malls<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.819> roastiness<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.600> richness<00:02:35.780> of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
malls the roastiness the richness of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
malls the roastiness the richness of
those<00:02:36.319> melts<00:02:36.650> really<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.190> jump<00:02:37.520> up<00:02:37.670> through

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
those melts really just jump up through

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.880 
those melts really just jump up through
the<00:02:38.060> glass<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.690> think<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:39.080> lot<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.530> shape<00:02:39.739> of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
the glass I think a lot of the shape of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.729 
the glass I think a lot of the shape of
the<00:02:39.950> rim<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.670> angle<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.300> rim

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
the rim just the angle of the rim

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.140 
the rim just the angle of the rim
consolidates<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.860> concentrates<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
consolidates and concentrates the the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.310 
consolidates and concentrates the the
aromas<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.690> puts<00:02:44.840> them<00:02:44.959> right<00:02:45.110> into<00:02:45.230> your

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
aromas and puts them right into your

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.530 
aromas and puts them right into your
nose<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:46.340> me<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> revolution<00:02:47.450> in

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
nose to me this is a revolution in

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.019 
nose to me this is a revolution in
glassware
