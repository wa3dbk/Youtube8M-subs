00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:11.790
 333.7 menotti in only 15.86 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 square kilometers one of the best 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.510
 energy ratios generated by area 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.430
 flooded the world enough energy 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.820
 to supply a city with more than 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.680
 800 thousand inhabitants 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 the hydroelectric 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.150
 was built on the rio paraíba 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.700
 from the south on the border of the mine states 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 general and rio de janeiro a great 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 challenge of furnas engineering 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.020
 the enterprise is composed of two 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.200
 Anta and Simplício plants and circuit 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.840
 hydraulics of 30 kilometers long 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.600
 containing 10 dikes 15 channels and seven 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 tunnels leading part of the river flow 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.550
 for the generation of clean and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.059
 renewable 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 in the hydroelectric sector 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.719
 h is to present a drop Simplício 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.380
 unique landmark for the history of furnas 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.380
 and from Brazil a water plant 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.500
 the simplicity complex begins with the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.300
 Southern Paraiba River Bus 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.360
 power plant where they are being 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.600
 installed two 14 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.550
 megawatts each 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.410
 in respect to the environment furnas 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.450
 created the system of transposition of 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.360
 fish to ensure the procreation of 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:37.440
 native species 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.440
 This is the project at the beginning hs each 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.519
 ae 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.260
 after a tour of 30 kilometers 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.920
 We arrived at the simple plant so 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:49.030
 another mill of the furnas complex that 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:55.020
 will ensure 100% clean energy 100% 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.020
 renewable 100% Brazilian
