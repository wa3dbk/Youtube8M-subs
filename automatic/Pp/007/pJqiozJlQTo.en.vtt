00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:17.060
 Matsumoto is Tsuyoshi of Riapuru occupational therapist at 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:20.840
 This time , after the iliac and lumbar muscles have become hard because of rehearsal videos and back pain 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.800
 What kind of stretching do you really want or 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 When I want to check if it has become hard 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 How to test 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.539
 I think So first want to describe your 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.539
 Lie down 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:45.950
 In this way , the opposite leg to the one you want to test lying down 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.810
 You can buy the effect yourself 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:55.160
 Of this kind of bone iliopsoas muscle 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.600
 Though it is stretching and test of Kyoko 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.560
 First of all it is a test 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.140
 Lift your feet 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.600
 This knee is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.440
 Got to reach your body 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.990
 Bend 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.240
 When this happens 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.659
 The opposite leg of the person you want to with this side to extinguish the knee bends and Gu' 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.200
 When exiting symptoms Do not say Ochia want 9 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.050
 It is suspected of shortening of the intestines psoas muscle 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.880
 And 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.340
 Here 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.689
 Opened outside 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:37.119
 Here is a test of the large lumbar muscle, but in this condition the opposite leg when bending the leg again 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.400
 But the knees lift up 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.760
 At this time 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.810
 Of the lumbar muscles out of the super container 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.479
 Shorting is suspected 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 Or felt that I wish has been hard at even Well your not caught in these tests 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.080
 If you care about the attitude a little 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.080
 I recommend the stretch 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.810
 Or Toshimashite stretch of way 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:08.940
 In this way, hold the foot opposite to the one you want to extend 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:14.400
 At this time, the upper knees are kept by themselves and the lower ones too 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.180
 Because it takes a good deal on the knee when you hold the knee, it will be a burden on the knee 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:28.349
 It feels like holding a little higher up and pressing it against my chest 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:33.870
 The foot here If you want to extend this at the six floor was much put a force on the ass of a portion of the foot 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:37.130
 Try to press and at this time the ankle's power is 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 Leave it out 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:49.380
 Pressing and Gu' to was either of the foot all the way while pressing the opposite foot in here. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.560
 Put your strength in the buttocks and pull off the ankle 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.540
 About 30 seconds in this state 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.020
 While breathing with my own power 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.530
 Please for 30 seconds while exhaling deep breath 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:09.860
 And now I mainly stretch the iliac muscles 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:14.650
 Also in the state next you open a foot in the transverse 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:21.299
 Pressed against was here of foot while all the time bending the legs 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.299
 In this state, another 30 seconds here is a stretch mainly on the lumbar muscles 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:39.830
 The above is how to test and stretch the iliopsoas muscle 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:44.000
 Those who felt it has become hard and I think you'll all means try 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:48.050
 Then in the next video 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.549
 The work is weak The muscle power is weak 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:55.850
 Or not working too much 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:59.200
 I would like to describe your because if it is cause of and become 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.200
