minutes and the software will be back to
the<00:00:53.470> way<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.590> was<00:00:53.950> when<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:54.400> powered<00:00:54.850> on<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.000> PC

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
the way it was when I powered on a PC

the way it was when I powered on a PC
for<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.050> very<00:00:56.200> first<00:00:56.440> time<00:00:59.579> in<00:01:00.579> most<00:01:00.760> cases

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
for the very first time in most cases

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.360

and<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:01.540> I'm<00:01:01.630> trying<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.960> fix<00:01:02.079> my<00:01:02.140> PC<00:01:02.650> I'm<00:01:02.920> not

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
and if I'm trying to fix my PC I'm not

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.639 
and if I'm trying to fix my PC I'm not
gonna<00:01:03.520> want<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.730> lose<00:01:03.880> my<00:01:04.030> data<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.629> this<00:01:05.470> is

gonna want to lose my data and this is

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.830 
gonna want to lose my data and this is
when<00:01:05.860> I'm<00:01:06.009> going<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.750> refresh<00:01:07.750> my<00:01:07.960> PC<00:01:08.380> instead

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
when I'm going to refresh my PC instead

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.950 
when I'm going to refresh my PC instead
this<00:01:10.840> will<00:01:10.899> reinstall<00:01:11.649> windows<00:01:12.509> but<00:01:13.509> keep<00:01:13.750> my

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
this will reinstall windows but keep my

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.280 
this will reinstall windows but keep my
personal<00:01:14.380> files<00:01:14.860> user<00:01:15.520> accounts<00:01:16.290> metro-style

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.930 

the<00:01:27.590> whole<00:01:27.740> process<00:01:27.979> takes<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.760> few

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
the whole process takes just a few

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.550 
the whole process takes just a few
minutes<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.420> can<00:01:29.600> be<00:01:29.690> pretty<00:01:29.930> handy<00:01:30.170> when

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
minutes and can be pretty handy when

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.740 
minutes and can be pretty handy when
helping<00:01:30.860> others<00:01:31.100> with<00:01:31.280> their<00:01:31.340> PCs<00:01:31.850> especially

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
helping others with their PCs especially

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.210 
helping others with their PCs especially
since<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.049> doesn't<00:01:33.200> require<00:01:33.530> backing<00:01:33.979> up<00:01:34.070> all

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
since it doesn't require backing up all

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.060 
since it doesn't require backing up all
the<00:01:34.549> data<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:35.240> another<00:01:35.420> drive<00:01:35.780> first<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.440> then

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the data to another drive first and then

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.910 
the data to another drive first and then
putting<00:01:37.340> them<00:01:37.430> back<00:01:37.520> later<00:01:37.760> as<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:39.740> see

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
putting them back later as we can see

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800 
putting them back later as we can see
here<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.280> my<00:01:40.850> metro-style<00:01:41.240> apps<00:01:41.479> are

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
here all my metro-style apps are

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.789 
here all my metro-style apps are
preserved

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.310 

and<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.460> can<00:01:51.579> also<00:01:51.729> see<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.299> my<00:01:52.810> data<00:01:53.020> are

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
and you can also see that my data are

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.910 
and you can also see that my data are
here<00:01:53.679> as<00:01:53.770> well

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
now when I get a new PC one of the first

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.050 
now when I get a new PC one of the first
things<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> usually<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.550> install<00:02:02.760> all

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
things I usually do is to install all

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.930 
things I usually do is to install all
the<00:02:03.180> desktop<00:02:03.570> apps<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.050> use<00:02:04.080> regularly

the desktop apps that I use regularly

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.540 
the desktop apps that I use regularly

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
but if i refresh my PC I would have to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.969 
but if i refresh my PC I would have to
reinstall<00:02:09.000> them<00:02:09.119> afterwards<00:02:09.860> when<00:02:10.860> those

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
reinstall them afterwards when those

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.770 
reinstall them afterwards when those
aids<00:02:11.190> actually<00:02:11.430> comes<00:02:11.820> with<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.060> utility<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
lets me create a baseline recovery image

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.750 
lets me create a baseline recovery image
of<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.209> PC<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.709> when<00:02:16.860> i<00:02:16.890> refresh<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.430> I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
of the PC so that when i refresh it I
