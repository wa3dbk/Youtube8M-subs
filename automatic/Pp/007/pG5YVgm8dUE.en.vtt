00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.090
 what's up, I bring you a new chapter of 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.400
 a series that I'm going to start the roa tube 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.710
 Diamond 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.780
 and to start the first weapon that I bring 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.980
 is the bcr as the sniper of all 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:38.570
 this is not called a series I'm going to bring 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.430
 a game when I get the gold in 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.260
 each sniper one game with each 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.440
 one so the next one that pulls me out 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.699
 I will bring another game and so on 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.760
 surely the next weapon that brings 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.800
 it's that egg is a sniper 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.220
 terrible the truth to get me the euro 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.019
 I'm playing now in the extreme for 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.059
 to be able to take casualties out of a shot and that 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.460
 because fuck right now I have more or 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.290
 minus 200 casualties of a shot in the that 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.470
 egg so inside the game I think 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.909
 that I'll get the camouflage out of now 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.159
 then bring the ballista who does not 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.640
 nationalist as what I call him 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 guarantor 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.360
 what is a sniper that did not give me 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
 like but it's been a long time marker 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.050
 that does not usually use much to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 beginning when when I'm not going to play 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.570
 the game thought it was a style 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.250
 besides golf to 3 when I try 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.940
 here with emotions concacaf and besides already 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.130
 mark and diagonal that of that ere 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.320
 and then comes the way it's called x 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.119
 pr that at the beginning of the game I thought 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.759
 it was good and that I will ever 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.960
 I said because the classes come to you like 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.640
 they are called the classes of these people 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.820
 they are made when you can not create yourself 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.130
 I caught him and manu and killed him 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.229
 shot and that I say fuck what good but 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.020
 now I that is still with the part this 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.819
 committed because the doctor gave me the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.440
 impression of that but right now 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.869
 We are where I was testing a 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.640
 poquillo to take some casualties and not 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.500
 I really like the good truth now 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.050
 talking a bit about the game in the dsr 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 I was wearing the laser sight and the charger 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.530
 expanded and then gusts the attack 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.420
 lightning the sentinel ice is good 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.890
 upload another video that happened to me one thing a 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.110
 little strange with him what to be already what 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.819
 you will see also say walk the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.799
 sniper I'm not very good at 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.590
 you will see in the video but good so 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.450
 least I can have a bit of what 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.799
 I think I do not get to get out but 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.360
 I also do not know why I put it on because 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.100
 with the sniper I do not know 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:37.150
 but the lightning attack and the sentinel 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.860
 of saco, I do not care 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.750
 nothing I hope you like the video os 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.750
