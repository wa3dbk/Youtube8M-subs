00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.250
 good good good what is android is the planet earth today in the viera more than 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.629
 15 acts we are going to teach the differences between two is more the ones that 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.039
 they are giving a lot of talk 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.579
 they both come from a very good family, specifically from htc 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.519
 and both have an open source operating system that offers mountains of 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.550
 Applications 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.820
 and that is driven by the very and all powerful 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.710
 so let's go with it 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.480
 ladies and gentlemen in the corner on the right with black pants and 158 grams 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.630
 of weight 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.450
 the htc of the movistar imdere 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.510
 i in the corner on the left with white pants and I feel 18 point five 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.030
 grams of weight 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.940
 the htc madrid d 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 vodafone 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.140
 but before seeing the differences we will see what they have in common 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.020
 obviously the first thing that this operating system has in common 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.510
 the android 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.480
 what the htc magic integrates the last batch of the same 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 the so-called Katy 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.390
 in both cases it has the qualcomm processor and a balanced screen 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 Capacitive touch of 3 as 2 inches 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.290
 st lgd 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.770
 with 320 by 480 pixels resolution 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.240
 they also share the hspa cellular connection 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 up to seven megabits commands per second of your life 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 efe up to 2 megabits per second 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.220
 down 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 but of course those speeds as it happens with the rest of the smartphones 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.370
 are the slogans if you're on the subject of the antenna 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.350
 and already 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.479
 you can use them as a 3g modem 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.509
 8 as josh powell that to connect several devices but of course for that 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.500
 You have to run a little bit with integrated GPS receiver 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.079
 with google maps this guy the hatillo 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.320
 as they showed the other day more 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.610
 the two zero point workouts very city and mini or sd connections in the apart 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 down 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.650
 so you can connect 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.530
 these headphones can be synchronized with the computer 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.160
 honestly you can not load 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.310
 We would have loved it if you visit, gone with an essien since 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.100
 Independent 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.589
 to have put the headphones that we liked 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.499
 both the one and the other reproduce the most extended music formats 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.660
 and emilio reproduce mt 4 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.189
 and 3gp 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.369
 they also have a great integration with youtube 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.269
 and in the two who do that atc android market where you can download 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.219
 thousands of applications to customize your android 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.040
 until iker squares to equal but if we look more closely we will discover their 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.040
 differences 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.219
 the madrid has 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:41.019
 this pretty I tried badly around here and these six buttons around for all the 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.419
 functions 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:43.889
 but nevertheless 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.409
 the ring has the same bad but only five buttons and with different 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.889
 provision 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.879
 but yes the 20n 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.519
 down here 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.300
 full five-line keyboard 5 full 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.429
 of letters and numbers 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.349
 this time it is very easy and very productive 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.209
 is the base to use then to write email or also if you are 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.139
 daily giving on the key 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.999
 the madrid on the other hand 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.769
 is defined with a virtual keyboard like this one that manages but not the same 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.610
 and from behind we find the cameras 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.899
 are details like friend pixels and has auto focus 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.539
 what happens is that here we also have a difference 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:26.779
 and is that 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.699
 the ing is not able to record video and may and that yes it can 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.019
 everything like the perfect one for those who want as messi question and half 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.539
 once open we will see what is the potential of your batteries 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.849
 the times and not because this one 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.010
 apparently it has to have more autonomy because it seems bigger 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.099
 but no 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.929
 because they are here is more chubby the difference thousand 150 million orders 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.679
 for good i - 340 for the magic 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.609
 this in theory would only accept 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.539
 in the duration of the battery in the waiting time 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.409
 but if you put a lot of sugar at the time, only the battery is left 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.419
 in less than a day we have already said at the outset to 158 branches a 40% 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.419
 plus the magic of 118 with five 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.750
 This difference is above all because of course this clear message and for those who 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.009
 they want to declare to put it is very useful although weigh a little more 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.249
 and he knows 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:23.990
 in what is a little bit fatter 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.849
 and what is a bit longer 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.909
 although the truth is that you will not notice much of the difference if we do not put 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:31.300
 facing 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.330
 the conclusion is that the dimmer is the most battle team thanks to his 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.379
 physical keyboard 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:40.389
 and Madrid is a team because other design in multimedia but the 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.899
 truth is that the two are perfectly defined in the opposite field the 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:46.090
 edil estrada on the street end of april 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.460
 for a price between 0 and 229 euros with a mandatory contract and stay of 24 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.599
 months 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.680
 the rates will be at least 10 euros of internet connection and 9 euros 

00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:01.559
 net for its part the magic still has no price but more or less walk 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.010
 the goal up euro down 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.789
 similar to din 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.259
 i its launch 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.840
 is predicted for within a few weeks possibly 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.840
 before the end of May 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.599
 Finally if you lose that if you want to know more about this or anything else 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.789
 that has to do with digital lifestyle and you know that you miss 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.639
 because that point net 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.419
 until next time
