00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.510 
the only real weak link in the entire
game<00:04:37.880> but<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.650> game<00:04:39.830> like<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.400> voice

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.300 
game but in a game like this the voice
acting<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.180> not<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:42.080> priority<00:04:42.350> this<00:04:42.980> isn't<00:04:43.250> a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310
