00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:15.789 

start<00:00:03.409> from<00:00:04.160> start<00:00:14.019> this<00:00:15.019> thing<00:00:15.200> starts<00:00:15.559> up<00:00:15.679> in

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
start from start this thing starts up in

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.609 
start from start this thing starts up in
a<00:00:15.860> bit<00:00:16.040> what<00:00:16.550> then<00:00:16.960> I've<00:00:17.960> no<00:00:18.230> idea<00:00:18.289> why<00:00:18.560> it

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
a bit what then I've no idea why it

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.290 
a bit what then I've no idea why it
stopped<00:00:18.949> man<00:00:19.430> that's<00:00:19.970> something

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
stopped man that's something

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.390 
stopped man that's something
so<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.990> put<00:00:22.170> people<00:00:22.349> on<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.740> obviously<00:00:23.160> can

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
so you put people on that obviously can

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.800 
so you put people on that obviously can
go<00:00:23.519> slower<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.669> have<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> sign<00:00:27.210> like

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
go slower so if you have a sign like

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.779 
go slower so if you have a sign like
advertising<00:00:28.289> people<00:00:28.800> go<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.160> there<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.669> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
advertising people go in there this is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.009 
advertising people go in there this is
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.060> slow<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.509> steady<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:30.989> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
going to go slow and steady like a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.299 
going to go slow and steady like a
teacup<00:00:31.619> ride<00:00:34.610> out<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.930> bins<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.680> like

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
teacup ride out the bins around I like

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.040 
teacup ride out the bins around I like
brings<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> then

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
brings it down here like that and then

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.270 
brings it down here like that and then
there's<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.470> be<00:00:40.530> something<00:00:40.769> here<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
there's going to be something here that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.720 
there's going to be something here that
just<00:00:41.400> drops<00:00:44.420> wanna<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.839> end

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:01:04.620 

oh<00:00:51.170> my<00:00:52.170> god<00:00:55.129> put<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:57.170> also<00:00:58.170> that

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.950 

this<00:01:05.630> right<00:01:06.110> here<00:01:06.409> it's<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.340> k<00:01:07.580> drive<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.300> this

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
this right here it's a k drive and this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.170 
this right here it's a k drive and this
is<00:01:09.260> a<00:01:09.909> spinning<00:01:10.909> wheel<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:11.210> death<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:13.180> by

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
is a spinning wheel of death and by

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.499 
is a spinning wheel of death and by
activating<00:01:15.110> this<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.130> saying<00:01:16.909> yeah<00:01:19.509> we'll

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
activating this and saying yeah we'll

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.620 
activating this and saying yeah we'll
come<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.110> then<00:01:21.680> by<00:01:21.920> touching<00:01:22.190> is<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:23.240> Walter

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
come and then by touching is this Walter

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:33.710 
come and then by touching is this Walter
ally<00:01:24.009> go<00:01:25.300> yeah<00:01:29.259> turning

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.300 

and<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.440> this<00:01:34.560> turn<00:01:34.860> backwards

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
and then this turn backwards

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.340 
and then this turn backwards
wafer<00:01:38.240> here<00:01:38.720> on<00:01:40.000> now<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:41.600> 30<00:01:41.840> seconds

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
wafer here on now just for 30 seconds

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.600 
wafer here on now just for 30 seconds
both<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.280> what<00:01:43.460> people<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:44.979> ok<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.039> this<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.460> our

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
both to what people on ok so this is our

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.230 
both to what people on ok so this is our
music<00:01:47.060> art<00:01:47.270> project<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:48.409> we<00:01:48.530> built<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.240> we

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
music art project that we built and we

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.179 
music art project that we built and we
plan<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.630> build<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.990> spinny<00:01:51.289> back<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.920> spinny

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
plan to build a spinny back to spinny

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.859 
plan to build a spinny back to spinny
rides<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.789> something<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.210> involves<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.689> gear

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
rides and something that involves a gear

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.160 
rides and something that involves a gear
ball<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:55.549> some<00:01:55.880> problems<00:01:56.179> we<00:01:56.659> encountered

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
ball and some problems we encountered

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.950 
ball and some problems we encountered
we're<00:01:57.380> making<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.100> gear<00:01:58.429> wall<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.780> base

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
we're making this gear wall and the base

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.990 
we're making this gear wall and the base
of<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.380> ride<00:02:00.649> stable<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.549> keeping<00:02:01.880> these

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
of this ride stable and keeping these

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.669 
of this ride stable and keeping these
wires<00:02:02.299> from<00:02:02.570> getting<00:02:02.810> tangled<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:03.619> the

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
wires from getting tangled with the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.370 
wires from getting tangled with the
rides<00:02:04.030> if<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.210> had<00:02:05.299> more<00:02:05.479> time<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.869> our<00:02:05.990> project

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
rides if we had more time on our project

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.539 
rides if we had more time on our project
will<00:02:06.530> probably<00:02:06.860> make<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.100> right<00:02:07.369> move

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
will probably make this right move

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.719 
will probably make this right move
stable<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.269> like<00:02:09.019> more<00:02:09.920> connect<00:02:10.250> pieces<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.700> a

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
stable and like more connect pieces on a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.430 
stable and like more connect pieces on a
small<00:02:16.390> thing<00:02:17.390> starts<00:02:17.690> better<00:02:17.900> take<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.140> off

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
small thing starts better take it off

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.320 
small thing starts better take it off
and<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.100> we<00:02:19.340> push<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.760> touchdowns<00:02:20.180> this

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and then we push the touchdowns this

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.420 
and then we push the touchdowns this
year<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.989> then<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.290> are<00:02:21.410> stopped<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
year and then we are stopped and it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.620 
year and then we are stopped and it
stopped<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.239> this<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.930> system<00:02:24.290> going

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.510 

this<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.750> sweet<00:02:30.080> ride<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.660> add<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:34.190> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
this is a sweet ride and add this and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.260 
this is a sweet ride and add this and
the<00:02:35.360> link<00:02:35.630> Center<00:02:35.870> starts<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:37.220> sounds<00:02:38.150> is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
the link Center starts it the sounds is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.560 
the link Center starts it the sounds is
Rick<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.750> go<00:02:38.900> faster<00:02:39.350> than<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> touch<00:02:39.770> sensor

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
Rick to go faster than the touch sensor

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:51.400 
Rick to go faster than the touch sensor
tops<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:12.819 

stick<00:02:52.130> fast

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.809 

there's<00:03:13.829> going<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.069> something<00:03:14.280> here<00:03:14.430> that

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
there's going to be something here that

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.530 
there's going to be something here that
just<00:03:17.930> let<00:03:18.930> me<00:03:18.989> get<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.379> end
