when<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:40.970> works<00:02:41.120> together<00:02:41.530> I've

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
when it's all works together I've

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.190 
when it's all works together I've
greased<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.190> baking<00:02:43.549> tray<00:02:43.730> with<00:02:44.120> margarine<00:02:44.959> you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
greased a baking tray with margarine you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.770 
greased a baking tray with margarine you
can<00:02:45.349> use<00:02:45.440> butter<00:02:45.709> or<00:02:45.829> cooking<00:02:46.280> spray<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:47.390> can

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
can use butter or cooking spray we can

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.559 
can use butter or cooking spray we can
use<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:48.950> bacon<00:02:49.400> pay<00:02:49.579> paper<00:02:50.090> body<00:02:50.360> for

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
use you know bacon pay paper body for

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.830 
use you know bacon pay paper body for
you<00:02:50.690> normally<00:02:51.140> do<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.590> I'm<00:02:52.220> going<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:53.000> make

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
you normally do and I'm going to make

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.289 
you normally do and I'm going to make
them<00:02:53.989> into<00:02:54.230> balls<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.920> using<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.850> better<00:02:56.030> table

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
them into balls and using a better table

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.360 
them into balls and using a better table
spoons<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:57.079> thought<00:02:57.440> each<00:02:57.620> or<00:02:57.889> then<00:02:58.250> I'm

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
spoons with thought each or then I'm

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.300 
spoons with thought each or then I'm
going<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.549> flatten<00:02:58.790> them<00:02:59.030> with<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> fork<00:03:00.310> so

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
going to flatten them with a fork so

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.370 
going to flatten them with a fork so
there's<00:03:01.609> all<00:03:01.819> set<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.209> go<00:03:02.329> into<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.660> oven<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
there's all set to go into the oven and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.099 
there's all set to go into the oven and
neighbors<00:03:03.829> have<00:03:03.980> decided<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.989> with

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
neighbors have decided to do that with

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.199 
neighbors have decided to do that with
power<00:03:06.350> tools<00:03:06.620> outside<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.430> don't<00:03:07.639> know<00:03:07.700> why<00:03:07.880> and

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
power tools outside I don't know why and

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.569 
power tools outside I don't know why and
yeah<00:03:08.959> they<00:03:09.410> ended<00:03:09.769> up<00:03:09.829> being<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.160> little<00:03:10.430> bit

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
yeah they ended up being a little bit

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:11.860 
yeah they ended up being a little bit
bigger<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.000> probably<00:03:11.389> more<00:03:11.660> like<00:03:11.840> a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
bigger that probably more like a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.410 
bigger that probably more like a
tablespoon<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.889> half<00:03:12.920> H<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.970> sled<00:03:14.299> in

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
tablespoon and a half H and I sled in

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.050 
tablespoon and a half H and I sled in
them<00:03:14.569> with<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> fork<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:16.280> am<00:03:16.519> going<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.880> break

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
them with a fork and I am going to break

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.520 
them with a fork and I am going to break
them<00:03:17.269> at<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.540> hundred<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.200> eighty<00:03:18.410> degrees

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
them at a hundred and eighty degrees

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.800 
them at a hundred and eighty degrees
Celsius<00:03:19.519> for<00:03:19.850> about<00:03:20.540> ten<00:03:21.260> minutes<00:03:22.810> basically

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
Celsius for about ten minutes basically

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.330 
Celsius for about ten minutes basically
you<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:23.989> they're<00:03:24.170> done<00:03:24.410> when<00:03:24.739> they<00:03:24.920> start<00:03:25.220> to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
you know they're done when they start to

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.979 
you know they're done when they start to
turn<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.549> little<00:03:25.790> bit<00:03:25.970> golden<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.750> I'm<00:03:26.900> just

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
turn a little bit golden so I'm just

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.770 
turn a little bit golden so I'm just
going<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.200> put<00:03:27.260> those<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.769> oven<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.780> take

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
going to put those in the oven and take

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.560 
going to put those in the oven and take
them<00:03:29.930> out<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.079> two<00:03:30.350> minutes
