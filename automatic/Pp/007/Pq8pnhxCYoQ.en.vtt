00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
spawning recent support and then running

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.630

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
and then going assault because in my

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.500 
and then going assault because in my
opinion<00:02:29.769> assault<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.550> best<00:02:30.819> class<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.269> use

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
opinion assault is the best class to use

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.600 
opinion assault is the best class to use
mainly<00:02:32.260> because<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.739> have<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.950> D<00:02:33.099> fibs<00:02:33.400> if

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
mainly because you have the D fibs if

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.880 
mainly because you have the D fibs if
you<00:02:33.760> revive<00:02:34.330> somebody<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.050> 100<00:02:35.560> points

one of the reasons why you're gonna want
to<00:03:42.400> do<00:03:42.549> this<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.910> because<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.900> will

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
to do this is because you will

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.229 
to do this is because you will
accumulate<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.889> massive<00:03:45.639> amount<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.880> points<00:03:46.060> in

accumulate a massive amount of points in
my<00:03:46.420> opinion<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.109> accumulate<00:03:47.440> more<00:03:47.709> than<00:03:47.889> you

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
my opinion you accumulate more than you

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.420 
my opinion you accumulate more than you
would<00:03:48.069> in<00:03:48.280> any<00:03:48.400> op<00:03:48.639> metro<00:03:49.030> game<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:50.430> differs
