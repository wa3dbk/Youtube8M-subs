00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
spinning the ball around the green I
started<00:00:38.760> thinking<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.899> was

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

you're a beginner even if you're
slightly<00:00:46.770> an<00:00:47.070> intermediate<00:00:47.730> golfer<00:00:48.270> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
slightly an intermediate golfer that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.410 
slightly an intermediate golfer that
would<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.350> main<00:00:49.590> concern<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.270> have

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.359 
ball comes from your angle of attack so
when<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.869> swing<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.680> it's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
when you think about your swing and it's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.719 
when you think about your swing and it's
a<00:01:39.290> it's<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.729> wide<00:01:42.470> half<00:01:43.470> circle<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.220> when

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a it's a wide half circle like this when

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.810 
a it's a wide half circle like this when
you<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.180> able<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.110> spin<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> ball<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.399> angle

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
you are able to spin the ball your angle

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630 
you are able to spin the ball your angle
of<00:01:47.880> attack<00:01:47.970> becomes<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.810> lot<00:01:48.960> more<00:01:49.020> steep<00:01:49.710> from

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
of attack becomes a lot more steep from

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.120 
of attack becomes a lot more steep from
the<00:01:51.299> top<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.780> backswing<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.590> into<00:01:53.040> your

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the top of your backswing down into your

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.209 
the top of your backswing down into your
golf<00:01:53.399> ball<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
golf ball and so that's kind of what you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.010 
golf ball and so that's kind of what you
want<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> do<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.270> ahead<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.570> practice

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
want to do you can go ahead and practice

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
want to do you can go ahead and practice

game i don't know if i would really work
on<00:02:10.110> trying<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.709> spin<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> ball<00:02:11.459> when<00:02:12.120> you're

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
on trying to spin the ball when you're

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.820 
on trying to spin the ball when you're
out<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.599> course<00:02:12.959> because<00:02:13.170> one<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
out on the course because one of the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.220 
out on the course because one of the
one<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> side<00:02:15.090> effects<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:15.990> do

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
one of the side effects if you don't do

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.050 
one of the side effects if you don't do
it<00:02:16.380> correctly<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.280> are<00:02:17.640> probably

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
it correctly is that you are probably

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.850 
it correctly is that you are probably
going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> end<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.960> then<00:02:19.200> hitting<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> ball

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
going to end up then hitting the ball

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.940 
going to end up then hitting the ball
very<00:02:19.890> thin<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.390> coming<00:02:21.990> down<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.200> top<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
very thin and coming down on top of the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.030 
very thin and coming down on top of the
ball<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.270> would<00:02:24.570> be<00:02:24.690> apprehensive<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.740> say

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
ball so I would be apprehensive to say

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.060 
ball so I would be apprehensive to say
go<00:02:26.430> out<00:02:26.610> there<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> try<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.590> perfect

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
go out there and try it and and perfect

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.930 
go out there and try it and and perfect
it<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:30.390> around<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.440> green

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
it and do it now around the green

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.790 
it and do it now around the green
spinning<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> ball<00:02:33.240> has<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> lot<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.590> do<00:02:34.770> with

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
spinning the ball has a lot to do with

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.610 
spinning the ball has a lot to do with
the<00:02:35.130> club<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.850> club<00:02:36.150> selection<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.080> not

only your club selection from your bag

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.670 
only your club selection from your bag
but<00:02:39.570> what<00:02:39.750> clubs<00:02:40.020> you're<00:02:40.170> putting<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.620> your

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
it's going to put spin on the ball so

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.440 
it's going to put spin on the ball so
you<00:03:40.500> will<00:03:40.890> see<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> spinning<00:03:41.640> motion<00:03:41.910> when

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
you will see a spinning motion when

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.140 
you will see a spinning motion when
you're<00:03:42.630> around<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.800> padding<00:03:44.400> around<00:03:44.610> the
