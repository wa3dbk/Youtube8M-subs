00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
as well this is and you've got to be

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.400 
as well this is and you've got to be
very<00:03:12.610> careful<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:13.090> greenery<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:13.930> it's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
very careful with greenery because it's

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.030

very slender on one level you sort of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.820 
very slender on one level you sort of
think<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.030> might<00:03:25.180> be<00:03:25.209> laudable<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.709> at

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
think it might be laudable because at

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.259 
think it might be laudable because at

we still have in this country where
people<00:03:53.980> think<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.459> benign<00:03:54.640> but<00:03:54.820> it's<00:03:54.940> not

people think it's benign but it's not

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.180 
people think it's benign but it's not
it's<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.480> noxious<00:03:55.780> institution<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.769> monarchy

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
it's a noxious institution the monarchy

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.300 
it's a noxious institution the monarchy
and<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.030> aristocracy<00:03:58.870> it's<00:03:59.769> all<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.190> know

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
and the aristocracy it's all you know

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.280 
and the aristocracy it's all you know
flummery<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.940> ceremonial<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.690> represents<00:04:02.170> is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
flummery and ceremonial it represents is

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.199 
flummery and ceremonial it represents is
actually<00:04:02.620> quite<00:04:02.860> quite<00:04:03.340> quite<00:04:03.610> poisonous

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
actually quite quite quite poisonous

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.660 
actually quite quite quite poisonous
perhaps<00:04:05.049> it's<00:04:05.230> our<00:04:05.350> national<00:04:05.799> self<00:04:06.040> images<00:04:06.519> to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
perhaps it's our national self images to

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.580 
perhaps it's our national self images to
sort<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:06.940> drain<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.510> their<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.840> go<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.049> it's<00:04:08.470> a

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
sort of drain on their to go to it's a

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.350 
sort of drain on their to go to it's a
burden<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:09.100> think<00:04:09.310> we<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.030> bear<00:04:10.209> the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
burden I think we have to bear the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.759 
burden I think we have to bear the
