00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
what's up YouTube my 8 to 10 at startup

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.860 
what's up YouTube my 8 to 10 at startup
such<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.460> programs<00:00:11.790> like<00:00:11.910> Dropbox<00:00:12.389> or<00:00:12.570> Skype

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
such as programs like Dropbox or Skype

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480 
such as programs like Dropbox or Skype
you<00:00:13.230> know<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.219> that's<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
you know they do that but that's a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.220 
you know they do that but that's a
program<00:00:14.730> type<00:00:15.120> thing<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.660> it's

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
program type thing and it's

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.140 
program type thing and it's
automatically<00:00:16.740> set<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.369> there's<00:00:17.970> any

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
automatically set to that there's any

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.429 
automatically set to that there's any
sort<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.420> program<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.869> does<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.170> either

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
sort of program that does not either

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.109 
sort of program that does not either
have<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> option<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.789> does<00:00:20.970> not

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
have the option or does not

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.090 
have the option or does not
automatically<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.439> will<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> way

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
automatically do this this will be a way

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
automatically do this this will be a way
to<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.939> won't<00:00:24.090> work<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.449> every<00:00:24.630> program

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
to do it it won't work for every program

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.480 
to do it it won't work for every program
it<00:00:25.170> might<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.439> work<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:26.010> portable

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it might not work for some portable

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.970 
it might not work for some portable
programs<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.230> case<00:00:28.439> I'll<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.680> be

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
programs but in this case I'll just be

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
programs but in this case I'll just be
using<00:00:29.130> ringing<00:00:29.640> meters<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.599> should<00:00:31.080> work

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
using ringing meters so it should work

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.959 
using ringing meters so it should work
for<00:00:31.529> most<00:00:31.710> programs<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> doesn't<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.850> not

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
for most programs if it doesn't it's not

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.940 
for most programs if it doesn't it's not
my<00:00:33.120> fault<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> want<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
my fault so what you want to do just to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.150 
my fault so what you want to do just to
make<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.460> simpler<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.649> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.800> start

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
make this much simpler is going to start

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.229 
make this much simpler is going to start
all<00:00:39.000> programs<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:40.550> then<00:00:41.550> scroll<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> way

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
all programs and then scroll all the way

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
all programs and then scroll all the way
down<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.899> startup<00:00:43.649> folder<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.040> open<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
down to startup folder and open it up I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
down to startup folder and open it up I
think<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:45.690> work<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> Windows<00:00:46.170> XP<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
think this will work on Windows XP I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.290 
think this will work on Windows XP I
know<00:00:46.620> it'll<00:00:46.890> work<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.160> Vista<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.579> 7<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
know it'll work on Vista and 7 so you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
know it'll work on Vista and 7 so you
can<00:00:48.510> tell<00:00:48.780> me<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> works<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.410> Windows<00:00:49.469> XP

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
can tell me if it works on Windows XP

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
can tell me if it works on Windows XP
just<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.449> should<00:00:51.629> work<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> same<00:00:52.199> way

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
just I think it should work the same way

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
just I think it should work the same way
alright<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.340> you've<00:00:53.640> done<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
alright now that you've done that go to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.350 
alright now that you've done that go to
the<00:00:54.690> folder<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.260> find<00:00:56.129> me<00:00:56.280> XE<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> want

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the folder and find me XE that you want

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.250 
the folder and find me XE that you want

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
create a copy of it or a shortcut or you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
create a copy of it or a shortcut or you
could<00:01:07.229> right-click<00:01:07.439> shortcut<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.280> desktop

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
could right-click shortcut your desktop

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
could right-click shortcut your desktop
then<00:01:08.850> drag<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> easier<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
make a little copy as you can still see

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
make a little copy as you can still see
or<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.880> Rainier<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> still

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

I try my computer a trainer will

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.850 
I try my computer a trainer will
automatically<00:01:34.890> start<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.869> on<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:37.229> account

automatically start in on my account

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
automatically start in on my account
it<00:01:37.979> shouldn't<00:01:38.520> start<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.880> under<00:01:39.090> accounts<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it shouldn't start on under accounts I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
it shouldn't start on under accounts I
have<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:40.079> issues<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> sometimes<00:01:41.369> but

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
have had issues with that sometimes but

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
have had issues with that sometimes but
then<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.570> went<00:01:42.750> into<00:01:42.930> steeped<00:01:43.259> cleaner<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
then I just went into steeped cleaner I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
then I just went into steeped cleaner I
turned<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.780> sure<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> can

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
turned that off you can I'm sure you can

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660
