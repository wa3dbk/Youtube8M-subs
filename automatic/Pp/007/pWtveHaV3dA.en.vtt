melbourne in union lane to introduce

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.290 
melbourne in union lane to introduce
another<00:00:16.470> product<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.100> i'm<00:00:17.580> being<00:00:17.910> careful

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
another product and i'm being careful

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.970 
another product and i'm being careful
not<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.570> lean<00:00:18.750> against<00:00:19.109> anything<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.650> cool<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
not to lean against anything as cool of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.830 
not to lean against anything as cool of
this<00:00:20.130> place<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.760> smelled<00:00:21.119> massively<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
this place is it smelled massively of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.509 
this place is it smelled massively of
Pierce<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.680> bathroom<00:00:23.070> when<00:00:23.369> it's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
Pierce I think it's a bathroom when it's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.050 
Pierce I think it's a bathroom when it's
not<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> graffiti<00:00:24.240> art<00:00:24.960> Center<00:00:25.609> today<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.730> wanted

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
not a graffiti art Center today I wanted

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.230 
not a graffiti art Center today I wanted
to<00:00:27.150> introduce<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.990> new<00:00:28.310> variable<00:00:29.310> neutral

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to introduce a new variable neutral

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900 
to introduce a new variable neutral
density<00:00:30.480> filter<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:31.439> Inca<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.130> personally

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
density filter from Inca I personally

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.130 
density filter from Inca I personally
had<00:00:33.000> never<00:00:33.210> seen<00:00:33.480> something<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.870> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
had never seen something like this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440 
had never seen something like this
before<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.890> baffled<00:00:35.520> me<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.880> exactly<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
before and it baffled me how exactly it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
before and it baffled me how exactly it
works<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.680> figure<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.100> there's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
works all I can figure is that there's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
works all I can figure is that there's
two<00:00:39.230> something<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.350> circular<00:00:40.680> polarizers

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
two something like circular polarizers

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540 
two something like circular polarizers
in<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.120> because<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.260> rotate<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
in there because as you rotate them the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
in there because as you rotate them the
amount<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.090> neutral<00:00:45.780> density<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.800> amount

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
amount of neutral density or the amount

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
amount of neutral density or the amount
of<00:00:47.070> light<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.670> stopping<00:00:47.940> increases<00:00:48.870> or

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
of light that it's stopping increases or

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.080 
of light that it's stopping increases or
decreases<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:50.219> whole<00:00:50.370> point<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> having<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
decreases the whole point of having a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
decreases the whole point of having a
neutral<00:00:51.420> density<00:00:51.449> filter<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
neutral density filter is that you can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.439 
neutral density filter is that you can
knock<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.879> amount<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> light<00:00:54.420> that's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
knock down the amount of light that's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
knock down the amount of light that's
coming<00:00:54.960> through<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.379> camera<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.010> for

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
coming through to your camera so for

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.790 
coming through to your camera so for
example<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.510> put<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.870> 1/4<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> neutral

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
example if you put on 1/4 of neutral

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.580 
example if you put on 1/4 of neutral
density<00:00:58.980> filter<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.239> takes<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.809> 4<00:01:01.050> stops<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
density filter it takes out 4 stops of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
density filter it takes out 4 stops of
light<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.010> Hobbs<00:01:02.280> Hobbs<00:01:02.609> Hobbs<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.480> Hobbs

again the amount of light coming through
there's<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> few<00:01:06.299> reason<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> might<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
there's a few reason you might want to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.929 
there's a few reason you might want to
do<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.549> bright

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
do that if it was really really bright

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.450 
do that if it was really really bright
and<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.570> want<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> shoot<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> high<00:01:10.890> F<00:01:11.159> not

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and you want to shoot at a high F not

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.300 
and you want to shoot at a high F not
like<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> fast<00:01:12.240> lens<00:01:12.869> number<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.500> say<00:01:13.650> one

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
like a fast lens number will say one

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.890 
like a fast lens number will say one
point<00:01:14.490> eight<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:15.119> four<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.720> just

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
point eight one point four and you just

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
point eight one point four and you just
can't<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> shutter<00:01:16.650> speed<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
can't get the shutter speed you need you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
can't get the shutter speed you need you
might<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> most<00:01:19.409> common

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
might use one then but the most common

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.469 
might use one then but the most common
purpose<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.330> shooting

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
purpose for them is when you're shooting

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
purpose for them is when you're shooting
landscapes<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> slow<00:01:23.189> down<00:01:23.220> or

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
landscapes and you want to slow down or

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
landscapes and you want to slow down or
any<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> photography<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
any kind of photography really and you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.450 
any kind of photography really and you
want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> slow<00:01:26.549> down<00:01:26.659> your<00:01:27.659> shutter<00:01:28.049> speed<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
want to slow down your shutter speed so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
want to slow down your shutter speed so
say<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> 10<00:01:30.659> second

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
say you want to you get a 10 second

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.429 
say you want to you get a 10 second
exposure<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> nice<00:01:33.439> movement

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
exposure so then you get a nice movement

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
exposure so then you get a nice movement
through<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.650> water<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.369> people<00:01:36.240> rushing<00:01:36.630> by

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
through the water or people rushing by

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390 
through the water or people rushing by
or<00:01:37.049> car<00:01:37.259> headlights<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.920> sort<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> thing

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
or car headlights that sort of thing

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
or car headlights that sort of thing

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
using neutral density filter lets less
light<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.060> longer

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
light in and then you can get longer

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
light in and then you can get longer
exposure<00:01:42.810> times<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.950> generally<00:01:44.220> come

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
exposure times and they generally come

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.719 
exposure times and they generally come
in<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.899> two<00:01:46.110> four<00:01:46.409> eight<00:01:46.729> variants

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
in you know one two four eight variants

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.460 
in you know one two four eight variants

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in the number of stops of light they're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.810

amount of neutral density power is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
amount of neutral density power is
pretty<00:02:09.899> amazing<00:02:10.200> let<00:02:10.590> me<00:02:10.679> show<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.920> how<00:02:11.070> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
pretty amazing let me show you how it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.060 
pretty amazing let me show you how it
works<00:02:11.370> okay<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.960> really<00:02:13.260> demonstrate<00:02:13.440> this

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
works okay to really demonstrate this

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.670 
works okay to really demonstrate this
let<00:02:14.460> me<00:02:14.490> show<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.110> here<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.260> go

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
let me show you here we go

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.060 
let me show you here we go
there<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.600> with<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.260> song<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.680> lower

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
there it is with that song that's lower

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.820 
there it is with that song that's lower
setting<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:21.960> how<00:02:22.320> much<00:02:22.530> light

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
setting so you can see how much light

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.320 
setting so you can see how much light
that<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.220> letting<00:02:23.400> through<00:02:23.640> there<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.120> put

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
that is letting through there if I put

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
that is letting through there if I put
it<00:02:24.420> against<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.810> white<00:02:25.020> background<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.280> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
it against a white background so if you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.780 
it against a white background so if you
are<00:02:26.670> watching<00:02:27.390> here<00:02:27.570> as<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.500> slowly<00:02:28.830> rotate<00:02:29.550> it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
are watching here as I slowly rotate it

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.890 
are watching here as I slowly rotate it
what<00:02:30.360> should<00:02:30.540> get<00:02:30.780> darker<00:02:32.630> no<00:02:33.630> trick

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
what should get darker no trick

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.400 
what should get darker no trick
photography<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.990> keep<00:02:37.170> rotating

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
photography there and as I keep rotating

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.400 
photography there and as I keep rotating
it<00:02:38.100> goes<00:02:38.850> back<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.270> lighter<00:02:39.510> again<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.080> mean

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
it goes back to lighter again I mean

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.280 
it goes back to lighter again I mean
it's<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:41.160> stuff<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.700> magicians<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:43.080> then

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
it's it's stuff of magicians but then

from Inca I'm impressed I need to get it

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.500 
from Inca I'm impressed I need to get it
back<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.350> take<00:03:01.650> more<00:03:01.890> sample<00:03:02.340> shots<00:03:02.610> look<00:03:03.390> at

back and take more sample shots look at

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.960 
back and take more sample shots look at

you<00:03:06.780> know<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.230> how<00:03:07.769> good<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.400> quality<00:03:08.580> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
you know just how good the quality of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.410 
you know just how good the quality of
the<00:03:09.030> actual<00:03:09.530> glass<00:03:10.530> elements<00:03:11.220> are<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:12.030> in

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the actual glass elements are but in

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
the actual glass elements are but in
terms<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.140> concept<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.830> how<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.310> could<00:03:14.519> be

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
terms of a concept and how it could be

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.280 
terms of a concept and how it could be
applied<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.269> photography<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:15.989> this

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
applied in your photography I think this

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.890 
applied in your photography I think this
has<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.709> great<00:03:16.980> potential<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.480> keep<00:03:18.750> an

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
has really great potential so keep an

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.060 
has really great potential so keep an
eye<00:03:19.019> out<00:03:19.049> for<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.590> they'll<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.799> available

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
eye out for it they'll be available

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.130 
eye out for it they'll be available
