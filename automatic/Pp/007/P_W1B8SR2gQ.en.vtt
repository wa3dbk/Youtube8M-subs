00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.990
 hi girls, i hope you are having 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.679
 a nice week you can have it already 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.660
 we have three weeks in this year is 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.880
 amazing how fast time goes by 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.180
 inside nothing valentine and then 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.150
 nothing is summer is incredible and 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.609
 that we have started work in the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.529
 university college institute 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.410
 thought that what better to give you three 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.150
 ideas for hairstyles that you can do 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.039
 in the mornings I know that in the mornings 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.660
 we are all running for 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.070
 other than if we put the clothes on 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.070
 shoes shower hair makeup 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.950
 I've thought of 623 ideas from three endings 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.350
 different that are super simple and 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.090
 quick to do in the morning os 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.160
 I would be doing you a favor for all 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.350
 those who have little imagination that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.300
 I am one of them in the end I finish 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.309
 doing the same thing because at the moment 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.199
 I do not remember what they really tell me 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.260
 the hairstyles is silly but good 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.350
 I want to give you these three ideas because if 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.879
 by some chance of life if you 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.590
 you remember for the mania that I have 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.540
 taught a hairstyle 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.720
 can you do that you can follow 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.730
 different to class or to work so 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.370
 that 's what I'm going to do three hairstyles 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.470
 different super singles and we're going to 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.300
 start for the first hairstyle we go to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.010
 take a lock of hair from the side of the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.530
 front and I like to take the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.270
 bangs we are going to roll them on themselves 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.910
 same and let's secure it with a 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.619
 fork we will do the same to the other 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.260
 side we take a lock of hair from 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.300
 front we roll it up on itself and what 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.780
 we insure the other side of the head with 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.780
 a fork 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.799
 once the two strands of hair are 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.569
 insured we are going to fix the part 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.789
 from the front and you can take out some 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.350
 tufts if you fancy or mess up a 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.950
 little bit more so that more is 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 complicated 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.370
 for hairstyle number 2 we're going to 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.960
 need two strands of the front of the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.630
 head but not bangs this time 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.610
 but from the part of the side we're going to 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.370
 take these two locks we are not going to 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.320
 pull back and let's tie them in a 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.570
 little bunny this is the end I wore 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.640
 the other day that you liked so much and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.740
 you said that I did a tutorial is very 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.300
 very easy the next thing we're going to do 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.970
 is to take a lock of hair from the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.910
 crown and add it to the other two 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.890
 millions we make a little bun or a 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.100
 pigtail as you like more and we have already 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.100
 finished 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.849
 ahead as always we can 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.549
 take a little bit of hair we can not 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.170
 mess up take out some strands and 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.340
 make the look in general is a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 little more descomplicado 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.080
 and for third hairstyle and the last one we go 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.340
 to need 32 little gummies what 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.430
 first thing we're going to do is take the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.980
 two strands of bangs and we're not going 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.900
 to give in the back and once 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.890
 is tied we are going to put it towards 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.840
 in as you can see in a second 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.370
 next we go with the second 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.470
 rubber band and we're going to do exactly what 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.240
 same we are going to take two more strands of 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.910
 hair from the front this time if from the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.459
 sideburns let's also take the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.170
 little piece of hair that we had before we go 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.270
 to make a half pigtail and we're going to 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.270
 introduce all the hair inwards 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.490
 and we go with the third rubber band and we're going to 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.340
 do exactly the same thing we take the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.230
 rest of the hair the whole queue we give it 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.230
 and we introduce it inwards 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.879
 we fix our hair in front and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.879
 as we like it more and we have finished 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.300
 as we have seen the hairstyles are very 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.480
 very easy to do maximum 3 minutes in 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.250
 make them really super fast plus 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.230
 you can make others with dirty hair 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.620
 because it is the collected hair you take it 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.760
 loose and hides a little hair or 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.320
 fatty or dirty if you have one more day of 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.080
 Take advantage of your hair before washing or flan 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.160
 labaros lock and what I've done just 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.680
 before you start making all 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.690
 Pillars is to put on a little shampoo 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.880
 dry to remove a little more than 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.250
 volume and take away the look of 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.540
 dirty hair and the truth is that they have 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.580
 appeared that the hairstyles 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.650
 super simple super fast pretty 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.360
 casual even if you have 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.820
 that dress a little bit more I think 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.770
 They look good and nothing I hope you have
