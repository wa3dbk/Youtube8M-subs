00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
makes a little bit slower which is nicer

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.980 
makes a little bit slower which is nicer
ok<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.110> next<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.740> going<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> go<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.070> design<00:03:23.990> and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
ok so next I'm going to go to design and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.930 
ok so next I'm going to go to design and
i'm<00:03:25.080> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.260> press<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.770> little<00:03:25.890> text<00:03:26.460> thing

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
there and i'm just going to drag that so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.600 
there and i'm just going to drag that so
i<00:03:29.910> can<00:03:30.180> put<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:31.050> my<00:03:31.110> water<00:03:31.770> watermark<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.610> it's

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
i can put on my water watermark so it's

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.250 
i can put on my water watermark so it's
not<00:03:35.820> showing<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.150> because<00:03:36.600> it's<00:03:36.780> only<00:03:36.990> on

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
not showing that because it's only on

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.010 
not showing that because it's only on
layer<00:03:37.530> 1<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> i'm<00:03:39.090> just<00:03:39.120> going<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.630> drag<00:03:39.960> this

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
layer 1 so i'm just going to drag this

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.729 
layer 1 so i'm just going to drag this
to<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:43.050> top<00:03:44.210> so<00:03:45.210> now<00:03:45.450> it'll<00:03:45.720> show<00:03:46.050> up<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.440> all

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
to the top so now it'll show up on all

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.390 
to the top so now it'll show up on all
my<00:03:46.770> friends<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.290> then<00:03:49.290> i'll<00:03:49.440> just<00:03:49.470> put<00:03:50.250> out

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
my friends and then i'll just put out

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.760 
my friends and then i'll just put out
where<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.580> wanted<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.940> go

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.220 

okay<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:59.580> that<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.450> just<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
okay so really that is just like the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.650 
okay so really that is just like the
basic<00:04:01.770> gift<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.459> don't<00:04:02.940> know<00:04:03.000> it's<00:04:03.180> really

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
basic gift I don't know it's really

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.630 
basic gift I don't know it's really
simple<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.050> mean<00:04:04.260> it'll<00:04:04.650> be<00:04:04.860> hard<00:04:05.100> at<00:04:05.190> first<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
simple I mean it'll be hard at first and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.280 
simple I mean it'll be hard at first and
it<00:04:05.730> will<00:04:05.819> take<00:04:05.970> kind<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.020> lot<00:04:07.200> of

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
it will take kind of like a lot of

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.559 
it will take kind of like a lot of
practice<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:07.920> it's<00:04:08.580> actually<00:04:08.760> really<00:04:09.240> really

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
practice but it's actually really really

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.390 
practice but it's actually really really
simple<00:04:09.870> once<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.230> kind<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.040> figure<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.310> how

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
simple once you kind of figure out how

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.550 
simple once you kind of figure out how
to<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.970> mean<00:04:12.870> like<00:04:12.989> there's<00:04:13.230> lots<00:04:13.440> of

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
to do it I mean like there's lots of

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
to do it I mean like there's lots of
