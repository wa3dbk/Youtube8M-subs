00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.170
 what on all this background 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.410
 something blue is going to be 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.770
 look rice washed further us 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:11.360
 need to eat in a box harvested 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:16.280
 weed means this weed glue I 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.600
 I use moment scissors square us 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 must be cut with sides of 20 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.610
 centimeters distant targets for 7 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.060
 centimeters 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.910
 don't you celebrate the glacier 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.470
 pencil it turns out we have 9 in 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.660
 squares and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.320
 we need to make cuts here 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.320
 from here 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.100
 side 1 square 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.370
 from the opposite side 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:06.400
 and now we need not like this 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.310
 entirely and so remained so 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.530
 small gap 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.209
 rather , these are the squares between 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.209
 we first need 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 to bend 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.800
 square and so that they are easier to keep 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.800
 form 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.780
 while our main part dries out 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.709
 constructions 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.380
 we need to glue a strip or 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.400
 braid already time you decide 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:55.020
 to the main handle of our basket at me 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.690
 on about half a centimeter stick 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.550
 her and the times of one side and on 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.840
 already pasted 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.840
 side here are these little squares 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.690
 such a picture we got ourselves 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.850
 now it is necessary to measure 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.920
 where we will have weed what it will be 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.630
 above the height and glue and sides 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.240
 Help from corrugated paper looks very 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.260
 Naturally, even if so slightly 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.650
 to play 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.640
 hands she will be pretty so 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.689
 stick around our little tartlet ready and now 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.089
 we need to fill our 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.089
 our operative weed 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.550
 we glue a little bird here 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.060
 but 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.040
 for magicians 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.879
 I also bought everything in the store 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.159
 houses 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:24.869
 Here is such a bunch of artificial 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.229
 little flowers I just cut them off 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:31.309
 and inflorescences 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:34.319
 such here are some turned twigs and 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:37.199
 I want to glue a little bit like this 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:40.619
 inside the grass so that it does not appear 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.839
 goals such flowers turned out the same 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:45.629
 the action itself is done by 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:49.669
 Here is such a wonderful little basket we have 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:51.589
 with you it turned out I decided to fill it 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:57.259
 sweetmeat 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:57.259
 our gift baskets are ready
