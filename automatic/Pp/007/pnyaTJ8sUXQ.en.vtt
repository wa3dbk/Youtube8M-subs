00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
you know both Chris Reeve knives but I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.770 
you know both Chris Reeve knives but I
do<00:01:05.640> miss<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> variety<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:10.130> grip

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
do miss the variety I I do like the grip

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
do miss the variety I I do like the grip
on<00:01:12.780> both<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.189> 21<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
on both of them but the 21 is kind of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.070 
on both of them but the 21 is kind of
feels<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.290> better<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.830> extended<00:01:17.310> uses

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
feels a little better for extended uses

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
feels a little better for extended uses
because<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.710> wider<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because it's a little bit wider but it's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810 
because it's a little bit wider but it's
not<00:01:21.150> by<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:23.040> has<00:01:23.490> good

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
not by much at all and this has good

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
not by much at all and this has good
grip<00:01:24.030> too<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> valley<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.409> don't

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
grip too because of the valley I don't

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.740 
grip too because of the valley I don't
know<00:01:25.770> they're<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:26.939> two<00:01:27.270> totally<00:01:27.720> different

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
know they're not two totally different

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.800 
know they're not two totally different
knives<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.920> they're<00:01:29.509> there's<00:01:30.509> enough

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
knives but they're there's enough

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.749 
knives but they're there's enough
difference<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.610> why<00:01:32.729> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
difference in them to you know why I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.569 
difference in them to you know why I
carry<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.570> another<00:01:33.689> one

enjoy<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.550> think<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.910> almost<00:02:45.180> as<00:02:45.830> kind

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
enjoy that I think of it almost as kind

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.650 
enjoy that I think of it almost as kind
of<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:46.980> BG<00:02:47.900> 42<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.320> sense<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.910> acts<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
lot like my BG 42 Sebenza and that it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.160 
lot like my BG 42 Sebenza and that it
you<00:02:55.860> know<00:02:55.950> how<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.280> s30v<00:02:56.910> takes<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.930> razor

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you know how like s30v takes a razor

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.430 
you know how like s30v takes a razor
edge<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.760> after<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.150> use<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.930> little<00:03:01.230> bit

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
edge but after you use it a little bit

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920 
edge but after you use it a little bit
it<00:03:01.680> dulls<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.580> kind<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.000> becomes<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.450> working

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
it dulls up it kind of becomes a working

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.650 
it dulls up it kind of becomes a working
edge<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.740> still<00:03:05.010> sharp<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.300> may<00:03:06.450> not<00:03:06.480> be

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
edge it's still sharp but it may not be

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.900 
edge it's still sharp but it may not be
razor<00:03:07.170> sharp

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
razor sharp

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.250 
razor sharp
well<00:03:08.989> my<00:03:09.989> experience<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.940> BG<00:03:11.940> 42<00:03:12.600> likes<00:03:12.959> to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
well my experience is BG 42 likes to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
well my experience is BG 42 likes to
keep<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.650> razor<00:03:13.950> edge<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.580> little<00:03:14.970> bit<00:03:15.120> longer

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
keep that razor edge a little bit longer

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.900 
keep that razor edge a little bit longer
than<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.810> s30v<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.250> say<00:03:17.400> s30v

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
than like s30v and I just say s30v

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.979 
than like s30v and I just say s30v
because<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.660> kind<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
because you know it's kind of the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.320 
because you know it's kind of the
benchmark<00:03:19.170> super<00:03:20.040> steel<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.940> could<00:03:21.120> still

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
benchmark super steel if you could still

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.060 
benchmark super steel if you could still
call<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.690> super<00:03:21.989> steel<00:03:22.230> which<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.800> think<00:03:22.980> you

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
call it a super steel which I think you

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.550 
call it a super steel which I think you
can<00:03:23.780> but<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.590> BG<00:03:26.430> 42<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.840> seat<00:03:28.440> the
