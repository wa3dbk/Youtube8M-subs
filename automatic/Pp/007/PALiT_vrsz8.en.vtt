00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
 Nastya in this video I will show how to 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.960
 change speaker i.e. rewire it 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:14.040
 To do this, they themselves need new headphones 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.460
 speaker tweezers and soldering iron desirable 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 which tunic 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.020
 First you need to mount the speaker of the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.449
 I will re-solder the left side 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 respectively, taking Paul by four 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 fingers for the speaker itself that is between 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 mounting and speaker to fix here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.360
 this one was directed fingers i cling 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:46.410
 speaker now remove tinsel removed 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 quite easy speakers are 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.250
 small spikes desirable to cover 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 because then you need to remove the cap and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.620
 and you need to shoot very carefully because 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.480
 to you is likely to break himself 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:13.640
 fasteners i.e. need to be removed sharp 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:16.700
 subject on both sides now 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.330
 raise rooms and align it 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.479
 after this soldering iron is heated 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.479
 unsolder the wires 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:39.600
 ppv wire we put the wire to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:47.640
 contact and press a soldering iron waiting for 3 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:50.369
 seconds and wires soldered check everything 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.040
 holding on now everything needs to be put on 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.369
 a place 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 insert the wire in soot we are in such 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.890
 position close the cap to the wire 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.890
 hit this channel 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.050
 the speaker should be nodded carefully 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.560
 not to defeat the membranes that is, you need 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.390
 grab it from all sides with your fingers 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:41.440
 send to the seat and one 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 motion snap thanks for 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560
 Attention
