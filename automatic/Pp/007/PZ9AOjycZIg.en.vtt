00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.309 
hello hoopers today I'm going teaching
you<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.790> modified<00:00:03.240> vortex<00:00:03.750> from<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.140> knees

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
you the modified vortex from the knees

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.650 
you the modified vortex from the knees
for<00:00:05.250> purposes<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.940> tutorial<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.600> going

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
for purposes of this tutorial I'm going

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.210 
for purposes of this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:06.810> be<00:00:06.930> out<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.259> frame<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.980> chest

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
to be out of frame from about the chest

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.950 
to be out of frame from about the chest
up<00:00:08.400> for<00:00:08.610> most<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> but<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.599> will<00:00:09.690> help<00:00:09.809> you

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
up for most of it but that will help you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.129 
up for most of it but that will help you
see<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.530> actual<00:00:11.280> move<00:00:11.490> that's<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.139> also

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
see the actual move that's going on also

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.870 
see the actual move that's going on also
if<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.410> haven't<00:00:13.650> learned<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> vortex<00:00:14.639> yet

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
if you haven't learned the vortex yet

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.430 
if you haven't learned the vortex yet
from<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> waist<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.599> suggest<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> learn<00:00:16.260> it

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
from the waist I suggest you learn it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.160 
from the waist I suggest you learn it
first<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.039> i'll<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> lot<00:00:17.820> easier<00:00:18.170> so

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
first and i'll make this a lot easier so

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.220 
first and i'll make this a lot easier so
here<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.520> move<00:00:20.820> looks<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:24.230> from

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
here is what this move looks like from

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.950 
here is what this move looks like from
pooping<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> knees<00:00:26.599> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.750> reach

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
pooping at the knees you can reach

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
pooping at the knees you can reach
around<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.260> grab<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.740> pull<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.250> into

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
around and grab it and pull it up into

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.950 
around and grab it and pull it up into
the<00:00:30.000> vortex<00:00:35.059> now<00:00:36.059> how<00:00:36.420> you're<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> do

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the vortex now how you're going to do

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.869 
the vortex now how you're going to do
this<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.710> um<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> hooping<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> knees

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this is um you hooping at the knees

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
this is um you hooping at the knees
obviously<00:00:39.629> let<00:00:40.530> me<00:00:40.649> turn<00:00:40.800> around<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.250> get

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
obviously let me turn around here get

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.630 
obviously let me turn around here get
that<00:00:41.879> next<00:00:42.059> buckshot<00:00:42.719> happening<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.640> you're

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that next buckshot happening and you're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
that next buckshot happening and you're
going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> place<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.059> hand<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.559> backs<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
going to place your hand on the backs of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.970 
going to place your hand on the backs of
your<00:00:47.100> knees<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.989> let<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> hoop<00:00:49.289> roll<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
your knees and let the hoop roll the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.549 
your knees and let the hoop roll the
CrossFit<00:00:50.780> much<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> did<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.350> learning

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
CrossFit much like you did when learning

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.930 
CrossFit much like you did when learning
the<00:00:52.710> vortex<00:00:53.129> when<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> put<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.640> against<00:00:53.910> your

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the vortex when you put it against your

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
the vortex when you put it against your
back<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:55.140> would<00:00:55.260> feel<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.620> hoop<00:00:55.800> go

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
back and you would feel the hoop go

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.139 
back and you would feel the hoop go
across<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> much<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.960> say<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> after<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
across it is much to say so after you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
across it is much to say so after you
feel<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.690> rhythm<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.379> when<00:01:01.590> it's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
feel that rhythm and you know when it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.520 
feel that rhythm and you know when it's
coming<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:02.359> you're<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> grab<00:01:04.350> your

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
coming around you're going to grab your

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.850 
coming around you're going to grab your
hoop<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.060> you're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.500> pull<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> up

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
hoop and you're going to pull it up

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.969 
hoop and you're going to pull it up
using<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.760> elbow<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> got<00:01:09.830> you're<00:01:10.830> going

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
using your elbow as I got you're going

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.640 
using your elbow as I got you're going
to<00:01:11.040> grab<00:01:11.220> nville<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> mean<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to grab nville now what I mean when I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.539 
to grab nville now what I mean when I
say<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.369> elbow<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> guide<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:19.549> instead

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
say use your elbow as a guide is instead

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
say use your elbow as a guide is instead
of<00:01:20.700> grabbing<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.299> pulling<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> straight

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
of grabbing it and pulling it straight

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.580 
of grabbing it and pulling it straight
up<00:01:22.549> that's<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.020> anything<00:01:25.229> other

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
up that's not going to do anything other

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.950 
up that's not going to do anything other
than<00:01:26.330> number<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> get

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
than number one you're going to get

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.460 
than number one you're going to get
stuck<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.400> height<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.259> also<00:01:31.259> as

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
stuck about this height and also as

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
stuck about this height and also as
you're<00:01:31.680> pulling<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.189> since<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:32.909> not

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you're pulling it up since you're not

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.870 
you're pulling it up since you're not
moving<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.479> your<00:01:33.659> hoop<00:01:34.549> you're<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
moving with your hoop you're going to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.160 
moving with your hoop you're going to
run<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.329> space<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.350> comes<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> then

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
run out of space as it comes up and then

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
run out of space as it comes up and then
you're<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> run<00:01:40.500> out<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.680> hoop<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you're going to run out of hoop and you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.950 
you're going to run out of hoop and you
won't<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.210> able<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> above<00:01:42.750> yours

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
won't be able to get it above yours

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.109 
won't be able to get it above yours

always had in my head I am not sure if
it<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.340> help<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.000> confuse<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it will help you or just confuse you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
it will help you or just confuse you
more<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.899> I've<00:02:01.110> always<00:02:01.590> thought<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
more but I've always thought of it as a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.639 
more but I've always thought of it as a
ceiling<00:02:03.299> fan<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.229> above<00:02:04.469> my<00:02:04.619> head

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
ceiling fan is going on above my head

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.350 
ceiling fan is going on above my head
and<00:02:05.009> there's<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> string<00:02:05.729> attached<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.299> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and there's a string attached to one of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
and there's a string attached to one of
the<00:02:06.420> propellers<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.439> detached<00:02:07.829> my<00:02:08.069> elbow

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the propellers which detached my elbow

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.670 
the propellers which detached my elbow
and<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.830> ceiling<00:02:11.489> fan<00:02:11.520> goes<00:02:11.849> around

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and so as that ceiling fan goes around

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.309 
and so as that ceiling fan goes around
it<00:02:12.799> takes<00:02:13.219> my<00:02:13.700> elbow<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:15.109> that<00:02:15.260> makes

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
it takes my elbow with it if that makes

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.849 
it takes my elbow with it if that makes
sense<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:16.730> not<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:17.719> of<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.170> guiding

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
sense if not just think of just guiding

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.860 
sense if not just think of just guiding
with<00:02:18.950> your<00:02:19.069> elbow<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.459> circle<00:02:19.870> because

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
with your elbow in a circle because

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.899 
with your elbow in a circle because
essentially<00:02:21.319> i'm<00:02:22.010> going<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.189> bring<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.609> up<00:02:22.760> a

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
essentially i'm going to bring this up a

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.630 
essentially i'm going to bring this up a
little<00:02:23.000> bit<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.329> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.750> better

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
little bit so you can see it better

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.619 
little bit so you can see it better
essentially<00:02:26.739> adam<00:02:27.739> pooping<00:02:28.010> around<00:02:28.189> my<00:02:28.280> knees

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
essentially adam pooping around my knees

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.500 
essentially adam pooping around my knees
like<00:02:29.629> I<00:02:29.750> said<00:02:29.959> if<00:02:30.049> I<00:02:30.109> just<00:02:30.139> pull<00:02:30.500> straight<00:02:30.530> up

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
like I said if I just pull straight up

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.839 
like I said if I just pull straight up
then<00:02:32.510> I'm<00:02:32.629> going<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.840> run<00:02:32.959> out<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.109> room

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
then I'm going to run out of room

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.520 
then I'm going to run out of room
however<00:02:34.849> if<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.980> follow<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:38.000> elbow<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.959> do

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
however if I follow my elbow here and do

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.420 
however if I follow my elbow here and do
kind<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:39.950> circular<00:02:40.159> motion<00:02:40.599> then<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:41.719> can<00:02:42.430> go

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
kind of a circular motion then I can go

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
kind of a circular motion then I can go
away<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:44.079> difference<00:02:45.079> between<00:02:45.319> this<00:02:45.500> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
away up to difference between this and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.759 
away up to difference between this and
this<00:02:47.889> because<00:02:48.889> you<00:02:49.040> have<00:02:50.470> run<00:02:51.470> out<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.620> space

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
this because you have run out of space

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.940 
this because you have run out of space
and<00:02:52.599> this<00:02:53.599> your<00:02:53.840> kind<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.079> creating<00:02:54.709> more

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
and this your kind of creating more

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.959 
and this your kind of creating more
space<00:02:55.159> as<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.519> goes<00:02:55.730> around<00:02:56.439> so<00:02:57.439> as<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.969> do

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
space as it goes around so as you do

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.339 
space as it goes around so as you do
that<00:02:59.469> sure<00:03:00.469> to<00:03:00.650> grab<00:03:00.829> from<00:03:01.159> behind<00:03:02.169> feel<00:03:03.169> the

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
that sure to grab from behind feel the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.679 
that sure to grab from behind feel the
hoop<00:03:03.500> hit<00:03:03.680> your<00:03:03.829> hand<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.280> then<00:03:05.239> as<00:03:05.389> it<00:03:05.540> comes

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
hoop hit your hand and then as it comes

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.830 
hoop hit your hand and then as it comes
across<00:03:05.930> grab<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.829> pull<00:03:08.439> like<00:03:09.439> that<00:03:10.540> now<00:03:11.540> some

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
across grab and pull like that now some

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.920 
across grab and pull like that now some
tips<00:03:12.049> for<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.349> are<00:03:12.919> if<00:03:13.609> you<00:03:14.419> have<00:03:14.450> multiple

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
tips for this are if you have multiple

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.170 
tips for this are if you have multiple
sizes<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.680> hoops<00:03:15.919> use<00:03:16.370> your<00:03:16.549> biggest<00:03:17.000> hoop

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
sizes of hoops use your biggest hoop

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.089 
sizes of hoops use your biggest hoop
while<00:03:17.419> you're<00:03:17.540> doing<00:03:17.629> this<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:18.019> because<00:03:18.739> that

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
while you're doing this one because that

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.430 
while you're doing this one because that
will<00:03:19.190> give<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.579> more<00:03:20.239> space<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:21.019> work<00:03:21.379> with

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
will give you more space to work with

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.849 
will give you more space to work with
because<00:03:22.400> if<00:03:22.699> you're<00:03:22.819> going<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.090> be<00:03:23.180> doing<00:03:23.269> this

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
because if you're going to be doing this

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.640 
because if you're going to be doing this
you<00:03:24.859> want<00:03:25.159> as<00:03:25.449> much<00:03:26.449> space<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.019> work<00:03:27.319> with<00:03:27.379> as

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
you want as much space to work with as

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.559 
you want as much space to work with as
possible<00:03:28.069> because<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.849> way<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.030> won't<00:03:29.359> run

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
possible because that way you won't run

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.869 
possible because that way you won't run
out<00:03:29.629> of<00:03:29.780> space<00:03:29.989> as<00:03:30.349> fast<00:03:31.810> also<00:03:33.549> as<00:03:34.549> we're<00:03:34.790> doing

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
out of space as fast also as we're doing

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.089 
out of space as fast also as we're doing
this<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.689> can<00:03:35.900> control<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.560> pace<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:36.979> your

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
this you can control the pace of your

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.110 
this you can control the pace of your
hoop<00:03:37.280> by<00:03:38.090> simple<00:03:38.720> hand<00:03:39.019> manipulation<00:03:39.909> so<00:03:40.909> as

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
hoop by simple hand manipulation so as

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.509 
hoop by simple hand manipulation so as
you<00:03:41.150> grab<00:03:41.569> it<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:42.709> don't<00:03:42.889> have<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.370> going

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
you grab it you don't have to be going

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.149 
you grab it you don't have to be going
as<00:03:43.699> fast<00:03:43.879> as<00:03:44.090> your<00:03:44.239> hoop<00:03:44.389> is<00:03:44.599> we're<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.109> bit<00:03:45.290> so

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
as fast as your hoop is we're a bit so

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.129 
as fast as your hoop is we're a bit so
once<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.669> get<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:48.099> really<00:03:49.099> control

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
once you get it you can really control

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.499 
once you get it you can really control
the<00:03:51.139> pace<00:03:51.439> of<00:03:51.769> your<00:03:52.040> hoop<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.120> as<00:03:53.180> soon<00:03:53.299> as<00:03:53.419> you

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:53.509 
the pace of your hoop so as soon as you

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.439 
the pace of your hoop so as soon as you
grab<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.680> were<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:54.859> control<00:03:55.099> of<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:56.239> it

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
grab you were in control of that so it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.749 
grab you were in control of that so it
doesn't<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.049> be<00:03:57.079> going<00:03:57.319> super<00:03:58.310> hurricane

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
doesn't have to be going super hurricane

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.050 
doesn't have to be going super hurricane
fast<00:03:59.030> as<00:03:59.359> it<00:03:59.930> comes<00:04:00.139> up<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.979> can<00:04:01.340> if<00:04:01.639> that's<00:04:01.939> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
fast as it comes up it can if that's the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.509 
fast as it comes up it can if that's the
way<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.269> want<00:04:02.599> it<00:04:02.689> to<00:04:02.919> but<00:04:03.919> really<00:04:04.220> if<00:04:04.400> you're

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
way you want it to but really if you're

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.179 
way you want it to but really if you're
learning<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.419> have<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.680> know<00:04:06.799> if

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
learning and you have to you know if
