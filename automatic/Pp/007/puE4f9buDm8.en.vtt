I enjoyed it on B note however I wasn't

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.550 
I enjoyed it on B note however I wasn't
a<00:02:20.040> big<00:02:20.220> fan<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:20.880> using<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.570> s5<00:02:22.290> for

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
a big fan of it when using the s5 for

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.290 
a big fan of it when using the s5 for
example<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.400> almost<00:02:23.580> seemed<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.820> have<00:02:24.000> gotten

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
example it almost seemed to have gotten

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
example it almost seemed to have gotten
in<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> way<00:02:24.600> too<00:02:24.660> much<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.680> seems<00:02:25.890> like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
in the way too much but it seems like

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.530 
in the way too much but it seems like
they<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.160> been<00:02:26.460> toning<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.850> down<00:02:26.880> over<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
they have been toning it down over the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.630 
they have been toning it down over the
years<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.200> seems<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> be<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> case<00:02:29.220> once

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
years and that seems to be the case once

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.480 
years and that seems to be the case once
again<00:02:29.760> here<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.660> s6<00:02:31.280> everything<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.370> very

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
again here on the s6 everything is very

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.030

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
but I'm gonna have to put it through its

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.480 
but I'm gonna have to put it through its

I preferred the white model however is

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.199 
I preferred the white model however is
the<00:03:40.830> fact<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.400> blue<00:03:41.670> model<00:03:41.880> will

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
the fact that the blue model will

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.690 
the fact that the blue model will
attract<00:03:42.660> finger<00:03:42.989> prints<00:03:43.350> very<00:03:43.769> easily<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
attract finger prints very easily and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.550 
attract finger prints very easily and
that<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.239> white<00:03:45.420> model<00:03:45.780> tends<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.140> do<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> very

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
that the white model tends to do a very

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.140 
that the white model tends to do a very
good<00:03:46.650> job<00:03:46.800> at<00:03:47.160> hiding<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.670> along<00:03:48.120> with

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
good job at hiding that along with

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.449 
good job at hiding that along with
