 35 minutes to make cake pops 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.090
 we are going to need the sponge cake that

 we just worked out already cold or also 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.420

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.349
 400 grams of chocolate coating 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.349

 butter cream that you can also 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.050
 consult in the description 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.870
 and vegetable dyes in gel 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.120
 sticks for cake pops 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.610
 if your chocolate coverage is a 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.879
 little thick will use butter 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.300
 cocoa or butter and if you wish 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.480
 preserves for garnish 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.560
 to make 14 cake pops we are going to use 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.080
 Half of this cake 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 they divide again and rub one half 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.430
 against another to make crumbs if the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.140
 base burned a bit removes the for not 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.140
 affect the color of the pallets 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.060
 make sure it is finely 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.060
 powdered 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.360
 Gradually add cream 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.750
 butter until you get a mixture 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.900
 manageable but not very humid 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.900
 to 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.340
 the mixture should serve to make 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.710
 balls of approximately 3 centimeters 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.710
 in diameter that maintain their shape 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.889
 to 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.690
 in this case we are going to make skulls but 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.860
 You can make a variety of 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.460
 grounds 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.789
 Y 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.800
 once they have the shape you want 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.800
 Refrigerate approximately 30 minutes 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.260
 while they cool we are going to melt the 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.600
 chocolate this time I'm going to 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.510
 heat in segments of 15 in 15 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:12.400
 seconds in the microwave but you can 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.800
 doing it in a bain-marie uses a 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.050
 narrow and tall container so that the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.080
 liquid gets deeper and have 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.750
 careful not to burn it to make it a 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.800
 little more liquid adds little by little 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.800
 cocoa butter 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.039
 take the balls out of the refrigerator and 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.069
 dipping the stick a little in the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.500
 chocolate insert it carefully into the 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.030
 balls without passing the center of the 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.090
 same 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.060
 return to the refrigerator until it 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.249
 fix the stick in our case were 30 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.619
 minutes 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:50.689
 while they are still cooling you can 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.659
 make chocolate a little more fluid 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:55.279
 to cover them completely 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.750
 making sure to integrate the butter well 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:00.850
 or butter that you use 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.980
 Carefully immerse your pallets 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.980
 taking care that they are covered 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.970
 completely and put them upright 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.970
 so that they harden 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.319
 to decorate the colors to your class and 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:23.719
 using a bag or pastry bag 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.719
 small decorate them to your liking 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.249
 yes 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.520
 If you want you can omit the sticks for 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.860
 make mini cakes the gay pops are 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.050
 ideal for any occasion because 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.070
