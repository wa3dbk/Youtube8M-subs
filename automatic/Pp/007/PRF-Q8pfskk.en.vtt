00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.549
 Hello dear friends and warmly 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.190
 welcome to tobi lothar i around here 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.250
 you get numerous tips and tricks 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.830
 to tinker and to be here and there 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 we also have a few experiments 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.619
 sometimes they become whole 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.080
 big sometimes a bit smaller 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.090
 but usually they burst in the best 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.780
 In case you bring children's eyes to you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 to shine 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 The speech is about soap bubbles and how 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.489
 you can just blow soap bubbles at home 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 can do it yourself 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.140
 I'll show you in this video you 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.039
 need some wire 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.379
 I have 20 cm of it from it 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 five tablespoons and as we small glycerin 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.090
 to handle we replace this fabric 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.160
 just with icing sugar of it five 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 tablespoon then we need one more 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.670
 wooden spoon an empty water bottle a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.400
 jug a liter of water and bottling 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.400
 the mixture starts a funnel 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.920
 First of all we give the sugar 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.830
 together with the detergent in the jar 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:28.159
 in there we give it very carefully 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.500
 Add the water we need the mixture 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.960
 now with the help of the wooden spoon it completely 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.860
 Stir gently so that I can do everything 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.560
 can mix well with each other with help 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.929
 a funnel we give the finished 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.530
 Soap bubbles mix now in the void 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:51.170
 blow bottle in the soap bubbles 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.750
 we are with the wheel and help 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 of a round object we turn 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.340
 use a line stick container and 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.840
 so that there are no injuries 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.080
 we have a little bit more 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.189
 This is how our soap bubbles sound 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.619
 then out na you saw and so 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.590
 You can just blow soap bubbles at home 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.690
