 hello to all here so today I have 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.140
 decided to make my first video I 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.720
 would like to launch my youtube channel 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.860
 so this is a novelty for me I 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.650
 never did that before 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.330
 I love to tinker with many things I have 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.620
 a lot of ideas a lot of imagination 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.600
 and I said to myself it serves me yes but I 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.730
 never do anything with finally very 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.620
 concrete after I do a lot of things 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.180
 for the world in three games for my 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.550
 loved ones for my family for all the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 world and I thought to myself but why 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.329
 not share all my ideas with 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.210
 other people and why not to 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.800
 find people who are interested in 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.519
 same things as me my principle is fine 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.670
 to be giving you a lot of ideas from 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:58.300
 things to do with a little kid 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.670
 budget almost without spending 0 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.039
 euros so that's because it's 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.620
 again for me I'm going to try two 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.690
 three things to start then me my 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.310
 idea was to present an idea 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.720
 video b suddenly it would be of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.280
 little videos but you could 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.780
 watch very often more often 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.180
 that a video where every two weeks 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.340
 all this is so I will try to me 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.280
 hold on and we'll see what's going on 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.990
 So today is the first gift 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.649
 we're going to realize it's going to be a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 calendar 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.110
 you see the calendar we buy 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.850
 all very expensive for christmas finally rihanna 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.860
 cheaper too but it's good 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.719
 an investment instead of throwing it away 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.920
 because after Christmas it is used could 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.280
 finally like now I do not heat and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.020
 it's over we'll get it back and we'll 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.229
 use it to make a new 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.180
 calendar that we will use for good 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.039
 other things than chocolate master 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.159
 in and you 'll see that with a 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.070
 empty advent calendar we can do 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.310
 a lot of very nice things for 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.789
 in the end get a nice gift that makes 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.789
 very pleasure
