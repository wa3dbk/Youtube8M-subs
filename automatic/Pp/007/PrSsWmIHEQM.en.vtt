 one step back you need to do 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.790
 Again, this process is wipe in the direction but 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.500
 to make back forward simple 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.950

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.119
 Safari many of you probably lived with 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.940

 see we pinch the button. and besides 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.040
 dot com appearance we get more 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.580
 several domains that we can 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.000
 use 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.119
 plus appeared handy what's like a search by 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.039

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.509
 There is a thing in the google chrome application 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.539

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.130

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.239
 from children to enveloped 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.560
 us here in universal access besides 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.380
 the fact that you can increase to decrease 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.780
 font size there is such a function under 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.849
 the name of the switch control is essentially that 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.370
 You can manage your device and 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.980
 smartphone in general using motion 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.620
 head left or right our why 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.989
 chose movement said that leads to 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.989
 Activation of the series, that is, the smartphone is watching 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.640
 behind your head through the camera and then 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.769
 activates those functions that you 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.019
 pick up 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.850
 one of the very important new ios chips 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.190
 became the ability to create black 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.410
 a list ie blocking unwanted 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.620
 contact blocking from all calls 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.780
 posts of st youth from on video to 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.139
 Generally completely blocking all connections 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.109
 contacts and then it all happens 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.290
 in us in the phone you can do either 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.079
 can go into the settings further into the phone 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.180
 and there will be a list displayed by your 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.389
 blocked contact where you swipe 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.970
 you can unblock it immediately 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:07.000
 from here we move our messages and 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.030
 so small but cool and useful 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.680
 thing like viewing the send time and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.790
 receiving messages for this need 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.910
 just snap 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.820
 again pull right to left with your finger 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.680
 on the screen and you will have time on the right 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.560
 sending messages to just let go 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.450
 finger she will immediately disappear we all 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160
 probably love the appstore and don't know how u 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.169
 you windows often had a situation when 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.270
 The city of Helmut found Wi Fi and his 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.600
 speed or just not enough time 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.920

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.290
 so general new feature in the appstore 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.540
 allows you to add a sentence in so 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.000

 this application if it is there 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.730
 worthwhile to talk again a little bit about PMC 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.610

 directly from photographs that is 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.300
