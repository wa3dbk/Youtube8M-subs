00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.770
 of the video for more information and now 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.509
 everyone here yale WHO and the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.240
 youtube channel of yale usa mexico and 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.400
 this day I bring you a nice tutorial 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.380
 de force island we see that there are many 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.120
 glitches here on force island and that's 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 particularly liked was not located the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.949
 face and put them on purpose but here 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 we have more options of force still 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.699
 in case you do not know very well where 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.039
 they want to make their map or if they want to do 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.109
 an infection map or something interesting 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.179
 Well now I bring you a glitch that you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.320
 basically allows to make fors below 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.050
 of the water 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.630
 basically they go to this part between the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 Big island and the medium island do not enter 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 the medium island and the small island between 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 the big and the medium just in 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.260
 this part where it is darker than the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.899
 other parts we will go there with a point 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 of reappearance let's put what the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.170
 physical are normal because I committed the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.059
 error at the beginning of trying the glitch 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 precisely to put it in physics in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.220
 fixed phase do not put it like that put what 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.380
 normal normal physics and then 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 they just push it away as much as they can 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.750
 of you and are approaching the water what 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.620
 more than they can even die when they die 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.170
 will appear immediately in the 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.970
 water but they will be in an area where 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 will kill you in 10 seconds if you do not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.720
 they remove from there so they climb as much 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.520
 fast they can until they no longer 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 disappear the message and that's where 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.250
 you can start doing the force 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.140
 The place where the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 they can do they can go out they can 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.130
 expand all over force island 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.610
 literally clear if they will reach them 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 objects but basically if they can be 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.070
 all force island under the water and that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.009
 it's pretty good because apart from 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.450
 that the spartans are not affected by 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 the fact that they are below the water 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.770
 here you simply move normal 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.440
 et cetera so you can add some 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.590
 blocks make a floor and add some 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.340
 effects put certain things here and do 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.970
 a perfect map of force with an effect 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.010
 of haze pretty well done then 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.940
 they can be here below the water too 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.400
 they can put 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.790
 effect to give them the tone of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.520
 looking for nemo can basically do 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.870
 many things here under the water can 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.580
 do exactly the normal thing just 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.110
 remember so they keep going up I try 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.380
 of leaving the sea they will die 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.410
 instantly because in that area 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.180
 between the beginning of the sea and a little more 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.700
 in the middle where are they going to do 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.800
 The force is basically an area that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.170
 crossing it kills you instantly 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.560
 so be careful with that, do not go up so much 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.570
 do not go down so much, it's not infinite either 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310
 I swear I tried it and something else 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.870
 try to put reappearance points 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.090
 because if they get lost and they are not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.790
 they will be in a serious problem is 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.890
 quite difficult to meet sometimes if 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.530
 they get lost here so I hope that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.540
 clichÃ© you liked the sign is 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.010
 for more videos like this one share the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.560
 video with your friends if you liked it and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.750
 they want to continue making maps in force 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.580
 island and apart from well if any of your 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.310
 friends is interested in force and has not 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.140
 seen this glitch send the video to them 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.380
 I remember that is our facebook and 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.210
 our twitter here below 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.820
 all follow us on facebook which is where 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.350
 more we also publish is my facebook 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.480
 staff that is where I also put 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.770
 anything that comes to mind but 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.820
 well that was all for today I hope 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.680
 that you liked the video and 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.780
 remember I'm jean lous and for the channel 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.260
 of youtube from heller and mexico 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.260
 until next time
