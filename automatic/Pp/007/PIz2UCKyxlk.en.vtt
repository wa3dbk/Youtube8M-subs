00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.630
 and we 'll have it here with another video 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.520
 months of work per month are well 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.410
 coming to another video this time one 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.440
 video that 100 issues on the second channel 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.960
 but I'll try to bring it to you 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.029
 one thing that asks me too much about 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.000
 the loc from camera to camera when you 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.570
 The game begins, she comes and 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.740
 You play when you do not play with her. 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.930
 well, but as I do I'll explain 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.970
 When you 're with the camera, so you? 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.650
 can not get a sense of one 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.510
 example here I can not see where your 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.160
 Mom, I do not have control of where 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.620
 he is I do not have control of 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.800
 position so I can not be creating 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.390
 a cool move to catch him or 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.340
 played also in the lack can not in the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.430
 next time it gives me agony in my 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.930
 opinion I say unlock camera pa 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.150
 now I see where he is a little 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.140
 ago but he's here already can see and O 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.790
 calm 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.840
 playing against boats to demonstrate 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 This is better for me, it has to stay here. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 watching the game and so will 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.770
 look at the bis in my god 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.820
 for example I have largely decided to help 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.210
 in the boat for example you will not see him 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.490
 with your camera locked here 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.350
 recorder you will not see it now if 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.700
 only I have not fought 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.259
 You'll see him coming here. 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.479
 by the river through the bush 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.310
 verÃ³n to enter any position of it and 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.659
 How will you keep up with that gain? 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.039
 on here 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.119
 another tip I give to anyone who plays 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.960
 cameras use the space bar 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.060
 attack on the camera to en the space bar 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.670
 here in the camera low space leaves your 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.700
 big thumb on the space bar and the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.219
 your other two on what wr ok then 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.670
 I'm here looking at shin to my 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.200
 team is suffering year for if I want 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.299
 that the camera is stuck in it without me 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.579
 to have to stop forever left the 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:09.069
 tight O response is very calm 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.810
 It's much better than you play with 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.959
 camera you have a little more than 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 notion is lost space bar is 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.580
 quiet 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.560
 Okay and so will you have a better notion 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.450
 face was running attack with the camera 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.360
 not seeing where he is. 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.610
 you can not go straight 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 if you have less movement speed way 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.130
 You can not give an offensive flash. 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.080
 to create a legal move answered more 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.300
 This video is more or less that way, that's it. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.550
 give a touch to this galley that asks me 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.890
 vixi very very much in the comments 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.600
 who can not play with the camera 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.540
 unlocked here is another help for 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.790
 you do not have much to talk to 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.370
 it is usual practice with the camera 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.020
 not working you can not play 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.700
 with the camera locked 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.890
 have you ever seen any competitive players 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.480
 play with the camera locked then not 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.610
 goodbye will not roll 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.620
 You will not get there and platinum gold. 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.250
 playing with the camera will not be 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.590
 Be very proud. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 but my recommendation is this worse yet 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.560
 when it attacks the locked camera is when 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.750
 Are you hangu? 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.570
 you have no notion of others or 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.459
 This can play with the camera locked yes 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.660
 in the spacebar 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.700
 'm here souto my charm here ready 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.200
 locked unlocked because I let go I go 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.010
 up there I see how the position of the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.670
 shin dong offensive a coffee and so on 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.500
 go 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.769
 If I had the camera locked, Jaime 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.980
 detriment of this part here then I am 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.870
 here the cheta flee in the south attack and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.830
 is also fleeing the camera locked as 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.570
 and it gets bad 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.480
 now here I already have a better notion 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.830
 where he is from 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.739
 understood that's what I want to spend on this 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.900
 short video without editing because it has no 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.810
 much to talk about it here today only 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.840
 How I got the camera locked after a 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.610
 offensive move that would mean died 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.410
 if I had the camera locked I would not go 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.120
 able to make a business of this 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.250
 or even go with much more 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.650
 difficulties in seeing his position as 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.180
 if they play with cameras they work 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.290
 it's a tip for you 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.690
 I think it's one of the best tips 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.540
 possible to prove it to you I do not 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.520
 I have to talk about the camera, that's it. 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.900
