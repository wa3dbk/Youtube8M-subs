00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.900
 very good all kids how are you 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.700
 I hope very well of course 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.650
 as you are seeing in the title of the 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.929
 today's video I will talk about the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.119
 aggressiveness but not from a point of 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.579
 negative view but rather positive 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.470
 as something that we can take advantage of and that 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.960
 must be done in the call of duty to 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.369
 get certain goals so 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.949
 well the gameplay is short is a 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.810
 second round of domain the first the 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.060
 removed the first one I'm not going to 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.339
 teach because I take out a clip makes a 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.110
 low flip chain before you'll see in 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.270
 the next episode of this is not a 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.620
 montage here by the way I'm lying on 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.780
 the floor and I passed it to fast camera 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.370
 because I was talking about whatsapp with 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.590
 one of the colleagues I was with 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.390
 playing because I had no micro in this 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.370
 moment because I was broken to see that 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.980
 we care about you what matters to us 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.870
 to all of us is the aggressiveness of 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.660
 what aggression serves us in the call 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.550
 of duty and why because I've taken out another 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.739
 once again the theme of assemblies 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.710
 because many of you always that is 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.410
 some assembly you ask me tell me 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.910
 to the vice in quotation marks saying how 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.369
 you can get those clip to partners 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.820
 unable to get less as you do 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.770
 framework 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.590
 tell me what class you have where you 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.640
 you move why do you do this or that and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.700
 today I'm going to talk about something pretty 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.030
 quite important to understand how 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.369
 I like rubÃ©n and like others perhaps 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.350
 youtuber that you see Americans can be 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.780
 take out the clips that are taken out to make 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.040
 the montages that do as well as taste 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.350
 attentive kids because they see that I was going to 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.720
 be very short and I will try 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.110
 explain myself as best as possible so over there 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.660
 we go 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.570
 first kids you have to think 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.310
 when you play and go to play for 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.470
 clips because you want to take out the you 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.539
 a montage or you want to take osuna out 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.670
 works in a chain of casualties that 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.770
 many of you ask me ships 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.869
 please tell me some advice as well 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.080
 will make a career of casualties as all this 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.170
 all either clips either medals either 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.690
 simply play with a certain style 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.700
 has to do with aggression if not 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.960
 you are aggressive or aggressive, I mean 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.399
 to do what I'm doing or be 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.039
 I'm alone in the restaurant and I'm going to 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.570
 enter the answer what does not happen 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.179
 as you are seeing I just got a 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.250
 super cow if I'm not wrong or a turbo 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.970
 low I do not know but the thing is to be 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.640
 aggressive 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.770
 enter the restore there will be 50,000 times that 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.720
 they kill you there will be a few times that you do not 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.120
 you kill you get it right and sometimes that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.700
 you fail but the key is the key 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.100
 fundamental apart from good to have good 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.930
 aim for luck and all that and 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.540
 have good connection and pim pim pam pam 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.370
 the fundamental key to be able to be 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.620
 Clicks to get medals 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 ultra low chain downs all that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 is the aggressive one or simply go without 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.650
 fear play without fear play without 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.020
 silencer if it is possible to go 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.820
 completely to sack or where is the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.130
 problem in this game it seems that I 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.810
 kill 13 times worth and where is the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.400
 problem they kill me 13 times and so 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.650
 quiet but has not brought me 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.610
 chain of casualties that is brutal a super 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.500
 low I also think that it is precious because 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.520
 this is for throwing me flowers look but 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.800
 I do not know is how things get 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.220
 kids with the received being 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.870
 aggressive being I do not know if it is that the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.610
 word is aggression is that I do not know 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.440
 nothing better happens than saying or I do not have 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.270
 the ease of speech that others have 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.890
 youtubers but what we like in this 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.620
 channel is upload mounts and we can 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.730
 do because we are aggressive playing like this 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.780
 as kids but we liked the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.440
 video then we 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.440
 in the next
