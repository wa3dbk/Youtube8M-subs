00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hey my characters friends and sincerely 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.670
 welcome i am the christian and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.170
 perfectly draw punkt.de and that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 Courses are listed below 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.780
 description again exactly in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.429
 I want you this video once 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 show how to work in a simple way and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.900
 Wise hands can draw 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 and yes, that's not really the case 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 complicated you have to do a few things 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.859
 then keep one works quite well 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.680
 In addition to this video, there are still 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.890
 once a game of chance and find that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.289
 you in the channel the comic world i imagine you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 below in the description and he at the end 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.300
 the video once again a steering wheel like that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 that you switch to the channel once 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 can and you look at the desired 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.910
 You can check the terms of participation 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.860
 You're searching in this video and there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 Of course, then I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.180
 It 's great to win and now 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:58.260
 once I go today and Ransberg 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 so we start with the palm like 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.729
 it just gives it and yes that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.860
 is in itself such a kind of direct right that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.689
 Above something ready is this one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 side is the joint of the thumb 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.930
 just as every finger has one at the top 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.960
 ball for the joint that with the finger 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 the on then joins yes if we small 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.240
 dashes for the parts between the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 joints were, again a joint-one 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.320
 small joint and then tip of the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.960
 thumbs here then the middle piece to the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.070
 also finger your hand once before 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.409
 and pay attention to it as the differences 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.829
 are for example the little finger there 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.049
 are the limbs and commitments shorter 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.450
 as the middle finger of the middle finger 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.860
 is the longest finger ringfinger 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.099
 a tick bigger than the index finger 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:17.340
 and thumb is of course a bit wider 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:22.110
 slightly curved the other joints and 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.160
 the tips of the fingers are the ones above 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.120
 Ends the fingers over the whole 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.190
 annoying, so to speak 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.739
 that would be such a hand 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.569
 sketched that is actually that 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.870
 basic framework of a hand and exactly with 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.010
 You can use any of these techniques 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.910
 hand sign always a device away for the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.690
 palm take slightly larger joint 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.900
 the thumb and then the little balls 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.700
 and draw my fingers I draw 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.730
 The front here once very fast with it 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.640
 one can imagine how it is on the other hand 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.830
 It could be the end now 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.010
 Of course, you have all the fastest animals 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.440
 time of the world, therefore, so completely in peace 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.510
 try a few times you can do that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.230
 Of course, then also in the interior 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.170
 erase and the whole with one 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.209
 markers, so to speak, is round at the end 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.860
 now for example a hand in the 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.220
 should be manga style 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.760
 When drawing realistically you have to 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.890
 add a little more, but it's the same 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.390
 the other other videos so he then 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.590
 once again a hand from inside the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.510
 palm again here this 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.780
 Rectangle the slightly wider after 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.370
 on the top a little thicker joint for the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.189
 thumb the little balls again 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.900
 yes, that's not a bad thing 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.730
 complicated and I know you can you 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.769
 that will certainly be complete 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.400
 fantastic and yes 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.360
 Just give it a try 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.640
 if it did not work in the beginning 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.230
 then just start 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.569
 you do not make mistakes you collect 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.019
 the experience the most important thing is that you 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.459
 That's why you're the same 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.459
 get started 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.220
 google on the internet just take pictures 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.690
 the hands look like those positions 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.960
 they are shot like the whole one yes im 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.690
 everyday life looks like light and shadow 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 depending on what you do it for 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.140
 want to use 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.280
 if you like the whole thing for example 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.280
 said manga-style approach is 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.930
 always a bit coarser and simpler 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.120
 kept as realistic drawing 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.410
 so now it's your turn so go ahead and 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.250
 have fun 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.250
 the selection
