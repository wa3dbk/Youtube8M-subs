 the course of the press conference was 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.930

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.210

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.350
 skills 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.179

 peta the union of the two forces produced 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.149
 this method of bringing leisure time 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 which allows everyone with symbols 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.440
 very simple green yellow red of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.409
 to understand if in that in that locality it is 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 possible to play sports 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.440
 heard on TV are forecast 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.500
 generalist that means they talk to everyone but 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.200
 having to talk to everyone is simple 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.769
 they can't go into details and say 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.310
 I want to go I want to go trekking 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:38.239
 well they don't say on TV or on the site look 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.859
 those who want to trek these places 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.079

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:45.650

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.220
 activities take place 15 let's say 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.140
 the input to make the forecast 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.440
 useless notes that I make one 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.319

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.580
 camp weather giuliacci instead makes the 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.700

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.290
 and we conclude this evening too 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.079
 edition of the camper magoni slide with a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.959
 curiosity we speak of leica indeed of the 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.970
 spectacular 9900 rex line that was 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.170
 purchased by a couple of designers who 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.049
 have chosen to use this 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.480
 extraordinary camper like atelier houses 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.700
 with the intention of bringing the Italian style 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.760
 in the world what aboard your own 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.349
 a glamorous and camper couple for a 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.690
 glamorous camper how the idea of ​​was born 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:54.170
 decide to travel and carry around 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.989
 fashion for Italy and for the world is 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.730
 born from dusseldorf and we were for 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.200
 dussendorf fashion work e 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.330
 at the same time as the caravan fair 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.160
 salon 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.140
 we realized that in that city 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.920
 turned around motorhomes of 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.620
 any type 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.530
 out of curiosity in our free time 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.690
 we went to visit the fair e 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.510
 believe me it was love at first sight 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.540
 we fell in love with these means and 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.480
 we found out they could do al 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.300
 our case to our needs 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.940
 economic and professional life 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.860
 later after some time we have 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:39.400
 matured the idea of ​​bringing this this 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.560
 world much closer to ours 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.620
 needs in this case aesthetic and 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.110
 then to transform the motorhome 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.760
 this world in a real show 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.860
 room then to bring our aesthetics 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.430
 then our products inside and 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.530
 with total visibility as far as 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.750
 regards our buyers our 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.820
 journalists our world 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.910
 I would also like to ask Ms. Ho 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.530
 since for a certain period 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.169
 you will travel especially live in campers 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.440
 orders organizes in a more space 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.030
 small and shared compared to a home 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.040
 Well in short, we by the way we are 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.440
 we already live in a house but room 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.930
 small so we are used to 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.300
 being in spaces we can take the 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.020
 our spaces I must say that this lay 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.470
 rex line is fantastic because it is great at 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.400
 enough to be able to live 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.010
 long periods 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.100
 and then there is to say that it really can 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.070
 become atelier home because front 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.470
 we have also chosen the model with 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.990
 la di netta we say aeronautical style 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.440
 with 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.050
 the table that collapses and becomes 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.670
 really a huge living and we have 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.760
 already made several business meetings 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.150
 with people of the environment you are 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.190

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.860
