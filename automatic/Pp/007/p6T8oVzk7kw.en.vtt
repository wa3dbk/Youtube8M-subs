00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the orange parts next to the headlights

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.800 
the orange parts next to the headlights
are<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.130> perfect

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
are not perfect

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.760

it's<00:01:17.250> kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.610> iridescent<00:01:18.000> orange<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's kind of an iridescent orange so it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
it's kind of an iridescent orange so it

just<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> face<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> paint<00:01:40.530> could<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
just the face has the paint could have a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.490 
just the face has the paint could have a
little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.030> paint<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.259> overall

little bit more paint on the overall

head<00:01:43.799> sculpt<00:01:44.130> though<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:45.409> it's<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.530> bad

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
head sculpt though I think it's not bad

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.200 
head sculpt though I think it's not bad
always<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> molded<00:01:47.700> yellow<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
always got the molded yellow and the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
always got the molded yellow and the
molded<00:01:48.540> blacks<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> molded<00:01:49.500> gun<00:01:49.740> medals

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
molded blacks and the molded gun medals

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
molded blacks and the molded gun medals
and<00:01:50.310> grays<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.180> there's<00:01:51.390> enough<00:01:51.600> contrast<00:01:52.079> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and grays so there's enough contrast to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
and grays so there's enough contrast to
make<00:01:52.380> him<00:01:52.500> look<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.890> he<00:01:53.490> does<00:01:53.820> generally

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
make him look good he does generally

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.880 
make him look good he does generally
have<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:54.990> look<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.409> does<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
have the right look he does have the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.160 
have the right look he does have the
stripes<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.430> him<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.969> overall<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.960> pretty

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
stripes on him so overall it's a pretty

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.749 
stripes on him so overall it's a pretty
nice<00:01:58.409> looking<00:01:58.619> figure<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.369> terms<00:01:59.640> of

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
nice looking figure in terms of

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.670 
nice looking figure in terms of
accessories<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.719> he<00:02:00.930> has<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.439> right

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
accessories all he has is this right

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.840 
accessories all he has is this right
here<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> would<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.280> been<00:02:02.430> nice<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.820> got

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
here it would have been nice if we got

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
here it would have been nice if we got
two<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.390> they're<00:02:03.659> awfully<00:02:04.020> small<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
two of those they're awfully small and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.319 
two of those they're awfully small and
he<00:02:05.009> has<00:02:05.219> two<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> show<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.210> not

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
he has two in the show if I'm not

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
he has two in the show if I'm not
mistaken<00:02:06.750> he<00:02:07.079> does<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> pork<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.310> both

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
mistaken he does have the pork on both

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
mistaken he does have the pork on both
sides<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.750> would<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.899> been<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.229> nice

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
sides so it would have been really nice

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.199 
sides so it would have been really nice
if<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.649> had<00:02:10.679> two<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.160> instead<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.030> just

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
if we had two of them instead of just

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.150 
if we had two of them instead of just
the<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.440> that's<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.830> except

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the one that's it for except

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.240 
the one that's it for except
series<00:02:14.760> let's<00:02:15.450> talk<00:02:15.720> articulation<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.070> heads

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
series let's talk articulation the heads

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.850 
series let's talk articulation the heads
on<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> ball-joint<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.420> normal<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.320> rotates

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
on a ball-joint as is normal it rotates

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.860 
on a ball-joint as is normal it rotates
no<00:02:20.040> problem<00:02:20.550> looks<00:02:20.850> up<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:21.450> bit<00:02:21.600> not<00:02:21.840> too

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
no problem looks up a little bit not too

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.310 
no problem looks up a little bit not too
much<00:02:22.130> looks<00:02:23.130> down<00:02:23.370> decent<00:02:24.120> amount<00:02:24.360> good

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
much looks down decent amount good

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.660 
much looks down decent amount good
enough<00:02:25.560> I'd<00:02:25.740> say<00:02:25.950> pretty<00:02:26.160> good<00:02:26.400> range<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
enough I'd say pretty good range of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.310 
enough I'd say pretty good range of
motion<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> head<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.960> light-piping

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
motion for the head the light-piping

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.320 
motion for the head the light-piping
does<00:02:28.650> work<00:02:28.860> really<00:02:29.070> well<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.880> might<00:02:30.120> be<00:02:30.240> able

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
does work really well you might be able

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.450 
does work really well you might be able
to<00:02:30.420> tell<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> little<00:02:30.900> bit<00:02:31.020> right<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:32.250> since

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
to tell a little bit right now but since

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.160 
to tell a little bit right now but since
everything's<00:02:32.820> pretty<00:02:33.090> heavily<00:02:33.330> lit<00:02:33.720> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
everything's pretty heavily lit you

everything's pretty heavily lit you
might<00:02:34.410> not<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.720> shoulder<00:02:37.080> articulation<00:02:37.650> is

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
might not the shoulder articulation is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.590 
might not the shoulder articulation is
kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.130> weird<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.270> my<00:02:39.330> biggest

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
kind of weird now one of my biggest

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.970 
kind of weird now one of my biggest
complaint<00:02:40.050> about<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.350> guy<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
complaint about this guy is this

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.950 
complaint about this guy is this
mechanism<00:02:41.700> right<00:02:42.060> here<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.480> has<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.780> arm

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
mechanism right here that has the arm

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.330 
mechanism right here that has the arm
that<00:02:43.140> swings<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.680> from<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> wheel

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that swings up from where the wheel

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
that swings up from where the wheel
normally<00:02:44.730> goes<00:02:44.940> doesn't<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:45.960> any<00:02:46.110> unlocking

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
normally goes doesn't have any unlocking

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.230 
normally goes doesn't have any unlocking
feature<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.370> kind<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:47.880> kind<00:02:48.150> of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
feature so it's kind of just kind of

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.360 
feature so it's kind of just kind of
wonky<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.870> whole<00:02:49.050> time<00:02:49.350> while<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.160> posing

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
wonky the whole time while you're posing

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.280 
wonky the whole time while you're posing
it<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.790> are<00:02:50.910> supposed<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:52.050> like

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it in they are supposed to be up like

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.250 
it in they are supposed to be up like
this<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.820> want<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> wheel<00:02:54.330> part<00:02:54.690> right<00:02:54.990> here

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
this you want the wheel part right here

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.150 
this you want the wheel part right here
to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.680> up<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.220> forward<00:02:57.210> not<00:02:57.540> tucked<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.160> not

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
to be up and forward not tucked in not

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.490 
to be up and forward not tucked in not
any<00:02:59.490> other<00:02:59.730> way<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.210> down<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:01.080> supposed<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.380> be

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
any other way not down it supposed to be

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.800 
any other way not down it supposed to be
up<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.490> kind<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:03.000> tricky<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
up so it is kind of tricky to get the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.940 
up so it is kind of tricky to get the
arm<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.140> way<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.290> want<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.710> it's<00:03:04.800> going<00:03:04.830> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
arm the way you want and it's going to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.850 
arm the way you want and it's going to
want<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> move<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.580> lot<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.240> hinge<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.870> on

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
want to move a lot on this hinge and on

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.610 
want to move a lot on this hinge and on
this<00:03:08.460> hinge<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.930> got<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.260> play<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.500> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
this hinge so you got to play with that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.250 
this hinge so you got to play with that
a<00:03:10.680> little<00:03:10.830> bit<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.360> shoulder<00:03:12.720> does<00:03:12.930> rotate

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
a little bit the shoulder does rotate

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.750 
a little bit the shoulder does rotate
along<00:03:13.710> with<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.400> wheel<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.220> has<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.550> full

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
along with the wheel so it has the full

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.210 
along with the wheel so it has the full
range<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:18.030> motion<00:03:18.090> there<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.830> doing<00:03:20.010> it

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
range of motion there see it's doing it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.570 
range of motion there see it's doing it
right<00:03:20.310> now

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
right now

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.449 
right now
and<00:03:21.000> then<00:03:21.270> we<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:22.050> ball<00:03:22.590> joint<00:03:22.860> right

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
and then we have a ball joint right

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.580 
and then we have a ball joint right
there<00:03:23.550> which<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.150> suffices<00:03:24.660> or<00:03:25.170> works<00:03:25.380> as

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
there which really suffices or works as

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.580 
there which really suffices or works as
the<00:03:26.580> elbow<00:03:27.450> joint<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.840> as<00:03:27.959> our<00:03:28.050> shoulders<00:03:28.410> are

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
the elbow joint so as our shoulders are

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.800 
the elbow joint so as our shoulders are
kind<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> best<00:03:29.430> these<00:03:30.270> elbow<00:03:30.510> joints

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
kind of not the best these elbow joints

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.210 
kind of not the best these elbow joints
the<00:03:30.900> ball<00:03:31.050> joints<00:03:31.350> oh<00:03:31.440> that's<00:03:31.590> fine<00:03:31.890> and

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the ball joints oh that's fine and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.980 
the ball joints oh that's fine and
that's<00:03:33.090> really<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.510> for<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> articulation

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
that's really it for the articulation

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.620 
that's really it for the articulation
for<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> arm<00:03:34.830> we<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.520> some<00:03:35.730> rotation<00:03:36.270> here

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
for the arm we have some rotation here

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.740 
for the arm we have some rotation here
but<00:03:37.590> that's<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.340> hand<00:03:38.610> does<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.180> but

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
but that's it the hand does this but

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.550 
but that's it the hand does this but
that's<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.320> for<00:03:40.500> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
that's really just for the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.580 
that's really just for the
transformation<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.180> overall<00:03:42.989> we're<00:03:43.350> kind<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
transformation so overall we're kind of

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.590 
transformation so overall we're kind of
limited<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:44.070> articulation<00:03:44.370> what<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:45.300> would

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
limited on articulation what I would

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.810 
limited on articulation what I would
recommend<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.170> do<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.830> turn<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.370> arm<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.670> like

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
recommend you do is turn the arm in like

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.729 
recommend you do is turn the arm in like
I<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.000> did<00:03:48.390> leave<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.080> bend<00:03:49.560> at

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
I just did leave it like that bend at

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.310 
I just did leave it like that bend at
the<00:03:49.770> elbow<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.570> are<00:03:51.600> good<00:03:52.080> to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
the elbow like that and you are good to

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.199 
the elbow like that and you are good to
go<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.520> him<00:03:53.670> firing<00:03:53.940> his

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
go if you want to have him firing his

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.880 
go if you want to have him firing his
little<00:03:54.450> blaster<00:03:54.840> thing<00:03:55.080> go<00:03:55.260> ahead<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.590> rotate

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
little blaster thing go ahead and rotate

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.910 
little blaster thing go ahead and rotate
his<00:03:56.040> arm<00:03:56.190> forward<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:58.050> put<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.470> blaster<00:03:58.890> on

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
his arm forward and put the blaster on

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.770 
his arm forward and put the blaster on
and<00:03:59.520> he's<00:03:59.670> fine<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.390> even<00:04:00.570> though<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and he's fine so even though the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.960 
and he's fine so even though the
articulation<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.590> kind<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.980> limited<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:02.850> not

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
articulation is kind of limited it's not

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.600 
articulation is kind of limited it's not
too<00:04:03.150> bad<00:04:03.330> it's<00:04:04.340> effective<00:04:05.340> enough<00:04:06.050> it'll<00:04:07.050> work

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
too bad it's effective enough it'll work

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.540 
too bad it's effective enough it'll work
see<00:04:08.610> looks<00:04:09.060> good<00:04:09.270> okay<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.950> far<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.250> waist

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
see looks good okay as far as waist

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.670 
see looks good okay as far as waist
articulation<00:04:11.750> we<00:04:12.750> do<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.140> little<00:04:13.470> bit<00:04:13.590> of

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
articulation we do have a little bit of

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.410 
articulation we do have a little bit of
a<00:04:13.770> waist<00:04:13.980> twist<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.400> there<00:04:14.580> it's<00:04:15.060> kind<00:04:15.239> of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
a waist twist in there it's kind of

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.630 
a waist twist in there it's kind of
limited<00:04:15.810> but<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.590> there<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.549> is

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
limited but it is in there and it is

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.449 
limited but it is in there and it is
effective<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.359> that's<00:04:18.959> nice<00:04:19.459> hip

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
effective so that's nice hip

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.370 
effective so that's nice hip
articulation<00:04:20.669> same<00:04:21.419> as<00:04:21.630> we've<00:04:21.840> been<00:04:22.049> getting

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
articulation same as we've been getting

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.950 
articulation same as we've been getting
ball<00:04:22.979> joint<00:04:23.280> inside<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.820> head<00:04:23.970> itself<00:04:24.300> the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
ball joint inside the head itself the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.270 
ball joint inside the head itself the
thigh<00:04:25.200> swivel<00:04:25.680> goes

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
thigh swivel goes

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.850 
thigh swivel goes
unto<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:27.990> good<00:04:28.170> range<00:04:28.410> of<00:04:28.560> motion

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
unto that so a good range of motion

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.890 
unto that so a good range of motion
there<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.670> knee<00:04:29.910> joint<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.390> single<00:04:30.780> knee

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
there the knee joint is a single knee

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.650 
there the knee joint is a single knee
joint<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.500> it's<00:04:31.620> pretty<00:04:31.860> limited<00:04:32.390> that's<00:04:33.390> all

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
joint and it's pretty limited that's all

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.350 
joint and it's pretty limited that's all
you<00:04:33.810> get<00:04:33.960> out<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.440> he's<00:04:35.280> got<00:04:35.430> these<00:04:35.580> really

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
you get out of it he's got these really

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.630 
you get out of it he's got these really
blocky<00:04:36.630> lower<00:04:36.960> legs<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.590> they<00:04:38.160> block<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.430> lot

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
blocky lower legs and they block a lot

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.690 
blocky lower legs and they block a lot
of<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.850> articulation<00:04:39.560> they<00:04:40.560> also<00:04:40.740> give<00:04:41.460> him

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
of the articulation they also give him

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.120 
of the articulation they also give him
no<00:04:42.030> foot<00:04:42.450> articulation<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.650> foot<00:04:43.860> itself

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
no foot articulation the foot itself

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.930 
no foot articulation the foot itself
does<00:04:44.460> move<00:04:44.840> both<00:04:45.840> parts<00:04:46.230> move<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:47.520> front<00:04:47.700> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
does move both parts move the front and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.180 
does move both parts move the front and
the<00:04:48.060> back<00:04:48.210> but<00:04:48.690> due<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.900> this<00:04:49.200> you're<00:04:50.070> really

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
the back but due to this you're really

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.090 
the back but due to this you're really
not<00:04:50.370> going<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.550> get<00:04:50.700> much<00:04:50.880> out<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:52.530> it's

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
not going to get much out of it so it's

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.680 
not going to get much out of it so it's
not<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.400> best<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.670> articulation<00:04:54.390> but<00:04:54.540> it's

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
not the best for articulation but it's

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.380 
not the best for articulation but it's
effective<00:04:55.410> enough<00:04:55.680> really<00:04:56.550> if<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.970> shoulders

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
effective enough really if the shoulders

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.350 
effective enough really if the shoulders
were<00:04:57.570> better<00:04:57.780> I'd<00:04:58.320> be<00:04:58.350> ok<00:04:58.770> with<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:58.980> overall

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
were better I'd be ok with it overall

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.790 
were better I'd be ok with it overall
and<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.480> mean<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.720> still<00:05:00.870> am<00:05:00.930> but<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:01.530> wouldn't

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
and I mean I still am but I wouldn't

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.530 
and I mean I still am but I wouldn't
really<00:05:01.890> have<00:05:02.040> any<00:05:02.280> complaints<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.180> rest<00:05:03.360> is

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
really have any complaints the rest is

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.750 
really have any complaints the rest is
all<00:05:03.690> passable<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.530> overall<00:05:05.370> I'm<00:05:05.490> gonna<00:05:05.610> give

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
all passable so overall I'm gonna give

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.550 
all passable so overall I'm gonna give
this<00:05:05.880> guy<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.090> 9<00:05:06.450> out<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.660> 10<00:05:06.900> he<00:05:07.020> looks<00:05:07.200> great

this guy a 9 out of 10 he looks great

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.130 
this guy a 9 out of 10 he looks great
he's<00:05:08.400> almost<00:05:08.700> perfect<00:05:09.419> he<00:05:09.480> does<00:05:09.660> have<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> few

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
small issues but I can overlook them

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.780 
small issues but I can overlook them
just<00:05:12.930> because<00:05:13.230> he<00:05:13.320> does<00:05:13.500> look<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:13.890> nice<00:05:14.100> so

perfect<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:37.080> don't<00:05:37.260> get<00:05:37.530> why<00:05:37.650> they<00:05:37.800> made<00:05:37.979> that

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010

joint<00:05:38.520> silver<00:05:39.330> they<00:05:39.990> didn't<00:05:40.229> seem<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:40.410> be

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
joint silver they didn't seem to be

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.020 
joint silver they didn't seem to be
yellow<00:05:40.800> or<00:05:40.860> black<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.490> would<00:05:41.580> have<00:05:41.700> been<00:05:41.820> much

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
yellow or black it would have been much

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.480 
yellow or black it would have been much
nicer<00:05:42.090> if<00:05:42.690> it<00:05:42.780> matched<00:05:43.050> but<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.919> doesn't<00:05:44.310> so

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
nicer if it matched but it doesn't so

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.719 
nicer if it matched but it doesn't so
it's<00:05:45.120> not<00:05:45.240> perfect<00:05:45.690> but<00:05:46.080> no<00:05:46.290> big<00:05:46.530> deal<00:05:46.770> they

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
it's not perfect but no big deal they

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.400 
it's not perfect but no big deal they
even<00:05:47.850> panned<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.330> rotor<00:05:48.600> separately<00:05:49.260> in

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
even panned the rotor separately in

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.620 
even panned the rotor separately in
there<00:05:49.650> you<00:05:49.890> can<00:05:50.010> see<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.370> it's<00:05:50.490> silver<00:05:50.850> don't

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630

there you can see that it's silver don't
like<00:05:51.780> back<00:05:52.020> here<00:05:52.260> where<00:05:52.470> it's<00:05:52.620> all<00:05:52.740> yellow<00:05:53.150> it

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
like back here where it's all yellow it

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.969 
like back here where it's all yellow it
should<00:05:54.510> be<00:05:54.690> black<00:05:54.960> or<00:05:55.169> silver<00:05:55.320> in<00:05:55.620> there<00:05:55.770> but

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
should be black or silver in there but

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.280 
should be black or silver in there but

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
it looks pretty good we have the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.430

whatever that's supposed to be doesn't

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.490 
whatever that's supposed to be doesn't

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
look like an intake or a hood scoop it

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.110 
look like an intake or a hood scoop it
looks<00:06:22.650> like<00:06:22.800> part<00:06:23.040> of<00:06:23.070> an<00:06:23.190> engine<00:06:23.520> but<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.820> don't

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
looks like part of an engine but I don't

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.980 
looks like part of an engine but I don't
know<00:06:24.180> whatever<00:06:24.390> that's<00:06:24.660> supposed<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.900> be

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
know whatever that's supposed to be

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.530 
know whatever that's supposed to be
that's<00:06:25.200> there<00:06:25.470> clear<00:06:26.190> blue<00:06:26.430> glass<00:06:26.850> for<00:06:27.450> the

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
that's there clear blue glass for the

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.630 
that's there clear blue glass for the
windows<00:06:27.900> would<00:06:28.440> have<00:06:28.590> preferred<00:06:28.950> black<00:06:29.280> I'm

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
windows would have preferred black I'm

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.610 
windows would have preferred black I'm
not<00:06:29.790> sure<00:06:30.000> what<00:06:30.150> it<00:06:30.240> is<00:06:30.360> in<00:06:30.540> the<00:06:30.630> show<00:06:30.870> black

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
not sure what it is in the show black

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.870 
not sure what it is in the show black
would<00:06:31.770> look<00:06:31.919> better<00:06:32.100> if<00:06:32.340> it's<00:06:32.460> blue<00:06:32.669> in<00:06:32.790> the

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
would look better if it's blue in the

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.880 
would look better if it's blue in the
show<00:06:33.060> then<00:06:33.300> it's<00:06:33.450> fine<00:06:33.690> obviously<00:06:33.930> but<00:06:34.830> I

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
show then it's fine obviously but I

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.529 
show then it's fine obviously but I
think<00:06:34.919> black<00:06:35.280> looks<00:06:35.550> better<00:06:35.760> than<00:06:35.970> blue<00:06:36.240> so

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
think black looks better than blue so

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.300 
think black looks better than blue so
that<00:06:36.590> whatever<00:06:37.590> that's<00:06:37.860> just<00:06:38.070> a<00:06:38.130> personal

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
that whatever that's just a personal

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.270 
that whatever that's just a personal
