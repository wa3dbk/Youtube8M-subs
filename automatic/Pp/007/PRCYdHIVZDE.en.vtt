00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
alongside some minor tweaks I've thought

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.830 
alongside some minor tweaks I've thought
about<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.369> not<00:00:23.640> doing<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.240> update<00:00:24.510> video<00:00:24.660> on

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120 
about just not doing an update video on
this<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.350> was<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.680> minor<00:00:25.859> but

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
this one because it was really minor but

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
this one because it was really minor but
a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.910> guys<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> even

as I had discussed earlier we now have
specific<00:00:51.600> different<00:00:51.960> kinds<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.530> bushes<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
specific different kinds of bushes that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to place them in your own world you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.790 
to place them in your own world you
place<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:58.020> separate<00:00:58.620> different

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
place them down as separate different

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
place them down as separate different
resources<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> want

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
resources so you know like if you want

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
resources so you know like if you want
to<00:01:01.140> place<00:01:01.260> down<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> tree<00:01:01.800> that's<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> maple

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to place down a tree that's like a maple

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
to place down a tree that's like a maple
tree<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> mother<00:01:04.320> maple<00:01:04.650> tree

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
tree and that's like a mother maple tree

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
tree and that's like a mother maple tree
and<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.250> pine<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.850> each<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> these

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and that's a pine and each one of these

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.890 
and that's a pine and each one of these
individual<00:01:07.950> bushes<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.640> different<00:01:09.299> kinds<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
individual bushes are different kinds of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.050 
individual bushes are different kinds of
I<00:01:10.110> guess<00:01:10.320> trees<00:01:10.650> except<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.400> bushes<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I guess trees except these are bushes so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.600 
I guess trees except these are bushes so
I<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.330> them<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.689> down<00:01:12.720> left<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.710> some

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I put them all down left to right some

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.399 
I put them all down left to right some
of<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.060> dark<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> some<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.259> are

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of them are dark and some of them are

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
of them are dark and some of them are
light<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.920> color<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.700> dark<00:01:18.000> ones<00:01:18.299> are

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
light in color the dark ones are

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
light in color the dark ones are
poisonous<00:01:19.110> berries<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.100> light<00:01:20.310> ones<00:01:20.549> are

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
ones those berries have a very good

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
ones those berries have a very good
chance<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.270> screwing<00:02:21.230> up<00:02:21.470> your<00:02:21.620> game<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
chance of screwing up your game the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.610 
chance of screwing up your game the
lighter<00:02:22.640> ones<00:02:23.030> they<00:02:23.750> might<00:02:23.930> make<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.290> sick

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
but that's probably about it so here we

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.070 
but that's probably about it so here we
have<00:02:30.130> russet<00:02:31.130> berries<00:02:31.490> these<00:02:32.300> ones<00:02:32.540> will<00:02:32.810> harm

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080

have russet berries these ones will harm
you<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.530> then<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.310> have<00:02:35.740> muah<00:02:36.740> vay<00:02:36.980> berries

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
you and then we have muah vay berries

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.670 
you and then we have muah vay berries
however<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.120> want<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.360> say<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.780> these<00:02:39.350> ones

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
however you want to say that these ones

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.770 
however you want to say that these ones
are<00:02:39.890> good<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.640> let's<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.090> try<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.450> eat<00:02:41.540> these

now we've got the Jade berries came from
a<00:02:52.220> light<00:02:52.370> blush<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:52.910> are<00:02:53.090> safe<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.420> eat

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
a light blush so these are safe to eat

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
indigo berries came from a dark bush

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.380 
indigo berries came from a dark bush
probably<00:03:01.459> don't<00:03:01.580> want<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.730> eat<00:03:01.880> these<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
probably don't want to eat these and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.140 
probably don't want to eat these and
this<00:03:03.110> one<00:03:03.320> hello<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.160> light<00:03:04.430> bush<00:03:04.670> this

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
this one hello this is a light bush this

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.240 
this one hello this is a light bush this
one's<00:03:05.330> kind<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.570> halfway<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.110> between<00:03:06.250> so

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
one's kind of halfway in between so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.790 
one's kind of halfway in between so
maybe<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.760> good<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.209> bad<00:03:08.410> amber<00:03:09.410> berries

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
maybe this is good and bad amber berries

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.560 
maybe this is good and bad amber berries
let's<00:03:10.190> eat<00:03:10.459> these<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.970> see<00:03:11.300> what<00:03:11.450> they're

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
let's eat these and see what they're

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.880 
let's eat these and see what they're
like<00:03:11.600> oh<00:03:13.540> dear<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.170> I'm<00:03:15.290> assuming<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.739> that's

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
like oh dear so I'm assuming that that's

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.770 
like oh dear so I'm assuming that that's
a<00:03:16.070> bad<00:03:16.100> bush<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.090> kind<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.330> halfway<00:03:17.540> in

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
a bad bush but it's kind of halfway in

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.540 
a bad bush but it's kind of halfway in
between<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.530> makes<00:03:19.010> sense<00:03:19.070> because<00:03:19.370> it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
between and that makes sense because it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.160 
between and that makes sense because it
makes<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.850> hallucinate<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.840> if<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.019> look

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
makes you hallucinate but if you look

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.660 
makes you hallucinate but if you look
down<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.560> also<00:03:21.830> helped<00:03:22.040> my<00:03:22.160> hunger<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.640> thirst

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
down it also helped my hunger and thirst

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.400 
down it also helped my hunger and thirst
so<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.120> kind<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.450> half<00:03:23.600> way<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:23.900> between<00:03:23.930> so

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
so it's kind of a half way in between so

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.080 
so it's kind of a half way in between so
that's<00:03:24.560> why<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.160> was<00:03:25.190> kind<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:25.970> an

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
that's why that one was kind of an

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.640 
that's why that one was kind of an
in-between<00:03:26.540> dark<00:03:26.810> green<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.260> light<00:03:27.350> green

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
in-between dark green and light green

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.280 
in-between dark green and light green
these<00:03:28.280> are<00:03:28.489> just<00:03:28.670> pure<00:03:28.850> dark<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.170> other

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
these are just pure dark and the other

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.979 
these are just pure dark and the other
ones<00:03:30.500> are<00:03:30.650> very<00:03:30.950> light<00:03:31.250> green<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.269> anyway

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
ones are very light green so anyway

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.479 
ones are very light green so anyway
those<00:03:33.500> are<00:03:33.560> all<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.890> different<00:03:34.160> berries

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
those are all the different berries

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.430 
those are all the different berries

effect on on rag dolls compared to these
two<00:04:06.980> weapons<00:04:07.400> because<00:04:07.970> supposedly<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.600> more

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
two weapons because supposedly the more

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.890 
two weapons because supposedly the more
pellets<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.170> are<00:04:09.320> shooting<00:04:09.500> into<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:10.130> zombie

pellets you are shooting into a zombie

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.330 
pellets you are shooting into a zombie
the<00:04:11.900> more<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.170> will<00:04:12.260> fly<00:04:12.650> around<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.130> more

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
the more it will fly around the more

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.730 
the more it will fly around the more
physical<00:04:13.520> force<00:04:14.120> according<00:04:14.480> to

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
physical force according to

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.990 
physical force according to
the<00:04:15.770> update<00:04:16.040> post<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.430> I'm<00:04:16.489> assuming<00:04:16.880> that

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
the update post and I'm assuming that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.400 
the update post and I'm assuming that
that<00:04:17.030> means<00:04:17.420> more<00:04:17.920> rag<00:04:18.920> doll<00:04:19.250> ish<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.410> I'm

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
that means more rag doll ish and I'm

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.190 
that means more rag doll ish and I'm
going<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.620> also<00:04:21.770> use<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:23.210> boost<00:04:23.420> in<00:04:23.720> addition

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
going to also use the boost in addition

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.990 
going to also use the boost in addition
to<00:04:24.380> just<00:04:24.890> shooting<00:04:25.340> them<00:04:25.460> with<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.670> shotgun

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
to just shooting them with a shotgun

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.570 
to just shooting them with a shotgun
normally<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.320> way<00:04:27.470> they'll<00:04:28.460> go

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
normally it's in that way they'll go

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.300 
normally it's in that way they'll go
flying<00:04:28.970> like<00:04:29.480> really<00:04:30.110> far<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:30.800> first<00:04:31.100> off

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
flying like really far so first off

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.190 
flying like really far so first off
let's<00:04:31.820> test<00:04:32.090> out<00:04:32.270> what<00:04:32.450> happens<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.840> these<00:04:32.930> rag

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
let's test out what happens to these rag

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.530 
let's test out what happens to these rag
dolls<00:04:33.440> when<00:04:34.010> we<00:04:34.130> shoot<00:04:34.340> them<00:04:34.490> with<00:04:34.550> an<00:04:34.940> eagle

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
dolls when we shoot them with an eagle

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.280 
dolls when we shoot them with an eagle
fire<00:04:35.840> or<00:04:36.140> a<00:04:36.170> r32<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:38.000> that's<00:04:38.750> good<00:04:38.930> let's<00:04:39.200> get

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
fire or a r32 so that's good let's get

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.960 
fire or a r32 so that's good let's get
him<00:04:39.350> away<00:04:39.500> snow<00:04:39.950> we<00:04:40.070> don't<00:04:40.550> get<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.730> ton<00:04:40.910> of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
him away snow we don't get a ton of

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.910 
him away snow we don't get a ton of
zombies<00:04:41.390> on<00:04:41.540> me<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.230> shoot<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.560> guy<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.830> the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
from normal heights ciao oh I don't know

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.150 
from normal heights ciao oh I don't know
if<00:05:47.090> you<00:05:47.180> can<00:05:47.270> see<00:05:47.510> him<00:05:47.660> but<00:05:47.840> he<00:05:48.140> flew<00:05:48.620> over<00:05:49.040> the

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
if you can see him but he flew over the

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.390 
if you can see him but he flew over the
hill<00:05:49.420> you<00:05:50.420> flew<00:05:50.720> way<00:05:50.990> over<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.500> hill<00:05:51.530> if<00:05:52.280> you

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
hill you flew way over the hill if you

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.080 
hill you flew way over the hill if you
get<00:05:52.550> all<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:53.240> pellets<00:05:53.600> in<00:05:53.810> they're<00:05:54.680> gone<00:05:55.090> I

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090

guess you could see their whole go from
this<00:05:59.450> angle<00:06:00.490> look<00:06:01.490> at<00:06:01.640> that<00:06:01.820> he<00:06:02.810> just

that was an exception he just flew into

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.200 
that was an exception he just flew into
space<00:06:33.860> but<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:35.340> know<00:06:35.460> sometimes<00:06:35.789> that'll

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
space but you know sometimes that'll

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.850

really flying compared to using the

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.589 
really flying compared to using the
shock<00:06:59.190> and<00:07:00.949> where<00:07:01.949> I<00:07:01.979> send<00:07:02.370> him<00:07:02.580> into<00:07:02.819> another

shock and where I send him into another

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:06.020 
shock and where I send him into another
dimension<00:07:03.840> and<00:07:04.770> I'm<00:07:04.889> a<00:07:04.979> lot<00:07:05.159> of<00:07:05.280> bullets<00:07:05.639> but

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030
