about<00:00:44.910> there's<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.539> sort<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> alien<00:00:46.079> theory

oh<00:00:46.950> okay<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.030> well<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> object<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
oh okay that well you know the object is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
oh okay that well you know the object is
about<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> size<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> Robo<00:00:50.489> Rose<00:00:50.850> Bowl

stadium<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> too<00:00:52.260> small<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> planet

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
stadium so it's too small to be a planet

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.400 
stadium so it's too small to be a planet
or<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> star<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.940> galaxy<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
or a star or a galaxy and it's not a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
comment there's no gas in the tale that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
comment there's no gas in the tale that
comment<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> meteor<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.520> it's

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
comment it's not a meteor because it's

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
comment it's not a meteor because it's
not<00:01:00.059> inside<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.899> Earth's<00:01:01.109> atmosphere<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
not inside the Earth's atmosphere so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.969 
not inside the Earth's atmosphere so
what<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:03.899> scratching<00:01:04.170> our<00:01:04.439> head<00:01:04.739> the

what is it we're scratching our head the
only<00:01:05.400> thing<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.360> at<00:01:06.479> the

only thing we can think of at the

only thing we can think of at the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
present time is a once-in-a-lifetime

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.260 
present time is a once-in-a-lifetime
event<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.869> collision<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:11.130> asteroids<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
event the collision of two asteroids in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.660 
event the collision of two asteroids in
space<00:01:12.299> we've<00:01:12.750> never<00:01:13.020> seen<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> before

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
space we've never seen that before

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
space we've never seen that before
creating<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.909> starburst<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.930> starburst<00:01:16.530> of

creating a starburst the starburst of
debris<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.420> theory<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> correct<00:01:19.140> it

debris and if that theory is correct it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280 
debris and if that theory is correct it
means<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.369> weeks<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.420> starfish<00:01:22.080> should

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
means with the weeks the starfish should

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.899 
means with the weeks the starfish should
get<00:01:22.409> bigger<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> bigger<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> eventually

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
get bigger and bigger and eventually

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
get bigger and bigger and eventually
fade<00:01:24.390> away<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.020> asteroid<00:01:25.530> collision<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
fade away so the asteroid collision it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
fade away so the asteroid collision it
may<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.670> happened<00:01:27.060> before<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
may have happened before we just have

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
may have happened before we just have
not<00:01:28.320> seen<00:01:28.380> evidence<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
not seen evidence of it this is the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.030 
not seen evidence of it this is the
first<00:01:30.090> time<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.570> been<00:01:30.720> caught<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.200> camera<00:01:31.259> if

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
first time it's been caught on camera if

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
first time it's been caught on camera if
it<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.729> asteroid<00:01:33.090> collision<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:34.110> would

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it is an asteroid collision what would

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.929 
it is an asteroid collision what would
that<00:01:34.320> mean<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.860> folks<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.790> would

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that mean to folks like you you would

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.819 
that mean to folks like you you would
study<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.630> figure<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.350> makes<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
study that to figure out what makes you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.950 
study that to figure out what makes you
well<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.460> realize<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> asteroids<00:01:39.720> are

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
well we realize that asteroids are

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
well we realize that asteroids are
predictable<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.979> exactly<00:01:41.280> where<00:01:41.640> they

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
predictable we know exactly where they

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
predictable we know exactly where they
are<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.600> around<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.200> Sun<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.740> they

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
are going around the Sun but if they

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.730 
are going around the Sun but if they
collide<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.240> game-changer<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:46.470> think

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710 
collide it's a game-changer we think
that<00:01:46.920> may<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.189> wiped<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> dinosaurs

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that may have wiped out the dinosaurs

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
that may have wiped out the dinosaurs
there<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> cosmic<00:01:50.070> collision<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.970> 100

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
there was a cosmic collision about 100

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
there was a cosmic collision about 100
million<00:01:51.540> years<00:01:51.689> ago<00:01:51.840> debris<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:53.100> sent<00:01:53.399> all

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
million years ago debris was sent all

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.209 
million years ago debris was sent all
over<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.090> asteroid<00:01:54.570> belt<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.259> piece<00:01:55.560> get

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
over the asteroid belt and one piece get

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.880 
over the asteroid belt and one piece get
this<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.969> piece<00:01:57.270> hit<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.899> earth<00:01:58.079> from<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
this one piece hit the earth from that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
this one piece hit the earth from that
collision<00:01:59.219> about<00:01:59.549> 65<00:02:00.119> million<00:02:00.360> years<00:02:00.479> ago<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
collision about 65 million years ago and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.149 
collision about 65 million years ago and
that's<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> dinosaurs<00:02:02.759> died<00:02:03.630> in

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
that's when the dinosaurs died in

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.370 
that's when the dinosaurs died in
perhaps<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.579> year<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
perhaps just one year so we think that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.590 
perhaps just one year so we think that
an<00:02:07.530> asteroid<00:02:07.950> collision<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.819> big<00:02:09.090> one

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
an asteroid collision a big one

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.390 
an asteroid collision a big one
wiped<00:02:09.900> out<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.230> dinosaurs<00:02:10.380> Wow<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
wiped out the dinosaurs Wow so that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.980 
wiped out the dinosaurs Wow so that
would<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.550> significant<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
would be significant for people like you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.510 
would be significant for people like you
because<00:02:13.290> what<00:02:13.440> Apple<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.980> guess<00:02:14.130> some<00:02:14.310> folks

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
because what Apple is I guess some folks

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.460 
because what Apple is I guess some folks
saw<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.910> deep<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.240> space<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:15.720> said<00:02:15.990> you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
saw this deep in space and they said you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.870 
saw this deep in space and they said you
need<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.620> check<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.950> out<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.490> we<00:02:17.610> took<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
need to check that out so we took the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.940 
need to check that out so we took the
Hubble<00:02:18.150> telescope<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.350> point<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.770> this

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
Hubble telescope and we point in this

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.320 
Hubble telescope and we point in this
direction<00:02:20.460> now<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.880> these<00:02:21.030> brilliant

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
direction now we have these brilliant

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.450 
direction now we have these brilliant
pictures<00:02:22.020> let's<00:02:22.470> try<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.800> month<00:02:23.040> ago<00:02:23.160> we

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
pictures let's try it a month ago we

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.370 
pictures let's try it a month ago we
spot<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.880> little<00:02:24.180> speck<00:02:24.570> doing<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.050> sorts

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
spot this little speck doing all sorts

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.600 
spot this little speck doing all sorts
of<00:02:25.470> shenanigans<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.310> shouldn't<00:02:26.550> be

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
of shenanigans that it shouldn't be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.790 
of shenanigans that it shouldn't be
doing<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.360> Hubble<00:02:27.630> Space<00:02:27.660> Telescope<00:02:27.900> zooms

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
doing the Hubble Space Telescope zooms

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.400 
doing the Hubble Space Telescope zooms
in<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.940> are<00:02:30.180> jaws<00:02:30.780> hit<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.230> floor

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
in on it and we are jaws hit the floor

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.010 
in on it and we are jaws hit the floor
at<00:02:32.040> some<00:02:32.280> point<00:02:32.610> we're<00:02:32.790> saying<00:02:33.090> now<00:02:33.810> it's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
at some point we're saying now it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.230 
at some point we're saying now it's
called<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> P<00:02:34.800> slash<00:02:35.700> 2010<00:02:36.510> a2<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.000> say

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
called the P slash 2010 a2 and you say

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.880 
called the P slash 2010 a2 and you say
that<00:02:39.450> short<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:40.050> we<00:02:40.620> are<00:02:40.950> clueless<00:02:42.890> nicely

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that short for we are clueless nicely

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.590 
that short for we are clueless nicely
done<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> learn<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.210> lot<00:02:45.360> more

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
done so we have to learn a lot more

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.750 
done so we have to learn a lot more
about<00:02:45.750> these<00:02:45.900> asteroid<00:02:46.440> collisions<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.070> lot

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
about these asteroid collisions a lot

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.370 
about these asteroid collisions a lot
about<00:02:47.970> our<00:02:48.120> future<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:48.900> right<00:02:49.140> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
about our future that's right and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.600 
about our future that's right and
they're<00:02:49.500> random<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.010> don't<00:02:50.040> know<00:02:50.250> where<00:02:50.490> they

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
they're random we don't know where they

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
they're random we don't know where they
come<00:02:50.790> from<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.960> debris<00:02:52.350> hits<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
come from and if the debris hits the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.280 
come from and if the debris hits the
earth<00:02:53.040> are<00:02:53.340> unpredictable<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.330> we<00:02:54.900> think<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
earth are unpredictable and we think the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 
earth are unpredictable and we think the
dinosaurs<00:02:55.770> got<00:02:55.950> wiped<00:02:56.010> out<00:02:56.460> precisely<00:02:56.940> in

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
dinosaurs got wiped out precisely in

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.510 
dinosaurs got wiped out precisely in
this<00:02:57.540> way<00:02:57.750> only<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:58.650> had<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.100> Hubble

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
this way only if they had the Hubble

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.140 
this way only if they had the Hubble
come<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.800> Tuesday<00:03:01.800> night<00:03:02.160> ten<00:03:02.520> o'clock<00:03:02.610> check

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
come on Tuesday night ten o'clock check

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.400 
come on Tuesday night ten o'clock check
him<00:03:03.270> out<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> Science<00:03:03.960> Channel<00:03:04.020> I'll<00:03:04.290> meet

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
him out in the Science Channel I'll meet

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.230 
him out in the Science Channel I'll meet
you<00:03:04.590> thank<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.950> very<00:03:04.980> much<00:03:05.370> good<00:03:05.880> night<00:03:05.910> it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
you thank you very much good night it
