very well embroidered let's see how this
mechanism<00:00:31.109> works<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.300> see

collapse on you which we have found in

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.340 
collapse on you which we have found in
testing<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.510> that<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.750> its<00:01:13.049> full<00:01:13.320> length

the longest ball retriever I've ever
seen<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.110> should<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> job<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:21.600> retract

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
seen but it should do the job to retract

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.420 
seen but it should do the job to retract
it<00:01:22.759> loosen<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.950> like

it loosen and all the way down but like
I've<00:01:26.640> done<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.420> forget<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> tighten

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I've done here don't forget to tighten

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.789 
I've done here don't forget to tighten

we<00:01:53.759> found<00:01:54.030> while<00:01:54.210> testing<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.659> product<00:01:54.899> that

we found while testing this product that
there's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.310> real<00:01:56.490> chance<00:01:56.820> when<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> say

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
there's a very real chance when I say

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
there's a very real chance when I say
will<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.500> mean<00:01:58.799> we've<00:01:58.950> done<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.640> trapping

will I mean we've done it of trapping

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.800 
will I mean we've done it of trapping
