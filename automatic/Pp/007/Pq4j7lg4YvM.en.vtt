00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
little bit more interesting now I might

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.399 
little bit more interesting now I might
fiddle<00:02:45.569> with<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.930> little<00:02:46.079> bit<00:02:46.230> more

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
fiddle with it a little bit more

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.170 
fiddle with it a little bit more
