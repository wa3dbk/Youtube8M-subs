00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.410
 let's learn how to make the base sleeve 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.230
 The first thing we do is find out the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.410
 travel of the armhole of the back and the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.950
 of the striker once the most found 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.770
 we add it in this case my armhole 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.830
 front is 22 centimeters and that of the 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.160
 back 20 centimeters over there 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:35.019
 outline found three quarters 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 of 42 and I get a rectangle the width 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.890
 for the long 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 Once this rectangle is made, we find 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.690
 half 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.770
 we mark the lowering of the cup that would be a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.290
 middle of the route of the armholes 21 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.290
 centimeters and we mark it diagonally 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 Once we have done both 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.859
 diagonal we make a parallel to the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.859
 top part 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.920
 to make the crown of the sleeve we 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.680
 we mark at the top a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.590
 Travel tenth ie armhole 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.259
 four centimeters to the side and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.810
 four centimeters to the other side and 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.289
 at the bottom where the line is 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.899
 of the cup lowering we marked ourselves in the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.350
 back one - twentieth 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.990
 Travel armhole is , two and one 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.759
 the other side a tenth of the way 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.759
 sisa four with one 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.570
 we make a line parallel to the height 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.570
 Of elbow 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.709
 and we scored two points to two 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.709
 centimeters on each side 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.440
 let's mark the cuff I in this 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.230
 case I'm going to use 21 centimeters and you 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.300
 I have to subtract the outline of the sleeve 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.180
 those 21 centimeters I would subtract 10 and the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.850
 divide them by 2 would be 5 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.510
 centimeters that I have to put in each 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.349
 side 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.560
 once marked my sleeve 1 from the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.319
 bottom part going through the elbow until 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.799
 the top part to make the shape 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.709
 of the crown we make the diagonal 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.959
 joining the points of the cup lowering 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.810
 with those who had marked in the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.600
 from above and we are doing the form 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.740
 of the crown 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.740
 and from the armhole 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.760
 with a curved ruler 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.920
 once you have done it 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.920
 we arrange the form well 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.330
 and calc ice or brings the skeleton 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.610

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.510
