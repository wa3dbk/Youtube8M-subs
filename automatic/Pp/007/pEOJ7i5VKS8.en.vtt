okay<00:00:00.659> here's<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.050> two<00:00:01.199> camshaft<00:00:01.800> gears

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.330 
okay here's the two camshaft gears

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay here's the two camshaft gears
timing<00:00:03.330> chain<00:00:03.600> going<00:00:04.230> around<00:00:04.560> its<00:00:04.830> really

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
timing chain going around its really

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.720 
timing chain going around its really
tight<00:00:05.370> between<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.970> two<00:00:06.120> years<00:00:07.460> then<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.580> goes

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
tight between the two years then it goes

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.100 
tight between the two years then it goes
all<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.030> way<00:00:09.150> down<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.690> that's<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
all the way down here that's the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.160 
all the way down here that's the
water-pump<00:00:10.620> gear<00:00:10.950> right<00:00:11.219> there

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
water-pump gear right there

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.379 
water-pump gear right there
coming<00:00:13.170> over<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.679> comes<00:00:13.920> down<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:15.000> you

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
coming over here it comes down and you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.880 
coming over here it comes down and you
can<00:00:15.509> see<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> stub<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.289> right<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.680> there's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
can see the stub out right there there's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.330 
can see the stub out right there there's
the<00:00:17.210> crank<00:00:18.210> shaft<00:00:18.529> gear<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.800> down<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.279> on

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the crank shaft gear way down there on

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.910 
the crank shaft gear way down there on
the<00:00:20.430> bottom<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> car<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.230> what's<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.800> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the bottom of the car so what's going on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.759 
the bottom of the car so what's going on
here<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:24.000> I'll<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.769> start

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
here as I'll go down here and start

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.020 
here as I'll go down here and start
cranking<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.279> engine<00:00:29.310> over<00:00:31.279> my<00:00:32.279> socket

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
cranking the engine over my socket

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.340 
cranking the engine over my socket
wrench<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:36.660> does<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
wrench and right now see how does that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340 
wrench and right now see how does that
gene<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.010> pretty<00:00:38.280> tight<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.110> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
gene is pretty tight there and on this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.170 
gene is pretty tight there and on this
side<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> tensioner<00:00:42.320> right<00:00:43.320> there

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
side this is the tensioner right there

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.500 
side this is the tensioner right there
that's<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.450> tensioner<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.350> tensioner<00:00:46.829> shoe

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
that's the tensioner the tensioner shoe

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.850 
that's the tensioner the tensioner shoe
comes<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> goes<00:00:48.989> around<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.620> pretty

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
comes up and goes around it's pretty

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.410 
comes up and goes around it's pretty
tight<00:00:50.160> well<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.610> fairly<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.270> it's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
tight well that's fairly actually it's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
tight well that's fairly actually it's
kind<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.719> loose<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.469> too<00:00:52.710> bad

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
kind of loose it's not too bad

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880 
kind of loose it's not too bad
and<00:00:54.210> I'll<00:00:54.390> start<00:00:54.719> cranking<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> over<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and I'll start cranking it over and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.580 
and I'll start cranking it over and
you'll<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> chain<00:00:56.640> getting<00:00:57.230> down<00:00:58.230> here

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you'll see the chain getting down here

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.220 
you'll see the chain getting down here
on<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.070> end<00:00:59.340> getting<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.910> loose<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
on this end getting the loose on this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.340 
on this end getting the loose on this
side<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.210> then<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.480> tight<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.110> side

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
side and then very tight on this side

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
side and then very tight on this side
and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.070> I'll<00:01:05.790> crank<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> another<00:01:06.450> half<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and then I'll crank it another half a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.560 
and then I'll crank it another half a
turn<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:11.330> it'll<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
turn and it will be it'll be the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.030 
turn and it will be it'll be the
opposite<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.500> tight<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
opposite will be really tight on the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.999 
opposite will be really tight on the
shoe<00:01:14.280> side<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.540> loose<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.009> this

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
shoe side and then really loose on this

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.450 
shoe side and then really loose on this
side<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.920> better<00:01:23.130> right

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
side here so so I could get better right

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:35.390 
side here so so I could get better right
on<00:01:28.520> camera<00:01:29.520> che

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.270 

so<00:01:36.400> now<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:37.180> see<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.770> camera<00:01:39.160> is<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.250> little

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
so now you see the camera is a little

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.330 
so now you see the camera is a little
out<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.520> focus<00:01:39.790> here<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:41.920> see<00:01:42.070> how<00:01:42.190> much

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
out of focus here you can see how much

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:51.300 
out of focus here you can see how much
slop<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:44.170> on<00:01:44.470> this<00:01:44.680> side<00:01:46.350> quite<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> bit<00:01:50.160> if<00:01:51.160> I

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
slop is on this side quite a bit if I

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.830 
slop is on this side quite a bit if I
could<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.610> flop<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.060> around<00:01:52.270> like<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.510> that

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
could just flop it around like that that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.410 
could just flop it around like that that
does<00:01:53.050> not<00:01:53.080> seem<00:01:53.530> good<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.800> on<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.400> side<00:01:54.700> here

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
does not seem good and on this side here

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.510 
does not seem good and on this side here
it's<00:01:55.780> hard<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.140> see<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.500> but<00:01:56.650> it<00:01:56.800> is<00:01:56.830> tight<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.490> a

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
it's hard to see it but it is tight as a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
it's hard to see it but it is tight as a
whistle<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:01.660> I'll<00:02:01.750> keep<00:02:01.930> turning<00:02:02.320> around<00:02:02.910> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
whistle so I'll keep turning around and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.230 
whistle so I'll keep turning around and
now<00:02:05.680> it's<00:02:05.950> super<00:02:06.190> tight<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.760> this<00:02:07.000> side<00:02:07.330> and

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
now it's super tight on this side and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.790 
now it's super tight on this side and
fairly<00:02:10.240> loose<00:02:10.479> but<00:02:10.840> not<00:02:10.869> too<00:02:11.230> bad<00:02:11.440> on<00:02:11.620> this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
fairly loose but not too bad on this

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.170 
fairly loose but not too bad on this
side<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.740> I'm<00:02:14.920> working<00:02:15.340> against<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.970> valve

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
side and I'm working against the valve

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.260 
side and I'm working against the valve
springs<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.490> pistons<00:02:18.490> as<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.970> turns

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
springs and the pistons as this turns

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.080 
springs and the pistons as this turns
around<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.490> see<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.760> gets<00:02:21.910> loose

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
around but you can see it gets loose

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.560 
around but you can see it gets loose
again

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
again

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.660 
again
and<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.260> think<00:02:23.530> that's<00:02:23.709> got<00:02:24.010> way<00:02:24.220> too<00:02:24.250> much

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
and I think that's got way too much

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:35.880 
and I think that's got way too much
plate<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.709> right<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.709> if<00:02:35.800> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
plate in it right there so and that if I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.800 
plate in it right there so and that if I
go<00:02:36.070> around<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.910> gets<00:02:37.060> tighter<00:02:37.390> now

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
go around you know it gets tighter now

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.920 
go around you know it gets tighter now
