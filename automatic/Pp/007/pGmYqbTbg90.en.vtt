00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.259
 he called this place tonight 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.880
 disco an absolutely term 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:24.660
 simplistic because the whose ruined in 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 reality is much more to the management 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 of the disco console which 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 we meet the dj gianluca pighin 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.399
 tonight we opened the season 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 winter was a beautiful evening 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.180
 there's still a lot of people inside 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 local the amazing show with a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.730
 really exceptional set up has 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.260
 given the best of himself because he is a horse 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 so big in a place you never are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.410
 seen and I think it was a great one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410
 success 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.250
 call whose clubbing simply 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.480
 disco is correct here is not a 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 disco because call it alone 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.909
 disco is an understatement like everything 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.210
 rightly it is a show in the sense 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.790
 which the music contains the dancers 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.220
 top level dj performers e 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.430
 however a quality of service too 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.520
 simply selected waiters 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.080
 with great care we take care of everything 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.630
 this safe place all there is one 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.940
 great in manic I would say under so many 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.940
 aspects and many locals are not like that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.670
 how the shows are organized 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.920
 that we see alternating during the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.409
 season shows some here from 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.179
 we are mainly characterized 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.460
 from a production that is almost at the level 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.649
 theatrical because they are not improvised by 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 two or three dancers than the night before 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.880
 of the evening they improvise choreographies 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.869
 and music we have people who work everything 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.070
 the year 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.899
 even already from these states us 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.299
 we have about twenty shows already 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.439
 products with choreographed music that 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.439
 have already studied have already tried 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.130
 music and show some club bing in 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 How come together to say the disco 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 which in my opinion is not an exact thing 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.230
 it is reductive because people do 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.850
 amuse the music is a part 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.420
 very important of the evening but the show 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.440
 engages in an almost natural way 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.980
 during the whole evening because 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.910
 we have a sophisticated music product e 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.090
 the show however from a sort of breath 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.100
 the evening and an added value that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.260
 many locals fail to do 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.020
 especially because they don't have the basics and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.680
 they don't have a backstage so well 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.680
 organized 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 what are your expectations for 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.120
 2012 2013 season 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.880
 I would say that the expectations for the new one 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.750
 2012 season 2013 are or higher than 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.239
 that of last year 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.130
 I don't say anything yet because we are 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.760
 closing various dates with very guest 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.760
 important 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 in addition to hosting big names 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.270
 international clubs whose clubbing makes use of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.790
 of important collaboration 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.520
 Italian console professionals 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.200
 the Italians we have already said that 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.959
 our internal staff our three 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.030
 accident they are very very good they are 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.420
 very high level because anyway between 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.870
 the crest and other DJs die 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.220
 they rotate inside the structure 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.220
 I would say that the highest level because 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.170
 I'm not a second-floor resident 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.650
 dj that at national level anyway 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.650
 they have their say 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.090
 at the microphone to animate the opening party 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.879
 of the disco where we find faber 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.079
 renowned Italian vocalist exact 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.850
 they start the season tonight 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.120
 inauguration I put the jacket on 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.479
 how nice a seratone is this then not 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.570
 knows how to see from images by will of 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.449
 wave the owner 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.039
 there is a beautiful trojan horse that 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.780
 you will see at work that says there is a 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.639
 lots of surprises this horse 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.639
 must-see stuff to see absolutely 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.430
 what expectations for this evening of 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.900
 opening we are given we are growing in 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.910
 which serious remains a certainty 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.699
 absolute they are no longer for northern Italy 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.580
 but for all of Italy it is a real flower 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.280
 the pride of nightlife and this 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:16.680
 night is replied to the 2012 2013 season 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:18.750
 we are very loaded what can you tell us 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.660
 of the console of this open in parts 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.139
 of the clubbing a large console together 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.020
 a faber voice I will accompany to the sounds of 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.389
 great artists as rightly already 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.470
 see you there is gianluca pini who is 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.880
 opening 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.669
 right now right after that 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.370
 luca cassani and gianni morri artists who 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.650
 they don't need so many presentations 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.430
 we will have fun and a lot too 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.430
 Yup 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.880
 if I asked you to describe whose 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.670
 clubbing in a word like it 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.970
 describe the clubbing in a word 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.680
 is really the right choice in 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.380
 meaning that it is a club that has believed right away 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.720
 from the beginning not only on 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.500
 let's call it dance entertainment 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.510
 so therefore only its music 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.660
 have pushed a lot for this there are 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.220
 notable international artists too 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.380
 who come to stop at two clubs which 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.560
 but especially invested 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.310
 resources and energy for the same 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.310
 show 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.520
