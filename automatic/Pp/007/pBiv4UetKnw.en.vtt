00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and the activity light one thing I don't

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.559 
and the activity light one thing I don't
understand<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.110> why<00:02:10.289> they<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.890> activity

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
understand is why they have the activity

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.630 
understand is why they have the activity
in<00:02:11.689> the<00:02:11.840> back<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.230> hard<00:02:12.379> drive<00:02:12.640> because

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
in the back of the hard drive because

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.910 
in the back of the hard drive because
the<00:02:13.969> way<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.090> have<00:02:14.480> my<00:02:14.689> hard<00:02:14.900> drive<00:02:15.109> facing<00:02:15.739> is

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the way I have my hard drive facing is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.339 
the way I have my hard drive facing is
my<00:02:16.639> desk<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:16.999> facing<00:02:17.540> from<00:02:17.780> front<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.859> back<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
my desk is facing from front to back so

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.709 
my desk is facing from front to back so
you<00:02:21.349> know<00:02:21.469> it's<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.459> my<00:02:22.609> front<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.239> back<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.689> I

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
you know it's on my front to back so I

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.989 
you know it's on my front to back so I
can't<00:02:24.170> see<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.499> activity<00:02:24.739> light<00:02:25.069> so<00:02:25.700> i<00:02:25.730> don't

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:25.999 
can't see the activity light so i don't

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.059 
can't see the activity light so i don't
know<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.689> actually<00:02:27.019> doing<00:02:27.290> work<00:02:27.409> or<00:02:27.920> it's

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
know if it's actually doing work or it's

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.610 
know if it's actually doing work or it's
idle<00:02:28.459> or<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:29.000> shut<00:02:29.299> off<00:02:29.329> you<00:02:29.629> know<00:02:29.750> because

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
idle or is it shut off you know because

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.619 
idle or is it shut off you know because
this<00:02:30.950> thing<00:02:31.159> is<00:02:31.189> really<00:02:31.430> really<00:02:31.700> quiet<00:02:31.909> so<00:02:32.329> i

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
this thing is really really quiet so i

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.020 
this thing is really really quiet so i
can't<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.319> tell<00:02:33.739> what's<00:02:33.950> going<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.340> last<00:02:34.909> I

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
can't really tell what's going on last I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.240 
can't really tell what's going on last I
see<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.209> activity<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.069> it's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
see the activity like you know and it's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.440 
see the activity like you know and it's
in<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> back<00:02:37.639> so<00:02:37.819> it<00:02:37.879> doesn't<00:02:38.150> really<00:02:38.239> make

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
in the back so it doesn't really make

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.860 
in the back so it doesn't really make
sense<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.900> me<00:02:38.930> why<00:02:39.260> they<00:02:39.409> have<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> bag

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
sense to me why they have it in the bag

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.349 
sense to me why they have it in the bag
anyways<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.560> back<00:02:42.760> plastic<00:02:43.760> might<00:02:44.090> finish

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
anyways on the back plastic might finish

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.800 
anyways on the back plastic might finish
four<00:02:45.169> rubber<00:02:45.379> feet<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:46.489> what<00:02:46.909> information<00:02:47.419> but

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
four rubber feet in what information but

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.140 
four rubber feet in what information but
yeah<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.230> thing<00:02:48.469> sits<00:02:48.829> very<00:02:49.069> good<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.549> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
yeah this thing sits very good on the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.780 
yeah this thing sits very good on the
desk<00:02:50.389> and<00:02:50.750> whatever<00:02:51.260> surface<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.099> are<00:02:52.340> going

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
desk and whatever surface you are going

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.119 
desk and whatever surface you are going
to<00:02:52.849> put<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.329> here<00:02:53.680> it's<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:54.889> going<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
to put this on here it's not going to

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.640 
to put this on here it's not going to
move<00:02:55.219> or<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.579> anything<00:02:55.819> like<00:02:55.969> that<00:02:56.500> anyways<00:02:57.500> as

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
move or in anything like that anyways as

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.629 
move or in anything like that anyways as
you<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.859> tell<00:02:58.069> there's<00:02:58.310> no<00:02:58.459> ventilation

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
you can tell there's no ventilation

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.229 
you can tell there's no ventilation
holes<00:02:59.299> in<00:02:59.480> this<00:03:00.010> because<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.699> know<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.000> hard

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
holes in this because you know the hard

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.849 
holes in this because you know the hard
drive<00:03:02.419> inside<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.019> is<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.469> western

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
drive inside of this is the western

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.330 
drive inside of this is the western
digital<00:03:04.010> green<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:06.680> that's<00:03:07.159> in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
digital green and it you know that's in

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.789 
digital green and it you know that's in
a<00:03:07.370> name<00:03:07.609> it's<00:03:07.879> green<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.449> it<00:03:09.169> uses<00:03:09.439> less<00:03:09.590> power

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
a name it's green it it uses less power

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.610 
a name it's green it it uses less power
and<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.730> runs<00:03:10.909> cool<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.569> this<00:03:12.139> thing<00:03:12.319> runs<00:03:12.500> at

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
and it runs cool so this thing runs at

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.179 
and it runs cool so this thing runs at
5400<00:03:13.370> rpm<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.870> runs<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.290> little<00:03:15.319> slower<00:03:15.919> than

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
5400 rpm so it runs a little slower than

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.770 
5400 rpm so it runs a little slower than
you<00:03:16.400> know<00:03:16.519> your<00:03:16.759> typical<00:03:17.090> hard<00:03:17.359> drive<00:03:17.569> your

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
you know your typical hard drive your

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.219 
you know your typical hard drive your
typical<00:03:18.079> hard<00:03:18.349> drive<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:19.359> 7200<00:03:20.359> rpm<00:03:20.750> you

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
typical hard drive is a 7200 rpm you

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.309 
typical hard drive is a 7200 rpm you
know<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:22.129> faster<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:23.239> hard<00:03:23.750> drive<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:23.930> rated

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
know the faster the hard drive is rated

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.199 
know the faster the hard drive is rated
it<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:25.069> more<00:03:25.280> performance<00:03:25.849> you're<00:03:26.000> going<00:03:26.150> to

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
it the more performance you're going to

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.689 
it the more performance you're going to
get<00:03:26.329> but<00:03:26.599> at<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> same<00:03:27.859> time<00:03:28.099> it<00:03:28.340> gets<00:03:28.519> hotter

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
get but at the same time it gets hotter

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.869 
get but at the same time it gets hotter
so<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:30.049> one<00:03:30.259> is<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.439> 54<00:03:30.919> RPM<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.699> know<00:03:31.790> they

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
so this one is the 54 RPM you know they

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.839 
so this one is the 54 RPM you know they
run<00:03:32.060> slower<00:03:32.389> but<00:03:32.659> it<00:03:32.810> runs<00:03:32.989> cooler<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.849> you

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
run slower but it runs cooler and you

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.249 
run slower but it runs cooler and you
know<00:03:34.939> the<00:03:35.090> cooler<00:03:35.299> your<00:03:35.509> hard<00:03:35.689> drive<00:03:35.870> runs<00:03:36.079> the

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:36.259 
know the cooler your hard drive runs the

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.649 
know the cooler your hard drive runs the
longer<00:03:36.560> life<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.889> going<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.129> have<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.239> that's

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
longer life is going to have so that's

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.420 
longer life is going to have so that's
definitely<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.139> plus<00:03:39.259> you<00:03:39.859> know<00:03:39.979> it's<00:03:40.159> quiet

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
definitely a plus you know it's quiet

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.439 
definitely a plus you know it's quiet
and<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.209> runs<00:03:41.389> cool<00:03:41.689> and<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:43.400> know<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:44.329> very

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
and it runs cool and you know it's very

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.990 
and it runs cool and you know it's very
good<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:46.129> second<00:03:46.430> thing<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.639> want<00:03:46.759> to<00:03:46.849> talk

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
good the second thing I want to talk

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.199 
good the second thing I want to talk
about<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.870> performance<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.739> know<00:03:49.209> first

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
about is the performance you know first

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.479 
about is the performance you know first
of<00:03:50.329> all<00:03:50.419> you<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:51.109> hard<00:03:51.470> drive<00:03:51.650> runs<00:03:52.009> off<00:03:52.459> the

thought<00:04:05.930> ends<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.430> USB<00:04:07.430> connector<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.689> know

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
thought ends a USB connector you know

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.890 
thought ends a USB connector you know
it's<00:04:09.680> USB<00:04:09.979> 2.0<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:11.209> it's<00:04:12.079> not<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.799> fastest

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
it's USB 2.0 it's it's not the fastest

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.699 
it's USB 2.0 it's it's not the fastest

obviously<00:04:20.810> but<00:04:21.500> i<00:04:21.709> did<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.070> benchmark<00:04:23.000> on<00:04:23.120> this

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
obviously but i did a benchmark on this

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.450 
obviously but i did a benchmark on this

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
tune and that's a hard drive but that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.790 
tune and that's a hard drive but that
it's<00:04:26.979> not<00:04:27.069> okay<00:04:27.639> it's<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:28.090> program<00:04:28.800> windows

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
it's not okay it's a program windows

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.740 
it's not okay it's a program windows
that<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.280> can<00:04:30.639> benchmark<00:04:31.090> your<00:04:31.389> hard<00:04:31.539> drive

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
that you can benchmark your hard drive

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.960 
that you can benchmark your hard drive
with<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.650> can<00:04:32.800> benchmark<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.550> transfer

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
with you can benchmark the transfer

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.830 
with you can benchmark the transfer

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
rates things like that and what I put I

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.719 
rates things like that and what I put I
got<00:04:38.229> for<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.470> transfer<00:04:38.770> rate<00:04:39.039> of<00:04:39.220> an<00:04:39.310> average

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
got for a transfer rate of an average

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.640 
got for a transfer rate of an average
Joe<00:04:40.349> 26.5<00:04:41.349> megabytes<00:04:42.039> a<00:04:42.240> second<00:04:43.289> which<00:04:44.289> is<00:04:44.319> you

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
Joe 26.5 megabytes a second which is you

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.279 
Joe 26.5 megabytes a second which is you
know<00:04:44.680> not<00:04:44.949> bad<00:04:45.449> but<00:04:46.449> same<00:04:46.660> time<00:04:46.870> isn't<00:04:47.050> that

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
know not bad but same time isn't that

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.089 
know not bad but same time isn't that
good<00:04:48.069> so<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:49.000> mean<00:04:49.599> it's<00:04:49.870> acceptable<00:04:50.380> for<00:04:50.830> you

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
good so I mean it's acceptable for you

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.610 
good so I mean it's acceptable for you
know<00:04:51.400> but<00:04:52.150> storage<00:04:52.509> drive<00:04:52.930> but<00:04:53.199> if<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:53.500> look

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
know but storage drive but if you look

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.020 
know but storage drive but if you look
at<00:04:53.770> performance<00:04:53.889> this<00:04:54.639> is<00:04:54.789> not<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.270> obviously

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
at performance this is not it obviously

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.860 
at performance this is not it obviously
and<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.330> know<00:04:58.479> it's<00:04:59.410> simple<00:04:59.770> plug-and-play

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and you know it's simple plug-and-play

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.749 
and you know it's simple plug-and-play
put<00:05:01.870> in<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.199> very<00:05:03.009> simple<00:05:03.370> interface<00:05:03.669> you

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
put in the very simple interface you

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.900 
put in the very simple interface you
just<00:05:03.940> plug<00:05:04.120> in<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.360> power<00:05:04.509> brick<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.759> plug<00:05:06.759> in

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
just plug in the power brick and plug in

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.850 
just plug in the power brick and plug in
the<00:05:07.000> USB<00:05:07.030> connected<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.080> your<00:05:08.199> computer<00:05:08.349> and

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
the USB connected to your computer and

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.700 
the USB connected to your computer and
it<00:05:09.099> works<00:05:09.509> instant<00:05:10.509> storage<00:05:10.720> not<00:05:11.320> really<00:05:11.590> much

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
it works instant storage not really much

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.939 
it works instant storage not really much
to<00:05:12.099> say<00:05:12.340> about<00:05:12.699> it<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.990> know<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.380> like<00:05:14.770> that
