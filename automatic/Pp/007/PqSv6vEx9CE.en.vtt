00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.910
 but I also know it actually 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.140
 half of the matches of the uci world tour 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.580
 was in his own house 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.019
 at 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.289
 last week that the municipality is this boy 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.289
 this can be a beautiful church and striking 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.869
 or expected in Africa within a short time 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.030
 and after and now it's up to me to show me that year 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.960
 and that something has an object 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.899
 so that simple is that every referee from to marco 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.810
 also has no side 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.070
 I say yes really 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.070
 was able to maintain the competition 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.940
 and you're just locking up the next one 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.089
 the first 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.260
 the netherlands is about to say the dividend is about 39 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.100
 further announced to finish is sat but yes I do a little later she will 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.000
 deliver 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.200
 so that I surprise people africa 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.510
 so a very simple in this tournament, I also showed it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.530
 and 30th you are going to show 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.820
 it's a disaster 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.290
 I was a bit more simple 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.500
 so it's not grabbing points it's a resuscitation child 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.250
 and I don't know exactly how we know that against a book anywhere else 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.600
 no of course not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.069
 so you can also say that I do not say this but we still have to give a salary 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.110
 for the first time it was 70 kilos per couple that is the robbery 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.090
 the houseboats boston strong market 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 van der kroef would exist for me it was for victory 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 because I am against a topper 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.860
 received in a chaos 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.990
 and can participate very well 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.220
 now I am experienced anyway 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.410
 and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.200
 yes the hall center will become the existing one in the party 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.670
 it goes immediately 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.860
 you must now make it back again before the forgotten party 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.630
 not so much the title 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.159
 the capital Islamabad goodness in morocco or broken through it all 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.640
 years because it was a window for the first time 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.050
 know how for the following distances 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.880
 It is so that I was definitely on the program 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.179
 Now just scare away again 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.219
 the latter cannot be decided by your team 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.179
 yes you name it 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.179
 Jenneke van Pipes School is better under control 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:17.450
 the medicines 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.149
 to ride in the stores 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.430
 I'm also on Twitter I don't have those packages 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.219
 it is mainly the mast in a direct way 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.439
 it is waiting 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.509
 Expected I will have a tasty tip of the veil 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.169
 he has to work 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:33.689
 shell had to effect 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.299
 heemstede I am going to please 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.739
 from groningen 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.889
 look dutch airport 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.779
 forster is fit on time more often 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.509
 do you understand your own pocket that they say strike 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.059
 say it's the first time 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.079
 mickey managed to reach an agreement 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.109
 it's possible 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.309
 very simple 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.079
 but believe me i'm going really easy 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.659
 kokoity growth of china 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.649
 cdja party 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.999
 we are already working 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.999
 yes those elderly but I am a boy 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.099
 November 30 turned out to be a car 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.499
 I look forward to being on the straight that 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.529
 and thanks to the large role may remain thirtieth for the time being 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.409
 then I didn't get involved in their fifth yellow card 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.849
 media in the dunes 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.919
 the zaanse i'm concentrating again 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.479
 I also had the name for parties other times a day 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.509
 however, he wished it to be worthless 39 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.859
 also the long wait how to pick up the thread again later to the gala that you 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.980
 on a party policy to sleep the markets 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.210
 through the cockpit 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.339
 I'm not on time anyway 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.329
 anyway comes a little later 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.129
 I always have a duvet with me 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.239
 also march but like that 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.899
 the number of missing 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.819
 and yes and no last to start and the hague the last round 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.549
 the current that guy and am not so concerned about the recovery 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.039
 is known for being from 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.329
 so it's not real 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.450
 hard to tell any broadcaster in the long run 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.109
 because you have enough 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.980
 I am working now, I still have to place the right moment 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.919
 that's what it's about 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.639
 in advance on an offer 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.180
 there can just ratify it later it is a certain group fully adequate 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.479
 moment 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.680
 I certainly managed to get started in the spring around you in the net 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 kees van helden 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.479
 the ship has been seated
