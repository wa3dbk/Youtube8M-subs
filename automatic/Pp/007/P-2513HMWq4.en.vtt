00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.000 
row it gobbles up a lot of table space
and<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.870> can<00:04:16.079> be<00:04:16.109> kind<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.470> tricky<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.890> you

played with the cardboard and son were a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.490 
played with the cardboard and son were a
little<00:04:46.670> bit<00:04:46.940> at<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.720> end<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.110> generator

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
little bit at the end of a generator

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.660 
little bit at the end of a generator
feisty<00:04:48.800> at<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.920> beginning<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.190> generation

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
feisty at the beginning of generation

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.310 
feisty at the beginning of generation
everybody<00:04:50.030> draws<00:04:50.330> randomly<00:04:50.870> one<00:04:51.110> of<00:04:51.200> those

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
everybody draws randomly one of those

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.500 
everybody draws randomly one of those
free<00:04:51.590> actions<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.480> know

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
free actions and that is you know

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.120 
free actions and that is you know
there's<00:04:53.870> already<00:04:54.080> cards<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:54.740> course<00:04:54.950> there's

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
there's already cards of course there's

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.110 
there's already cards of course there's
a<00:04:55.190> random<00:04:55.490> element<00:04:55.610> that's<00:04:55.820> just<00:04:55.970> gonna<00:04:56.060> be

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
a random element that's just gonna be

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.450 
a random element that's just gonna be
the<00:04:56.300> case<00:04:56.540> but<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.500> free<00:04:57.830> action<00:04:58.010> maybe

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
the case but that free action maybe

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.890 
the case but that free action maybe
because<00:04:58.790> some<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.090> those<00:04:59.240> free<00:04:59.480> actions<00:04:59.780> are

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
because some of those free actions are

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.450 
because some of those free actions are
better<00:05:00.020> than<00:05:00.230> others<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:01.040> maybe<00:05:01.220> that's<00:05:01.430> a

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
better than others and maybe that's a

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.590 
better than others and maybe that's a
little<00:05:01.490> bit<00:05:01.700> too<00:05:01.820> much<00:05:01.940> randoms<00:05:02.330> for<00:05:02.480> some

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
little bit too much randoms for some

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.290 
little bit too much randoms for some
people<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:02.900> it's<00:05:03.050> still<00:05:03.200> it's<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.500> very<00:05:03.770> minor

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
people but it's still it's a very minor

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.700 
people but it's still it's a very minor
complaint<00:05:05.300> doesn't<00:05:06.020> bother<00:05:06.170> me<00:05:06.290> at<00:05:06.440> all<00:05:06.530> but

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
complaint doesn't bother me at all but

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.860 
complaint doesn't bother me at all but
maybe<00:05:06.860> would<00:05:06.980> bother<00:05:07.100> some<00:05:07.370> people<00:05:07.400> and

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
maybe would bother some people and

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
maybe would bother some people and
really<00:05:08.870> for<00:05:09.110> me<00:05:09.230> and<00:05:09.350> Jen<00:05:09.530> playing<00:05:09.830> a

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
really for me and Jen playing a

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
really for me and Jen playing a
two-player<00:05:10.190> game<00:05:10.340> I<00:05:10.370> don't<00:05:10.580> think<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.790> table

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
two-player game I don't think the table

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.040 
two-player game I don't think the table
space<00:05:11.120> is<00:05:11.210> gonna<00:05:11.300> be<00:05:11.420> an<00:05:11.480> issue<00:05:11.540> too<00:05:11.750> but<00:05:11.900> bear

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
space is gonna be an issue too but bear

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.930 
space is gonna be an issue too but bear
that<00:05:12.230> in<00:05:12.320> mind<00:05:12.350> actually<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:13.220> did<00:05:13.370> mention<00:05:13.730> it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
that in mind actually I did mention it

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.600 
that in mind actually I did mention it

to him a suit and he did say that is
something<00:05:16.820> they're<00:05:17.000> aware<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.270> as<00:05:17.510> well<00:05:17.750> and

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
something they're aware of as well and

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.090 
something they're aware of as well and
you<00:05:18.350> know<00:05:18.410> they're<00:05:18.560> trying<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.860> figure<00:05:19.070> out

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
you know they're trying to figure out

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.200 
you know they're trying to figure out
there's<00:05:19.310> something<00:05:19.520> they<00:05:19.580> can<00:05:19.730> they<00:05:19.940> can<00:05:19.970> help

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
themselves are the small you know

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.460 
themselves are the small you know
agricola<00:05:23.180> size<00:05:23.360> card<00:05:23.660> so<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.840> helps<00:05:24.260> quite<00:05:24.440> a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
bit but anyway it's such a minor

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.170 
bit but anyway it's such a minor
complaint<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.980> really<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.550> should<00:05:28.820> not<00:05:28.970> let

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
complaint and really you should not let

mistakes this time I'm going to blame
the<00:06:03.350> rules<00:06:03.500> because<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:03.770> didn't<00:06:04.010> have<00:06:04.100> the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
the rules because I didn't have the

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.220 
the rules because I didn't have the
final<00:06:04.610> copy<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:05.180> there<00:06:05.810> were<00:06:05.870> maybe<00:06:05.990> some

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
final copy and there were maybe some

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.080 
final copy and there were maybe some
mistakes<00:06:06.500> but<00:06:06.680> still<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.730> should<00:06:07.940> have<00:06:08.060> a

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
mistakes but still you should have a

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.090 
mistakes but still you should have a
very<00:06:08.390> good<00:06:08.540> idea<00:06:08.660> of<00:06:09.080> what<00:06:09.620> makes<00:06:09.800> this<00:06:09.919> game

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
very good idea of what makes this game
