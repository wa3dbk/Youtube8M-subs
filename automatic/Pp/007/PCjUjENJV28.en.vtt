seconds you can go through i grow like
this<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.909> can<00:01:29.060> obviously<00:01:29.149> go<00:01:29.509> down<00:01:29.780> if<00:01:30.380> it's

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
this you can obviously go down if it's

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.789 
this you can obviously go down if it's
deep<00:01:31.159> enough<00:01:31.719> but<00:01:32.719> it<00:01:32.840> has<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.140> find<00:01:33.380> that

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
deep enough but it has to find that

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.059 
deep enough but it has to find that
cable<00:01:34.719> another<00:01:35.719> bit<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.109> air<00:01:36.380> before<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:36.920> can

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
cable another bit of air before we can

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.390 
cable another bit of air before we can
do<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:38.630> get<00:01:38.749> straight<00:01:38.990> down

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.130 

oops<00:01:42.400> let's<00:01:43.000> see<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.920> back<00:01:45.040> up<00:01:46.140> that's

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
oops let's see that don't back up that's

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.320 
oops let's see that don't back up that's
a<00:01:47.260> jump<00:01:47.650> fast<00:01:47.920> enough<00:01:48.690> there<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.750> go<00:01:51.330> so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
a jump fast enough there you go so

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.960 
a jump fast enough there you go so
that's<00:01:52.510> how<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.780> works<00:01:52.990> simply<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.820> also

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
that's how it works simply I can also

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.630 
that's how it works simply I can also
create<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.780> book<00:01:55.990> yourself<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:57.159> help<00:01:57.369> set

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
create the book yourself and to help set

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.890 
create the book yourself and to help set
the<00:01:57.670> title<00:01:57.940> as<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:59.710> book<00:02:00.100> title<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.700> the

the title as a book title in the
configuration<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.340> can<00:02:03.490> also<00:02:03.580> change<00:02:03.790> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
configuration you can also change the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.310 
configuration you can also change the
default<00:02:04.270> page<00:02:04.540> text<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:05.020> well<00:02:05.050> in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
default page text as well in

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.389 
default page text as well in
configuration<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.900> other<00:02:08.050> commands<00:02:08.500> are<00:02:08.740> pH

configuration to other commands are pH

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.320 
configuration to other commands are pH
info<00:02:10.890> cells<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.070> any<00:02:12.280> talents<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.300> have
