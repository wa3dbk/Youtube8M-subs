when<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.440> start<00:00:10.740> working<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.130> speedlights

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
when you start working with speedlights

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.120 
when you start working with speedlights
it's<00:00:12.120> great<00:00:12.480> working<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.019> TTL<00:00:13.530> mode<00:00:13.769> because

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
it's great working in TTL mode because

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.160 
it's great working in TTL mode because
you<00:00:14.219> remove<00:00:14.670> having<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> worry<00:00:15.540> about<00:00:15.870> what

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you remove having to worry about what

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.680 
you remove having to worry about what
that<00:00:16.199> exposure<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.039> doing<00:00:17.430> however<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.270> shoot

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
that exposure is doing however I shoot

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.380 
that exposure is doing however I shoot
with<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> camera<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.470> manual<00:00:19.740> mode<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.029> can

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
with the camera in manual mode so I can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450 
with the camera in manual mode so I can
make<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> creative<00:00:22.170> decision<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
make the creative decision of what I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.000 
make the creative decision of what I
want<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> ambient<00:00:24.539> exposure<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.830> can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
want the ambient exposure to be you can

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380 
want the ambient exposure to be you can
shoot<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.400> aperture<00:00:26.670> priority<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.359> shutter

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
shoot an aperture priority or shutter

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.870 
shoot an aperture priority or shutter
priority<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.590> keep<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.949> mind<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> camera<00:00:29.609> is

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
priority but keep in mind the camera is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.279 
priority but keep in mind the camera is
going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> make<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> lot<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> adjustments<00:00:30.660> for

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289

about anybody look great with this kind
of<00:00:46.950> light<00:00:47.100> source<00:00:47.840> I'm<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> quick

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of light source I'm going to do a quick

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.799 
of light source I'm going to do a quick
ambient<00:00:50.010> exposure<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.629> what's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
ambient exposure here just see what's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
ambient exposure here just see what's
happening<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> graphics<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> our

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
happening kind of the graphics of our

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.540 
happening kind of the graphics of our
shot<00:00:53.820> you'll<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.660> able<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.379> we

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
shot you'll be able to see that if we

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
shot you'll be able to see that if we
properly<00:00:56.550> expose<00:00:57.090> four<00:00:57.510> key<00:00:57.719> from<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
properly expose four key from the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
properly expose four key from the
foreground<00:00:58.440> we're<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.609> exposing

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
foreground we're actually over exposing

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
foreground we're actually over exposing
quite<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.050> from<00:01:01.260> our<00:01:01.379> meter<00:01:01.649> reading<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
quite a bit from our meter reading and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820 
quite a bit from our meter reading and
you'll<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> sky<00:01:03.600> gets<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.559> washed

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you'll see the sky gets really washed

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.460 
you'll see the sky gets really washed
out<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.720> exciting

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
out and it's not a very exciting

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.670 
out and it's not a very exciting
photograph<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
photograph so what I like to do is I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.960 
photograph so what I like to do is I
look<00:01:11.610> through<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> camera<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> based<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.260> my

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
look through the camera and based on my

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
look through the camera and based on my
reflective<00:01:14.970> light<00:01:15.180> meter<00:01:15.450> reading<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.840> camera

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
reflective light meter reading in camera

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.490 
reflective light meter reading in camera
I<00:01:16.580> underexposed<00:01:17.580> by<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> stop<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:19.439> I'm

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
I underexposed by about a stop so I'm

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.929 
I underexposed by about a stop so I'm
going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> take<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> look<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.369> exposure

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
going to take a look at that exposure

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
going to take a look at that exposure

blown out we lost all the drama so what
I<00:03:04.500> did<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.769> actually<00:03:04.970> underexposed<00:03:05.970> from<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
I did is actually underexposed from the

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.660 
I did is actually underexposed from the
ambient<00:03:06.570> by<00:03:06.810> about<00:03:06.989> two<00:03:07.350> stops<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.070> then

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
ambient by about two stops and then

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.699 
ambient by about two stops and then
brought<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.090> softbox<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.200> big<00:03:10.470> main

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
brought the softbox in for a big main

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.349 
brought the softbox in for a big main
light<00:03:10.980> between<00:03:11.430> those<00:03:11.790> two<00:03:11.970> things<00:03:12.150> you're

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
light between those two things you're

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.390 
light between those two things you're
creating<00:03:12.780> an<00:03:12.870> image<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.980> human<00:03:14.310> eye

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
creating an image that the human eye

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.880 
creating an image that the human eye
can't<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.269> deep<00:03:15.870> blue<00:03:16.260> sky<00:03:16.470> with

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
can't see you have a deep blue sky with

can't see you have a deep blue sky with
a<00:03:16.920> underexposed<00:03:17.760> ambient<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.359> then<00:03:18.870> you're

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
a underexposed ambient and then you're

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.259 
a underexposed ambient and then you're
over<00:03:19.590> exposing<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.250> flash<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:20.940> slightly

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
over exposing that flash just slightly

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.509 
over exposing that flash just slightly
to<00:03:21.510> create<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.959> beautiful<00:03:22.650> dramatic<00:03:22.829> light<00:03:23.340> on

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to create a beautiful dramatic light on

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.110 
to create a beautiful dramatic light on
the<00:03:23.609> subject

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
the subject

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.610 
the subject
and<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.600> end<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.930> with<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.109> really<00:03:25.500> interesting

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and you end up with a really interesting

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.280 
and you end up with a really interesting
portrait
