with some friends

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
with some friends
you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.580> once<00:01:20.850> twice<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> week<00:01:21.480> about<00:01:22.260> six

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.520 
there and why my style seemed to be
working<00:01:43.620> which<00:01:44.580> was<00:01:45.110> pretend<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.260> really

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
working which was pretend I'm really

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.470 
working which was pretend I'm really
passive<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.610> freakishly

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
passive and then just be freakishly

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.540 
passive and then just be freakishly
aggressive<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.410> like<00:01:49.530> three<00:01:49.830> hands<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.400> then

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
aggressive for like three hands and then

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.830 
aggressive for like three hands and then
go<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.940> being<00:01:51.090> passive<00:01:51.390> again<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.690> kind

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
go back to being passive again it kind

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.570 
go back to being passive again it kind
of<00:01:51.870> worked<00:01:52.080> so<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.590> could<00:01:53.280> I've<00:01:53.370> done

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
of worked so I just could I've done

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.330 
of worked so I just could I've done
anything<00:01:53.730> better<00:01:53.970> well<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:55.230> from<00:01:55.350> win<00:01:55.560> yeah

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
anything better well a lot from win yeah

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.380 
anything better well a lot from win yeah
you<00:01:56.520> could<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> something<00:01:56.970> better<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.300> next

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you could do something better the next

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
you could do something better the next
time<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.310> couldn't<00:01:59.580> have<00:01:59.700> come

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
time I think like you couldn't have come

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.100 
time I think like you couldn't have come
into<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.390> done<00:02:00.480> better<00:02:00.660> than<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:00.960> did

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
into this and done better than you did

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.870 
into this and done better than you did
like<00:02:01.680> given<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.220> experience<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.760> had

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
like given the experience that you had

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.100 
like given the experience that you had
before<00:02:03.000> yeah<00:02:03.720> that's<00:02:03.900> true

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
before yeah that's true

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
before yeah that's true
they<00:02:04.290> say<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.160> lot<00:02:05.280> harder<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.820> read

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
they say is it's a lot harder to read

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.999 
they say is it's a lot harder to read
beginners<00:02:06.750> because<00:02:07.410> they're<00:02:07.590> very<00:02:07.740> like

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
beginners because they're very like

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
beginners because they're very like
unpredictable<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> think<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.929> had

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
unpredictable so I like to think I had

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
unpredictable so I like to think I had
that<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.590> well<00:02:10.769> to<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.039> advantage<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:11.879> did

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that as well to my advantage what did

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.309 
that as well to my advantage what did
you<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> players<00:02:12.780> at<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> table
