of paper co to be a little bit of that's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.119 
of paper co to be a little bit of that's
the<00:00:56.100> mechanism<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.739> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> looks

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the mechanism and this is how it looks

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.299 
the mechanism and this is how it looks
once<00:01:00.120> done<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.100> bit

the<00:01:05.700> paper<00:01:05.939> might<00:01:06.240> end<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:07.070> breaking<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.030> be

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the paper might end up breaking so be

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.109 
the paper might end up breaking so be
little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.320> delicate<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
little bit delicate and once you make it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
little bit delicate and once you make it
and<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:15.030> wind<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.320> figure

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and you can actually wind up the figure

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.940 
and you can actually wind up the figure
and<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:19.770> will<00:01:19.979> start<00:01:20.610> moving<00:01:21.950> pretty

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and it will start moving pretty

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
and it will start moving pretty
impressive<00:01:23.549> right

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.600
