jumping<00:03:19.690> up<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:19.989> down<00:03:20.109> we'll<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.560> do<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
jumping up and down we'll just do it

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.949 
jumping up and down we'll just do it
like<00:03:20.859> this<00:03:20.889> so<00:03:21.280> we're<00:03:22.209> gonna<00:03:22.329> build<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.750> across

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
like this so we're gonna build it across

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.800 
like this so we're gonna build it across
I<00:03:23.200> may<00:03:23.410> put<00:03:23.590> some<00:03:23.799> extra<00:03:23.889> beams<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.810> dominat

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
I may put some extra beams in dominat

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.259 
I may put some extra beams in dominat
just<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.079> be<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> big<00:03:26.650> machine<00:03:26.859> red<00:03:27.190> wall<00:03:27.430> we'll

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
just to be a big machine red wall we'll

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.420 
just to be a big machine red wall we'll
put<00:03:28.480> some<00:03:28.629> extra<00:03:28.919> decoration<00:03:29.919> in<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.190> minute

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
put some extra decoration in a minute

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.640 
put some extra decoration in a minute
but<00:03:30.910> for<00:03:31.060> now<00:03:31.120> we'll<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:31.930> get<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.349> general

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
but for now we'll just get the general

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.909 
but for now we'll just get the general
gist<00:03:32.829> or<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.639> looks<00:03:33.790> like<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:35.530> hello

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
gist or what it looks like right hello

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.580 
gist or what it looks like right hello
so<00:03:36.280> as<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.730> can<00:03:36.849> tell<00:03:36.910> I've<00:03:37.359> gone<00:03:37.690> into<00:03:37.900> speed

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
so as you can tell I've gone into speed

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.250 
so as you can tell I've gone into speed
mode<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:39.040> have<00:03:39.129> sped<00:03:39.879> up<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.419> build<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.019> I'm

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
mode I have sped up the build and I'm

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.449 
mode I have sped up the build and I'm
going<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.410> be<00:03:41.500> talking<00:03:41.650> over<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.160> quickly

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
going to be talking over it quickly

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.490 
going to be talking over it quickly
basically<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.419> will<00:03:43.599> be<00:03:43.660> doing<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.989> lot<00:03:44.230> in

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
basically I will be doing this a lot in

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.170 
basically I will be doing this a lot in
this<00:03:44.799> survival<00:03:45.250> series<00:03:45.489> because<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:45.910> kind<00:03:46.120> of

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
this survival series because I kind of

this survival series because I kind of
want<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.389> build<00:03:46.599> some<00:03:46.810> cool<00:03:46.989> things<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:48.190> lot<00:03:48.699> the

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
want to build some cool things a lot the

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.729 
want to build some cool things a lot the
projects<00:03:49.870> are<00:03:49.989> quite<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.139> mines<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.620> they<00:03:50.680> do

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
projects are quite a mines and they do

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.009 
projects are quite a mines and they do
take<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> long<00:03:51.459> time<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.970> forgot<00:03:52.299> how<00:03:52.569> long<00:03:52.870> it

take a long time I forgot how long it

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.869 
take a long time I forgot how long it
takes<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.440> build<00:03:53.560> something<00:03:53.889> when<00:03:54.730> you

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
takes to build something when you

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.210 
takes to build something when you
haven't<00:03:55.060> got<00:03:55.209> creative<00:03:55.690> mode<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.590> spend

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
haven't got creative mode on I spend

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.000 
haven't got creative mode on I spend
months<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.269> months<00:03:58.359> building<00:03:59.109> things<00:03:59.349> on<00:03:59.590> you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
months and months building things on you

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.500 
months and months building things on you
know<00:04:00.160> before<00:04:00.459> we<00:04:00.549> had<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.760> updates<00:04:01.060> creative

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
know before we had the updates creative

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.860 
know before we had the updates creative

and<00:04:06.819> just<00:04:06.970> building<00:04:07.389> scaffolding<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.410> get<00:04:08.560> up

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
and just building scaffolding to get up

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.440 
and just building scaffolding to get up
because<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.430> kept<00:04:09.609> falling<00:04:09.790> down

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
because I kept falling down

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.110 
because I kept falling down

we'll get to the finished article more
or<00:04:17.200> less<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:18.400> here<00:04:18.669> I'm<00:04:18.820> scripting<00:04:19.329> some<00:04:19.510> more

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
or less and here I'm scripting some more

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.750 
or less and here I'm scripting some more
wall<00:04:20.040> that's<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.190> other<00:04:21.250> thing<00:04:21.400> if<00:04:21.669> you're

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
wall that's the other thing if you're

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.000 
wall that's the other thing if you're
gonna<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.090> build<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.020> make<00:04:23.650> sure<00:04:23.680> you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
gonna do a build like this make sure you

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.590 
gonna do a build like this make sure you
have<00:04:24.100> more<00:04:24.370> than<00:04:24.430> enough<00:04:24.610> materials

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
have more than enough materials

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.659 
have more than enough materials
I<00:04:25.630> found<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.560> kept<00:04:26.889> running<00:04:27.100> out<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.490> wood

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
I found that I kept running out of wood

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.490 
I found that I kept running out of wood
and<00:04:27.910> running<00:04:28.450> out<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.570> wall<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.139> that's<00:04:29.290> all

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
and running out a wall and that's all

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.980 
and running out a wall and that's all
off<00:04:29.620> camera<00:04:30.010> or<00:04:30.190> go<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.550> get<00:04:30.729> some<00:04:30.970> wall<00:04:31.660> and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
off camera or go and get some wall and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.930 
off camera or go and get some wall and
wood<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.620> just<00:04:32.800> kind<00:04:33.040> of<00:04:33.130> disrupted<00:04:33.760> my

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
wood and it just kind of disrupted my

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.090 
wood and it just kind of disrupted my
video<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:35.229> doesn't<00:04:35.470> really<00:04:35.560> matter<00:04:35.770> see

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
video so it doesn't really matter see

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.620 
video so it doesn't really matter see
from<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.370> were<00:04:36.430> called<00:04:36.669> in<00:04:36.850> but<00:04:37.090> if<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.419> want

Mateusz to do job so as you can see it's

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.530 
Mateusz to do job so as you can see it's
taking<00:04:44.410> shape<00:04:44.440> nicely<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.430> red<00:04:45.970> barn<00:04:46.270> is

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
taking shape nicely the red barn is

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.360 
taking shape nicely the red barn is
coming<00:04:47.200> along<00:04:47.410> we've<00:04:47.680> got<00:04:47.830> some<00:04:48.040> of<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.190> beams

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
coming along we've got some of the beams

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.969 
coming along we've got some of the beams
at<00:04:48.639> entranceways<00:04:49.300> both<00:04:50.200> sides<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.770> bit

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
at entranceways both sides of the bit

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.530 
at entranceways both sides of the bit
barn<00:04:51.220> now<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.669> then<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:52.000> outside<00:04:52.389> you<00:04:52.510> can

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
barn now and then the outside you can
