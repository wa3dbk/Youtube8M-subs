00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
piece of construction paper fold it in

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.970 
piece of construction paper fold it in
half<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.029> way<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.590> then<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.890> to

and<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.130> want<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> edge<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.210> fold<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.769> so

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and you want the edge to fold up so

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.099 
and you want the edge to fold up so
you're<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> draw<00:00:29.929> from<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you're just going to draw from this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.780 
you're just going to draw from this
corner<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:33.620> curve<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.770> around<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:35.550> two

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
corner and curve it around about two

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.100 
corner and curve it around about two
here<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:36.450> come<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> end<00:00:42.930> up

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
here and then come down so you end up

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.040 
here and then come down so you end up
like<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.329> cut<00:00:45.840> off<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
like this and then you just cut off the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.119 
like this and then you just cut off the
edge<00:00:47.329> fold<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:51.649> then<00:00:52.649> bring<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.010> around

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
edge fold it up and then bring it around

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
edge fold it up and then bring it around
and<00:00:53.489> back<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:55.699> make<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.730> fit<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> head<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and back and make it fit the head you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.580 
and back and make it fit the head you
can<00:00:57.780> make<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.289> larger<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.550> smaller<00:01:00.469> bring<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
can make it larger or smaller bring the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.899 
can make it larger or smaller bring the
points<00:01:01.920> together<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> have

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
points together and back and you have

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.590 
points together and back and you have
your<00:01:08.939> basic<00:01:09.360> hat<00:01:10.700> once<00:01:11.700> you've<00:01:11.909> done<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
can leave this pointed you can push it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.390 
can leave this pointed you can push it
in<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.360> fold<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.130> create

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
in and fold it down you can create

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.550 
in and fold it down you can create
different<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.240> different<00:01:18.270> look<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.350> your

Robin Hood hat I made this feather out
of<00:01:23.100> construction<00:01:23.340> paper<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> basically<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of construction paper and basically I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.569 
of construction paper and basically I
just<00:01:26.100> took<00:01:26.280> two<00:01:26.490> pieces<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.000> paper<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:34.579> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
just took two pieces of paper I have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.649 
just took two pieces of paper I have
four<00:01:35.970> pieces<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.689> together<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.299> cut

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
four pieces all together and I just cut

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
four pieces all together and I just cut
out<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> feather<00:01:40.140> shape<00:01:40.470> making<00:01:41.250> sure<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
out a feather shape making sure that I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.149 
out a feather shape making sure that I
kept<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:43.110> folded<00:01:43.590> edge<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> had<00:01:46.799> my

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
kept the folded edge in so that I had my

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.660 
kept the folded edge in so that I had my
stem<00:01:48.979> cut<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> feather

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
stem cut it like this at out a feather

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.469 
stem cut it like this at out a feather
shape

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.260 

and<00:01:59.479> then<00:01:59.900> just<00:02:00.140> cut<00:02:00.380> slits<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.970> don't<00:02:02.150> want

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and then just cut slits you don't want

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.700 
and then just cut slits you don't want
to<00:02:02.330> get<00:02:02.450> too<00:02:02.630> close<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.200> stem<00:02:03.470> because

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
to get too close to the stem because

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.580 
to get too close to the stem because
then<00:02:04.070> your<00:02:04.250> feather<00:02:04.520> will<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:04.939> weak<00:02:05.590> once

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
then your feather will be weak once

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.440 
then your feather will be weak once
you've<00:02:06.770> cut<00:02:07.070> slits<00:02:07.430> all<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.000> way<00:02:08.149> through

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you've cut slits all the way through

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.809 
you've cut slits all the way through
what<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.590> want<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.860> do<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.160> lay<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.399> bead<00:02:10.670> of

what you want to do is lay a bead of

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.290 
what you want to do is lay a bead of
glue<00:02:10.870> on<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.610> inside<00:02:13.690> here<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:17.180> will

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
glue on the inside here and that will

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.199 
glue on the inside here and that will
give<00:02:17.450> your<00:02:17.569> feathers<00:02:18.050> strength<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.970> lay<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
bead of glue down the middle making sure

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.160 
bead of glue down the middle making sure
that<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.970> don't<00:02:23.150> get<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.840> sides

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that you don't get it on the sides

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.720 
that you don't get it on the sides
because<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:24.830> want<00:02:25.010> your<00:02:25.130> feathers<00:02:25.519> to
