00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:24.130 
I have begun to fear and we never hold
my<00:03:15.060> beloved<00:03:15.540> elder<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:15.990> my<00:03:16.110> arms<00:03:16.380> again

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.190 

the<00:03:25.140> problem<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.860> create<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.330> political

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the problem you create is a political

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.860 
the problem you create is a political
one

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.929 

yesterday<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:32.109> believe<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.280> would<00:03:33.489> never<00:03:33.700> have

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
yesterday I believe I would never have

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.330 
yesterday I believe I would never have
done<00:03:34.120> what<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.840> did<00:03:34.959> today<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:37.409> feel<00:03:38.409> like

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
done what I did today I feel like

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.890 
done what I did today I feel like
something<00:03:39.879> important<00:03:40.719> has<00:03:41.620> happened<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:42.579> me

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
something important has happened to me

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.320 
something important has happened to me
is<00:03:44.349> this<00:03:44.650> possible

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
is this possible

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.250 
is this possible
I<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:47.020> met<00:03:47.530> her<00:03:47.710> and<00:03:48.310> yet<00:03:48.550> I<00:03:48.820> have<00:03:49.750> fallen<00:03:50.140> in

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
I just met her and yet I have fallen in

00:03:50.260 --> 00:04:03.070 
I just met her and yet I have fallen in
love<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:51.070> Luisa<00:03:51.610> Rey

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:15.370 

saving<00:04:04.070> me<00:04:04.160> twice<00:04:04.370> move<00:04:04.670> far<00:04:05.540> okay

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.650 

there's<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.650> natural<00:04:16.950> order<00:04:17.610> to<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.150> world

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
there's a natural order to this world

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.560 
there's a natural order to this world
and<00:04:19.320> those<00:04:19.530> who<00:04:19.590> try<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.220> upend<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.030> do<00:04:21.390> not

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
and those who try to upend it do not

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:55.570 
and those who try to upend it do not
fare<00:04:21.959> well

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.409 

I<00:04:58.100> believe<00:04:59.100> there<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.400> another<00:04:59.610> world<00:04:59.910> waiting

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
I believe there is another world waiting

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.580 
I believe there is another world waiting
for<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.630> six-month<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.500> better<00:05:02.400> world<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:04.470> I'll

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
for a six-month a better world and I'll

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:17.450 
for a six-month a better world and I'll
be<00:05:04.710> waiting<00:05:05.040> for<00:05:05.070> you<00:05:05.310> live

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.520 

you
