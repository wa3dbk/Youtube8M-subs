looking<00:00:04.350> at<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.680> designjet<00:00:05.220> 450<00:00:06.000> see<00:00:06.210> it's

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:06.920 
looking at the designjet 450 see it's

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.290 
looking at the designjet 450 see it's
reducing<00:00:07.920> jagged<00:00:08.370> lines<00:00:08.640> on<00:00:08.940> some<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.240> the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
reducing jagged lines on some of the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.669 
reducing jagged lines on some of the
colors<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:09.660> what<00:00:09.990> we're<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.230> do<00:00:10.410> is

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
colors so what we're going to do is

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.589 
colors so what we're going to do is
going<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.190> run<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.339> cartridge<00:00:11.759> alignment<00:00:12.330> color

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
going to run a cartridge alignment color

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.839 
going to run a cartridge alignment color
cartridge<00:00:13.049> alignment<00:00:13.500> page<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.730> we've

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
cartridge alignment page on it so we've

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.830 
cartridge alignment page on it so we've
got<00:00:14.999> our<00:00:15.089> a4<00:00:15.450> sheet<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.780> paper<00:00:15.929> there<00:00:16.200> and<00:00:17.840> got

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
got our a4 sheet of paper there and got

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.380

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
color cartridge alignment sheet so we've

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
color cartridge alignment sheet so we've
got<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.310> color<00:00:56.760> cartridge<00:00:57.180> alignment<00:00:57.600> sheet

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
got the color cartridge alignment sheet

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
got the color cartridge alignment sheet
that's<00:00:57.930> been<00:00:58.080> produced<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.670> useful<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that's been produced here useful in a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.170 
that's been produced here useful in a
couple<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.360> ways<00:01:01.460> shows<00:01:02.460> how<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.700> colors<00:01:03.090> are

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
couple of ways shows how the colors are

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.399 
couple of ways shows how the colors are
actually<00:01:03.300> printing<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.110> each<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
actually printing for each of the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
actually printing for each of the
individual<00:01:04.830> colors<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.079> they<00:01:07.079> will

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
individual colors there and they will

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.279 
individual colors there and they will
look<00:01:07.320> fairly<00:01:07.770> good<00:01:08.869> magentas<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> little

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
look fairly good magentas got a little

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.200 
look fairly good magentas got a little
bit<00:01:10.380> missing<00:01:10.770> blacks<00:01:11.520> got<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.789> couple<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
bit missing blacks got a couple of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
bit missing blacks got a couple of
couple<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.840> missing<00:01:13.140> bits<00:01:13.289> on<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.649> but<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
couple of missing bits on it but to be

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.209 
couple of missing bits on it but to be
honest<00:01:14.659> not<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.990> bad<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.469> this<00:01:16.560> design<00:01:16.890> jets

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
honest not not bad for this design jets

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.529 
honest not not bad for this design jets
certainly<00:01:17.939> wouldn't<00:01:18.179> be<00:01:18.210> looking<00:01:18.329> at

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
certainly wouldn't be looking at

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.169 
certainly wouldn't be looking at
replacing<00:01:18.719> any<00:01:19.109> cartridges<00:01:19.820> we<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:20.939> come

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
replacing any cartridges we then come

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.919 
replacing any cartridges we then come
down<00:01:21.710> look<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.829> this<00:01:22.979> section<00:01:23.249> here<00:01:23.640> and

down look in this section here and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.830 
down look in this section here and
across<00:01:24.929> here<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.149> look<00:01:27.149> for<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.420> best<00:01:27.630> image

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
across here and look for the best image

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.880 
across here and look for the best image
once<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.530> find<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.859> best<00:01:29.039> image<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:30.149> shade<00:01:30.450> in

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
once we find the best image we shade in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.389 
once we find the best image we shade in
the<00:01:31.890> corresponding<00:01:32.700> box<00:01:33.210> above<00:01:33.539> that<00:01:33.749> image

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
the corresponding box above that image

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.859 
the corresponding box above that image
most<00:01:35.399> of<00:01:35.520> them<00:01:35.640> good<00:01:35.880> couple<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.659> minor

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
most of them good couple of minor

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.069 
most of them good couple of minor
alterations<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.810> here<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> I've

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
alterations here and here that I've

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.190 
alterations here and here that I've
shaded<00:01:40.319> in<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.509> need<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
shaded in so now what we need to do is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.709 
shaded in so now what we need to do is
put<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.219> designjet<00:01:44.549> -<00:01:45.149> we

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
put this back in the designjet - we

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.450 
put this back in the designjet - we
program<00:01:46.139> it<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> tell<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.889> adjust

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
program it to tell it to adjust

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.020 
program it to tell it to adjust
accordingly<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> we've<00:01:50.639> got<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> color

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
accordingly so we've got the color

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
accordingly so we've got the color
cartridge<00:01:51.479> alignment<00:01:51.960> sheet<00:01:52.139> its<00:01:52.799> face<00:01:53.009> down

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
cartridge alignment sheet its face down

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090 
cartridge alignment sheet its face down
the<00:01:53.819> arrow<00:01:53.969> pointing<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.719> machine<00:01:55.100> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the arrow pointing into the machine in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.860 
the arrow pointing into the machine in
position<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.729> press<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> load<00:01:57.990> button

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.180 

so<00:02:02.870> with<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.080> sheet<00:02:03.320> successfully<00:02:04.010> loaded

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
so with the sheet successfully loaded

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.330 
so with the sheet successfully loaded
and<00:02:04.640> we've<00:02:05.420> got<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.630> steady<00:02:06.410> ready<00:02:06.860> light<00:02:07.100> on

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
and we've got a steady ready light on

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.370 
and we've got a steady ready light on
they're<00:02:07.520> not<00:02:07.640> flashing<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:08.990> need<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.229> do
