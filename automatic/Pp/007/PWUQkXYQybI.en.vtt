what the law states but the rule states
but<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.400> seems<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.960> particularly

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
but it seems that this is a particularly

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
but it seems that this is a particularly

benign form of ignorance on the part of
the<00:01:10.409> ref<00:01:10.590> who<00:01:10.830> called<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.549> thing<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:12.030> knows

the ref who called the thing he knows

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
the ref who called the thing he knows
that<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.049> exemption<00:01:13.680> exemptions<00:01:14.189> that

that you have exemption exemptions that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.620 
that you have exemption exemptions that
rule<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.670> religious<00:01:15.000> expression<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.570> he

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
rule for religious expression but he

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
rule for religious expression but he
didn't<00:01:16.049> recognize<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> religious

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.429 
didn't recognize this one as a religious
form<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.270> expression<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.229> gap

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
form of expression so it was just a gap

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
form of expression so it was just a gap
in<00:01:19.590> his<00:01:19.680> knowledge<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> does<00:01:20.820> highlight

anyway it was not even a close game but

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380 
anyway it was not even a close game but
it<00:01:39.960> does<00:01:40.350> bring<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.280> questions<00:01:41.520> about<00:01:41.939> how

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it does bring up questions about how

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
it does bring up questions about how
this<00:01:42.600> might<00:01:42.780> impact<00:01:42.840> future<00:01:43.380> games<00:01:43.770> were<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
this might impact future games were a

this might impact future games were a
15-yard<00:01:44.909> penalty<00:01:44.939> may<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:45.990> make<00:01:46.409> a

15-yard penalty may actually make a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
15-yard penalty may actually make a
difference<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:47.880> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
difference and that's where I think we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
difference and that's where I think we
need<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.450> things<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> NFL<00:01:49.619> has

get into all sorts of issues and other

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
get into all sorts of issues and other
games<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> future<00:02:58.409> well<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.920> course<00:02:58.950> they

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
games in the future well of course they

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.920 
games in the future well of course they
should<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.609> really<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> burden<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
should but really the burden is on the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.449 
should but really the burden is on the
ref<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.200> make<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.470> call<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.129> we're<00:03:02.310> also

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
ref to make the call but now we're also

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.890 
ref to make the call but now we're also
saying<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.939> burden<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.359> on<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.599> ref<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
saying that the burden is on the ref to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.410 
saying that the burden is on the ref to
interpret<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.159> form<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.489> expression<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.299> they

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
interpret the form of expression so they

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.910 
interpret the form of expression so they
can<00:03:06.569> know<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.810> letter<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.349> rule<00:03:07.620> within

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
can know the letter of the rule within

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.440 
can know the letter of the rule within
the<00:03:08.069> NFL<00:03:08.459> but<00:03:08.700> then<00:03:08.819> they<00:03:08.909> also<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.420> be

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the NFL but then they also have to be

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.530 
the NFL but then they also have to be
aware<00:03:09.629> now<00:03:10.590> apparently<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.849> there<00:03:12.269> are<00:03:12.389> all

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540

these<00:03:12.689> other<00:03:12.750> forms<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.470> does<00:03:13.620> open<00:03:13.859> up<00:03:13.950> some

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
these other forms and does open up some

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.770 
these other forms and does open up some
questions<00:03:14.489> about<00:03:14.609> whether<00:03:15.209> they<00:03:15.480> can

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
questions about whether they can

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.119 
questions about whether they can
interpret<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.349> if<00:03:16.409> they're<00:03:16.560> always<00:03:16.739> going<00:03:17.010> to

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
interpret and if they're always going to

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.949 
interpret and if they're always going to
interpret<00:03:17.400> those<00:03:17.579> correctly<00:03:18.030> exactly<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
interpret those correctly exactly and

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.180 
interpret those correctly exactly and
it's<00:03:19.049> tricky<00:03:19.260> because<00:03:19.410> there<00:03:19.620> are<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:19.949> many

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
it's tricky because there are so many

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.949 
it's tricky because there are so many
religions<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.849> world<00:03:20.879> right<00:03:21.299> now<00:03:21.449> in<00:03:21.840> this

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
religions in the world right now in this

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.119 
religions in the world right now in this
particular<00:03:22.440> case<00:03:22.650> we're<00:03:22.829> talking<00:03:22.889> about

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
particular case we're talking about

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.770 
particular case we're talking about
Islam<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.459> widely<00:03:23.970> recognised<00:03:24.480> I'm<00:03:24.750> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the world so you can argue that you may

the world so you can argue that you may
be<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.709> little<00:03:28.980> more<00:03:29.069> education<00:03:29.629> on<00:03:30.629> this

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
be a little more education on this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.780 
be a little more education on this
particular<00:03:31.709> case<00:03:31.919> would<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.340> helped<00:03:32.579> but<00:03:32.639> I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
particular case would have helped but I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.640 
particular case would have helped but I
think<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.510> need<00:03:33.659> a<00:03:33.690> lot<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.109> Education<00:03:34.620> in

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
think we need a lot of Education in

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.899 
think we need a lot of Education in

most of with the largest Muslim

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
population and they were unaware that

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.140 
population and they were unaware that
Indonesia<00:04:04.169> was<00:04:04.680> largely<00:04:05.099> much<00:04:05.370> Muslim<00:04:05.940> sure

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
Indonesia was largely much Muslim sure

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.330 
Indonesia was largely much Muslim sure
and<00:04:06.419> ignorant<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:07.199> bounds<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.859> world<00:04:08.069> and

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
and ignorant of bounds in the world and

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.530 
and ignorant of bounds in the world and
of<00:04:08.430> course<00:04:08.639> it's<00:04:08.790> going<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:08.970> spill<00:04:09.209> over<00:04:09.239> into

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
of course it's going to spill over into

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.960 
of course it's going to spill over into
the<00:04:09.690> NFL<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.379> I<00:04:10.620> guess<00:04:10.919> really<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.489> takeaway

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
the NFL so I guess really the takeaway

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.360 
the NFL so I guess really the takeaway
from<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.510> any<00:04:13.049> NFL<00:04:13.560> fan<00:04:13.829> even<00:04:14.129> if<00:04:14.280> you're

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
from this and any NFL fan even if you're

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.339 
from this and any NFL fan even if you're
not<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.549> fan<00:04:14.849> there's<00:04:15.359> an<00:04:15.510> expectation<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:16.229> in

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
not a fan there's an expectation that in

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.870 
not a fan there's an expectation that in
a<00:04:16.440> game<00:04:16.620> what<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.829> stakes<00:04:17.310> are<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:17.669> high<00:04:17.699> and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
a game what the stakes are so high and

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.159 
a game what the stakes are so high and
there's<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.239> much<00:04:18.359> money<00:04:18.630> involved<00:04:18.989> in

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
there's so much money involved in

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.689 
there's so much money involved in
prestige<00:04:19.530> involved<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> rest<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.579> to
