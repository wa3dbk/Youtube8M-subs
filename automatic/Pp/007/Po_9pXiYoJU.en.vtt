00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.080
 application

 so that not one that is the highest it is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.980
 you just have to go to the app store so you go to the app store 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.479
 then there exists in light version the relations 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.670
 for the menu 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.450
 pay 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 there you are talking about light version because I have not paid 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.920

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 you are witnessing 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.060
 so here you go 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 Oklahoma 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 the app run it fesci cost of 79 hundredths

 Graphite 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 and in fact m 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.250
 you can talk with them several characters you will understand after 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.860
 the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.410
 the same 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.570
 the the use 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.700
 the application what is it for 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 so I was responsible for light versions so elected also cozy fez 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 hackers who is also 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 having very often pennies 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.940
 you know 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.460
 characters 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910
 in the field of piracy 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.810
 so the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.020
 because for this parrot 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.450
 short according to the pam 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.700
 after that so you have here I download light version 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.019
 so classify 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.509
 each artist with his granddaughter leaned left 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.409
 the press that does this is tight in its near-bankruptcy mail will cap you 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.089
 have the aversion for 100 m 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.489
 following 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.099
 Anne Boyer done here 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.670
 for the story of the three little pigs you have the free version the country 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.189
 full 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.229
 these are hundredths 4 you also have kwasi fesci in the specialty or 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.909
 these three day stories about idyllic captives 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.979
 the sea 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.369
 the little younes 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.699
 alas the little girl 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.109
 and so they learn the paid version of 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.319
 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 so here I'm going to change that greens his act 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.580
 so the best 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.930
 me I change them all we wish them 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.809
 as you can see 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.609
 unity 6 th the dish 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.319
 the previous and the worst 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.639
 so for greens on live you can without me because the three characters 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.639
 so in total with the versions that always did with 4 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.119
 so to go away 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.060
 the place 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.879
 cissÃ© 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.129
 it's for the page 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.489
 because actually a few steps away 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 the defense is not the biggest all the head 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.699
 it's really 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.659
 in fact when we could see when I speak 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.659
 of a little character who 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.419
 a small microphone on the ground 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.199
 well it's not that head and neck 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.779
 for 100 m for the version 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:39.679
 roads 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.679
 if you want to change your face, you just have to adjust 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.769
 and when I see the version% shame 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.909
 I do not even want it 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.269
 so enough for the guy 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.059
 after if he wanted to adjust the street sensitivity just call on the 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.679
 peak and pond at the club roll 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.069
 just adjust the spell of volume the frequency 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.139
 at this conclave of the elite 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.439
 do what you want 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.439
 it's really not bad 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.419
 so there it is for the best the green man after for them 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.989
 necessarily by the company 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.870
 when you tell stories 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.710
 according to 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.650
 but I think that knows 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.229
 with the ipad 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.389
 Siniora 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.629
 broken panels 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.629
 when 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.930
 I the little pig 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.240
 This is a good game 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 wauquiez 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.939
 that's it for the little pig 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.990
 and after for snow white 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.419
 then sunday snow 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.419
 the witch and the seven names 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.419
 Hello 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.849
 I like to impose myself 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.059
 the Belgian round 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.510
 so as you can see 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.719
 from the mouth 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.669
 and on stage 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.669
 it's really true to say even so to semarang so that 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.759
 if they did not want to pay 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.610
 you can already download the free versions with the qatar would 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.229
 so it's really not bad 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.389
 that's otherwise you're going to have a good time too 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.789
 it was not planned cowboy games 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.699
 the president on his clients 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.490
 costs 62 cents are punished mans 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.490
 in fact 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.820
 you put the fonera 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.729
 e 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.099
 it provides a layer 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.099

 and what is at least what 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:06.590
 these are eleven of 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.599
 Success 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:09.939
