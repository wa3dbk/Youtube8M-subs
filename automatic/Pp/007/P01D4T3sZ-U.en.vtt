00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
a whole bunch of these not my usual fare

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.059 
a whole bunch of these not my usual fare
at<00:01:46.759> all<00:01:46.969> it<00:01:47.209> looks<00:01:47.420> like<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.689> bit<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.170> fun<00:01:48.590> romp

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069

at all it looks like a bit of a fun romp
a<00:01:49.609> bit<00:01:50.090> silly<00:01:50.359> bit<00:01:50.840> fun<00:01:51.109> but<00:01:51.770> sometimes<00:01:52.219> that's

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
a bit silly bit fun but sometimes that's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.149 
a bit silly bit fun but sometimes that's
why<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:52.789> need<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:54.259> last<00:01:54.469> one<00:01:54.679> is<00:01:54.829> how<00:01:55.100> to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
see I have rather a lot of other library
books<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.540> through<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.710> that's<00:02:22.860> my

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
books to get through so that's my

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.200

library<00:02:23.280> books<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.610> March<00:02:23.790> that's<00:02:24.060> not

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
library books for March that's not

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.790 
library books for March that's not
actually<00:02:24.570> for<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.870> whole<00:02:25.020> lot<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.260> March<00:02:25.530> of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
actually for the whole lot of March of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.020 
actually for the whole lot of March of
most<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> ones<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.580> got<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.760> at<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
most of the ones that I got out at the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.940 
most of the ones that I got out at the
beginning<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> month<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:28.320> already<00:02:28.710> been

beginning of the month have already been
read<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.670> returned<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.720> hopefully<00:02:31.080> I'll<00:02:31.200> get

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
