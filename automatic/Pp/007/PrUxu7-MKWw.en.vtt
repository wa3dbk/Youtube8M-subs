00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.090 

so<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.440> trick<00:00:23.590> I'm<00:00:23.680> gonna<00:00:23.770> teach<00:00:23.920> you<00:00:24.010> today

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
so the trick I'm gonna teach you today

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.580 
so the trick I'm gonna teach you today
is<00:00:24.370> inward<00:00:24.910> heel<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:26.230> reason<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.470> like

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
is inward heel and the reason I like

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.250 
is inward heel and the reason I like
inward<00:00:26.860> heels<00:00:27.040> is<00:00:27.580> because<00:00:27.940> it's<00:00:28.900> not<00:00:29.140> as

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
inward heels is because it's not as

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.929 
inward heels is because it's not as
common<00:00:29.440> as<00:00:29.590> like<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:29.770> tre<00:00:29.920> flip<00:00:30.130> or<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.369> hard<00:00:30.790> flip

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
common as like a tre flip or a hard flip

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.930 
common as like a tre flip or a hard flip
and<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.650> nice<00:00:33.250> because<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:33.550> can<00:00:33.700> start

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
and it's nice because you can start

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.869 
and it's nice because you can start
regular<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.870> land<00:00:34.989> regular<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:39.489> inward<00:00:39.760> heel

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
regular and land regular an inward heel

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.330 
regular and land regular an inward heel
is<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.150> combination<00:00:40.900> between<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.590> heel<00:00:41.830> flip<00:00:41.980> and

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
is a combination between a heel flip and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:54.580 
is a combination between a heel flip and
a<00:00:42.970> pop<00:00:43.150> shuvit

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.530 

so<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.890> foot<00:00:56.010> positioning<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.330> put<00:00:57.450> my

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
so for foot positioning I like to put my

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.570 
so for foot positioning I like to put my
front<00:00:57.750> foot<00:00:57.990> right<00:00:58.220> in<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.280> middle<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
front foot right in the middle of the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.820 
front foot right in the middle of the
board<00:00:59.720> and<00:01:00.720> I<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.110> like<00:01:01.200> my<00:01:01.350> toes<00:01:01.560> hang<00:01:01.710> off

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
board and I like I like my toes hang off

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.010 
board and I like I like my toes hang off
a<00:01:01.860> little<00:01:02.040> bit<00:01:02.220> and<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.810> to

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
a little bit and also I don't like to

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.830 
a little bit and also I don't like to
have<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.290> foot<00:01:04.500> angle<00:01:04.770> forward<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.280> backward

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
have my foot angle forward or backward

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.920 
have my foot angle forward or backward
just<00:01:06.840> perpendicular<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.480> my<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.780> foot

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
just perpendicular and then my back foot

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
just perpendicular and then my back foot
I<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.790> pocket

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I like to have it right in this pocket

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.230 
I like to have it right in this pocket
right<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:14.100> only<00:01:14.190> my<00:01:14.370> toes

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.150 

I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> most<00:01:22.260> common<00:01:22.530> mistake<00:01:22.770> with

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
I think the most common mistake with

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.910 
I think the most common mistake with
this<00:01:23.280> trick<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.670> um<00:01:24.480> instead<00:01:25.410> of<00:01:25.500> flicking<00:01:25.830> out

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this trick is um instead of flicking out

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280 
this trick is um instead of flicking out
and<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.580> board<00:01:26.790> flips<00:01:26.970> under<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> I've<00:01:28.140> seen

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and the board flips under you I've seen

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.570 
and the board flips under you I've seen
a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.590> people<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.010> where<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.370> um

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
a lot of people do it where they um

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.120 
a lot of people do it where they um
they'll<00:01:30.150> push<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.660> right<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> then

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
they'll push down right here and then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.680 
they'll push down right here and then
the<00:01:32.250> board<00:01:32.760> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> flips<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.390> somewhere

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
the board kind of flips like somewhere

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.820 
the board kind of flips like somewhere
over<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:34.290> they're<00:01:34.410> both<00:01:34.530> feet<00:01:34.740> are

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
over here and then they're both feet are

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.470 
over here and then they're both feet are
kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.130> hiding<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.940> I

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
kind of like hiding over here and I

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.710 
kind of like hiding over here and I
don't<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> looks<00:01:41.660> my<00:01:42.660> two

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
don't like the way it looks my two

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
don't like the way it looks my two
favorite<00:01:43.140> inward<00:01:43.740> heels<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.040> probably<00:01:44.280> Weger

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
favorite inward heels are probably Weger

parking lot a favor one two things I'd
like<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.800> emphasize<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> trick<00:01:59.700> first

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
like to emphasize with this trick first

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380 
like to emphasize with this trick first
of<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:01.490> make<00:02:02.490> sure<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.729> flicking<00:02:02.910> out<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
of all make sure you're flicking out I

can't stress that enough

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.219 
can't stress that enough
don't<00:02:05.369> push<00:02:05.610> down<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.330> make<00:02:07.050> sure<00:02:07.140> you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
to use that that curve to make the board

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.120 
to use that that curve to make the board
flip<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.660> second<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.130> really

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
flip and a second of all I really

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
pocket right here I keep it like right

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.860 
pocket right here I keep it like right
on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.760> edge<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.150> right<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> grip<00:02:18.660> tape

hard time with it
I'd<00:02:45.190> recommend<00:02:45.520> maybe<00:02:45.760> trying<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> nollie<00:02:46.510> or

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
I'd recommend maybe trying to nollie or

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.650 
I'd recommend maybe trying to nollie or
fakie<00:02:47.200> or<00:02:47.410> even<00:02:47.920> switch<00:02:48.420> regular<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.510> not

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
fakie or even switch regular is not

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.210 
fakie or even switch regular is not
necessarily<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.170> easiest<00:02:50.200> one<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:51.160> just

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
necessarily the easiest one it just

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.670 
necessarily the easiest one it just
really<00:02:51.490> depends<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> person<00:02:52.240> but<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:53.530> mean

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
really depends on the person but I mean

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.440 
really depends on the person but I mean
the<00:02:53.860> main<00:02:53.980> thing<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.280> keep<00:02:55.000> shred<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.300> keep

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the main thing is keep shred and keep

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.780 
the main thing is keep shred and keep
them<00:02:55.540> fun
