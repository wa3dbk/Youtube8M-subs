they're<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.840> opens<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.409> mind

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.770 

we<00:01:53.020> started<00:01:53.500> off<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:54.520> we<00:01:54.909> really<00:01:55.180> had<00:01:55.450> some

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
we started off like we really had some

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.840 
we started off like we really had some
kind<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.170> connection<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.920> chemistry<00:01:57.610> and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
kind of connection and chemistry and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.100 
kind of connection and chemistry and
then<00:01:58.570> we<00:01:58.960> had<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.410> kind<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.040> combine<00:02:00.280> our

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
then we had to kind of combine our

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.620 
then we had to kind of combine our
characters<00:02:02.110> together<00:02:02.790> I've<00:02:03.790> learned<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:04.390> much

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
characters together I've learned so much

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.140 
characters together I've learned so much
from<00:02:05.159> listening<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.369> streaming<00:02:06.790> players

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
from listening to the streaming players

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.680 
from listening to the streaming players
how<00:02:07.900> they<00:02:08.080> phrase<00:02:08.850> somehow<00:02:09.850> I<00:02:09.880> have<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.420> work

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
how they phrase somehow I have to work

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:41.849 
how they phrase somehow I have to work
out<00:02:10.840> how<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> blending

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.140 

we're<00:02:42.859> able<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.189> challenge<00:02:43.579> each<00:02:43.819> other<00:02:44.030> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
we're able to challenge each other and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.080 
we're able to challenge each other and
inspire<00:02:45.140> each<00:02:45.439> other<00:02:45.590> artistically<00:02:46.340> that

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
inspire each other artistically that

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.789 
inspire each other artistically that
feeling<00:02:47.480> when<00:02:47.599> you<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:48.200> come<00:02:48.409> back<00:02:48.620> and

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
feeling when you you come back and

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.709 
feeling when you you come back and
reunite<00:02:49.159> and<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.879> first<00:02:50.090> rehearsal<00:02:50.599> where

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
reunite and that first rehearsal where

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.059 
reunite and that first rehearsal where
everything<00:02:50.989> just<00:02:51.049> kind<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.319> falls<00:02:51.799> into<00:02:51.980> place

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
everything just kind of falls into place

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.190 
everything just kind of falls into place
and<00:02:52.430> clicks<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:53.269> why<00:02:53.599> we<00:02:54.139> were

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and clicks and that's why we were

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:16.900 
and clicks and that's why we were
playing<00:02:54.469> together

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.970
