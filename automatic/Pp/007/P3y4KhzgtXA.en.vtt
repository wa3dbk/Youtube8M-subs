00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.039
 In the last edition of the sea expo several topics of interest were presented 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.799
 for producers 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.240
 one of them was related to the production of sugarcane in the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.859
 that there is a concern about the low average yields that have 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.089
 currently our country 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.499
 the engineer take a measure of the direction of agrarian extension 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.870
 He made some practical guidelines for producers 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.640
 In order to improve these yield averages we are going to develop this 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 material 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.860
 sugarcane is a hard one that has its economic and social importance of 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.970
 our country 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.150
 Among its main applications are those of industrial form that 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.580
 sugar is the threat and fuel alcohol 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.840
 and in an artisanal way, the must cube and the honey 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 It is also widely used as fodder for animals 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.950
 For a good production in sugarcane cultivation it is important to follow 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.420
 the right recommendations 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.680
 according to the theater representative 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.130
 The first thing to do is an analysis to know the requirements 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.310
 of our soil 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.820
 in the conventional way I have recommended the use of each click or that of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.500
 our half uca canes in crops 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 steven and perennial 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.570
 we need 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.540
 rondos three applications cd agricultural lime 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.230
 there can be done 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.530
 percent is doing acts of the whole plot today after having 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.770
 prepared thefts 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.070
 that of application located in that case are used smaller 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.870
 quantities and it is recommended three thousand kilos one can use one thousand 500 kilos 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.990
 localized application 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.860
 and 1500 kilo what is missing after the first harvest 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 it is important to make a good selection of terrain 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.019
 and adequate soil preparation 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.569
 The recommended grounds are only the deep ones and with a low level of slope 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.989
 then comes the furrow, which consists of opening furrows of 25 to 30 centimeters 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.749
 depth etc the recommended distance is from one point 30 to one like 70 meters 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.269
 as for those few plantation 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.989
 It is recommended from February to March for early varieties and from August to 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:33.850
 September 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.780
 for medium or late varieties, the amount of seeds to be used is 10 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.749
 at 15 tons per hectare 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.929
 the secret of sugarcane 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.979
 age 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.519
 of the plant will be reused plant cane 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.499
 have 9 ados in bs 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.609
 d age 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.959
 palm 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.679
 plantation 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.989
 after they have the cuts that can be cast 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.739
 two ways 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.309
 stretching in the groove 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:09.669
 but this way I walk in the form from one hundred percent the base 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.639
 from stone bridge 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 I walk what on the tips and returning brings each train full 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.599
 that's what the plantation parties 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.439
 the covered one has to do five centimeters stage 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.979
 when we have some 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.239
 to a normal environment 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.860
 but when the dt pope drought has to try to cover up to 10 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.669
 centimeters 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.339
 what is the most 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:35.730
 the sugar cane begins to sprout from 8 to 22 days 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.340
 depending on the temperature it needs 20 to 32 degrees to rotate and a 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 average rainfall of 1200 to 1,500 millimeters per year being the time of 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.920
 growth from December to March the one with the highest requirement, then come the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.259
 cultural care that this plantation requires 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.899
 if done in a way 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.439
 it is conventional you have to do this activity fertilizer application 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.959
 it is again applied fertilizers generally 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.499
 when not 11 acesur harvest anything in the she-wolf bonus that starting it with organic can 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.839
 to be using it is cow time 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.400
 as a compost or you can also use 1 - betis 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.499
 in different doses 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.499
 the main problems that these crops go through 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.529
 the main problem we have in low performance 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.969
 that when not 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.309
 the technical recommendations 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.309
 for the Texan using varieties 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.789
 not adequate 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.870
 not respecting in the entity 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.660
 in when it's pipe plant is when we started doing 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.900
 low performance 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.840
 we also depend on the environment the amount of rain that must have 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.819
 the german shepherd 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.189
 older we do not have because the cultivation 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.759
 resists a poor person quite well 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.639
 but the handling itself 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.680
 choice of varieties 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.099
 Regarding the plantation season and the pubs 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.100
 the travel representative empathized 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.360
 on the importance of opting for varieties that have good potential for 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.279
 yield for producers 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.379
 and that it is also good performance for industries also the fall 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.220
 of cane 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220
 it should be benefit for the producer and for the industry 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.849
 So what the technician has to look for today 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.849
 try to balance 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.499
 the performance thundered micÃ³ that the producer has to receive 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.800
 and also the industrial performance that the industry has to have 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.029
 as for degree bris 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.210
 i in tons per hectare
