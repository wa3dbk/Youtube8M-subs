five ways how people get rich in
toribash<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.350> first<00:00:07.589> one<00:00:07.830> would<00:00:08.040> be

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
toribash the first one would be

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.549 
toribash the first one would be
marketing<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.599> marketing<00:00:10.049> is<00:00:10.139> basically

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
marketing so marketing is basically

marketing so marketing is basically
buying<00:00:11.009> and<00:00:11.250> selling<00:00:11.400> items<00:00:11.700> through<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
buying and selling items through the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.049 
buying and selling items through the
marketing<00:00:12.990> system<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:13.620> well<00:00:13.950> as<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.490> items

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
marketing system as well as the items

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.140 
marketing system as well as the items
board<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.320> toribash<00:00:16.800> form<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.789> basically

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
board in the toribash form so basically

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.380 
board in the toribash form so basically
the<00:00:18.359> idea<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.890> buy<00:00:20.130> low<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.640> sell<00:00:21.060> high

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the idea is to to buy low and sell high

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540 
the idea is to to buy low and sell high
so<00:00:22.050> buy<00:00:22.320> things<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.710> cheaper<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.250> sell<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
so buy things for cheaper and sell it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.450 
so buy things for cheaper and sell it
for<00:00:23.670> higher<00:00:23.849> and<00:00:24.210> yeah<00:00:24.930> generally<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.980> can

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
for higher and yeah generally this can

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
for higher and yeah generally this can
work<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.849> great<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.660> start<00:00:28.289> learning<00:00:28.679> how

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
work out great if you start learning how

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.669 
work out great if you start learning how
much<00:00:29.189> things<00:00:29.490> cost<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:31.349> know<00:00:31.560> how

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
much things cost and and really know how

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
if you make art that might be a cool way

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.410 
if you make art that might be a cool way
to<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.650> TC<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> third<00:01:06.840> way<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.680> events

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
to make TC the third way is to do events

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
to make TC the third way is to do events
events<00:01:09.420> okay<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.530> much<00:01:10.740> in-game<00:01:10.980> events

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
events okay not so much in-game events

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
events okay not so much in-game events
but<00:01:11.940> sometimes<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.020> journeys<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
but sometimes there are journeys that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.400 
but sometimes there are journeys that
are<00:01:13.590> huge<00:01:14.220> amounts<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.030> prizes<00:01:15.510> in<00:01:15.900> games<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
are huge amounts of prizes in games so

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.350 
are huge amounts of prizes in games so
so<00:01:16.830> yeah<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.250> could<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.430> in-game<00:01:17.820> journeys

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
so yeah they could be in-game journeys

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960 
so yeah they could be in-game journeys
or<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.690> can<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> farm<00:01:19.260> events<00:01:19.770> things<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.130> for

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
or it can be farm events things like for

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.640 
or it can be farm events things like for
example<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.900> hosting<00:01:22.260> right<00:01:22.440> now<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
example what I'm hosting right now the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
Tauri games which it has a hundred k TC

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.220 
Tauri games which it has a hundred k TC
in<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.920> pot<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.840> yeah

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
in the pot right now and and like yeah

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.290 
in the pot right now and and like yeah
like<00:01:28.440> seriously<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.010> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.210> do

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
like seriously like you can just do

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.480 
like seriously like you can just do
events<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.020> hope<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.470> win<00:01:31.650> though<00:01:31.980> it's<00:01:32.370> very

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
events and hope to win though it's very

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.250 
events and hope to win though it's very
hard<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.450> win<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> you're<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.990> be

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
hard to win and you're gonna be

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.530 
hard to win and you're gonna be
competing<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.860> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> people<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
competing with a lot of people the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
competing with a lot of people the
fourth<00:01:36.810> way<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.560> most<00:01:37.710> easiest

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
fourth way and probably the most easiest

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.910 
fourth way and probably the most easiest
way<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:39.120> sustained<00:01:39.630> real<00:01:39.900> money<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
way is sustained real money this is you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.250 
way is sustained real money this is you
can<00:01:41.070> either<00:01:41.250> buy<00:01:41.550> TC<00:01:42.030> from<00:01:42.240> people<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
can either buy TC from people in the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.620 
can either buy TC from people in the
items<00:01:43.830> board<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.340> though<00:01:45.150> you<00:01:45.300> have<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.510> be

items board there though you have to be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
items board there though you have to be
very<00:01:45.840> careful<00:01:46.200> people<00:01:46.650> sometimes<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.520> kind

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
very careful people sometimes are kind

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.540 
very careful people sometimes are kind
of<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:48.780> sketchy<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.250> scammed
