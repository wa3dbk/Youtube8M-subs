00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 eiken from YouTube speaks a video 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.100
 to teach them what can be done 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.069
 same of how to touch your polarity with 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.690
 this multimeter on the bass already know 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.120
 that some low crime with a coil 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 and folded it comes like this and pass it to teach 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.039
 how to play them or on a double bass 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.020
 this coil is supposedly a bass 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.609
 two points double coil and well let's 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.769
 take out the two coils to be sure 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.510
 that so true that is two or more because if 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 is a different number is because one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.900
 one of the coil this mother ada is wrong 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.910
 post is hitting against something the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.640
 coil or yes and then you have to check 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.989
 that this bass is good and you have to put 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 here as always as I told you the other 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.570
 Once we put the multimeter to what it seems 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.610
 like horse horseshoe that puts nothing 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 With the feet of you fall I do not know what 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 garment no longer the signal is ready to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 read and well we put this sea team not 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 we can do it so I can put the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.470
 terminal open it and put inside the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 multimeter as pig also 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:05.070
 what to do 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 can see lee 2.1 2.0 and it came out 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.690
 so what does it mean that although 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.400
 it is if it is 2 or more we remove this 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.920
 we turn around does not shorten the video to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 that they see that it is okay now we do 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.620
 the same we put here in us 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.480
 more you are and here is 2.3 which is 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.200
 practically the same as 2.0 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.090
 formally is that this 3 or 4 as well as 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 up to 5 you allow it to be around 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 what are you looking for that are 2 or more that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.110
 in this case as I said are two coils 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 of 2 or more I know it's okay that yes that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 is under is very well that will be 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.610
 paying and as I said yes yes yes it's wrong 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.310
 coil wrong aligned whatever 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.200
 to warn multimeter as I said if I 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.640
 you move a little bit as you can see 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.620
 the numbers 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.260
 is that they look like I know that this one does not touch 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.000
 it's okay 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.250
 under put on a surface well that 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 be as I said moving in nothing and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.950
 we put as you can see here it's like 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.950
 check it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.700
 2.2 1.3 and the other as they differ they were 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.150
 2.1 and 2.0 and how can you see that is how 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.560
 hit the eyes in their lows and to 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.540
 know that your bass is fine if they want 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.670
 buy a bass and have a multimeter and 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.350
 they want to go take their multimeter to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 check the bass before buying it 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.470
 always if the bass is used, take a 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.260
 I assure you that it will help you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.660
 much in two purchases so they know that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.520
 that bass is fine and all that stuck and 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.989
 Well, this is what I teach that is 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.190
 You can do this the same if you have not 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.200
 seen the other video that he was 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.450
 speaking I leave them here up or you 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.550
 I leave them at the end of where and therefore 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.550
 Well, come on, the proxy video page
