at<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> remove<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.860> radiator<00:00:11.190> all<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
at how to remove the radiator all that

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.009 
at how to remove the radiator all that
crap<00:00:11.910> there's<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> separate<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:12.990> that

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
crap there's a separate video for that

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.570 
crap there's a separate video for that
so<00:00:13.349> let's<00:00:13.559> just<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.889> right<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.280> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
so let's just get right to it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
once the rat and fans all that out I'm

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.019 
once the rat and fans all that out I'm
going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> remove<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.250> alternator<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.970> the

going to remove the alternator and the
alternator<00:00:18.390> bracket<00:00:18.630> because<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.199> got<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
alternator bracket because it's got the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.080

access to the timing chain cover next

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
access to the timing chain cover next
steps<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.340> remove<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.760> crank

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
steps going to be is to remove the crank

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
steps going to be is to remove the crank
pulley<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.529> start<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> remove<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
pulley and then start to remove the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
pulley and then start to remove the
timing<00:00:32.910> case<00:00:33.120> chain<00:00:33.480> itself<00:00:39.469> alright<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.620> need

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
timing case chain itself alright we need

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.369 
timing case chain itself alright we need
to<00:00:40.980> extract<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.270> crank<00:00:42.570> pulley<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to extract the crank pulley so this is

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.889 
to extract the crank pulley so this is
what<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.890> use<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> there<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
what we're going to use get in there and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:01:03.529 
what we're going to use get in there and
rip<00:00:46.140> her<00:00:46.260> off<00:01:01.550> we're<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.640> start<00:01:03.090> removing

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
rip her off we're gonna start removing

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.030 
rip her off we're gonna start removing
the<00:01:03.660> four<00:01:03.899> bolts<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> bottom<00:01:04.710> other

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the four bolts on the bottom other

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
the four bolts on the bottom other
timing<00:01:05.460> chain<00:01:05.670> cover<00:01:05.900> right<00:01:06.900> along<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
timing chain cover right along the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.820 
timing chain cover right along the
bottom<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> oil<00:01:07.799> pan<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
bottom of the oil pan right down there I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.230 
bottom of the oil pan right down there I
know<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> lied<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> couple<00:01:11.939> more

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
know I lied but there's a couple more

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
know I lied but there's a couple more
right<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.689> saves<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> couple<00:01:13.320> more<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.680> this

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
right there saves a couple more in this

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
right there saves a couple more in this
side<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.520> can't<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.869> let's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
side you really can't see but now let's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:40.399 
side you really can't see but now let's
remove<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> rest<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> them

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.260 

so<00:01:41.409> I<00:01:41.470> did<00:01:41.710> right<00:01:41.950> now<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.490> put<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.850> bolt<00:01:43.090> back

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
so I did right now I put the bolt back

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.910 
so I did right now I put the bolt back
in<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.630> crank<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.110> we<00:01:44.229> have<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.470> line<00:01:44.620> up<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
in the crank and we have to line up the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.070 
in the crank and we have to line up the
timing<00:01:45.190> marks<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.510> one<00:01:46.660> there<00:01:46.869> with

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
timing marks with that one there with

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.540 
timing marks with that one there with
the<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:47.320> down<00:01:47.560> there<00:01:47.770> before<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:48.130> pull<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
the one down there before I pull the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.210 
the one down there before I pull the
timing<00:01:48.880> chain<00:01:48.909> off<00:01:50.940> fucking<00:01:51.940> drift<00:01:52.270> camera

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
timing chain off fucking drift camera

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.740 
timing chain off fucking drift camera
not<00:01:54.220> be<00:01:54.369> better<00:01:54.580> for<00:01:54.820> wide-angle<00:01:55.360> views<00:01:55.600> with

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
not be better for wide-angle views with

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:10.590 
not be better for wide-angle views with
fucking<00:02:06.600> works<00:02:08.130> works<00:02:09.130> pretty<00:02:09.429> much<00:02:09.610> all

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
fucking works works pretty much all

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.210 
fucking works works pretty much all
right<00:02:10.780> our<00:02:10.899> next<00:02:10.929> steps<00:02:11.380> move<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.980> bull's

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
right our next steps move that bull's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.860 
right our next steps move that bull's
right<00:02:12.489> there<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.120> pull<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> timing

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
right there so you can pull the timing

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:35.070 
right there so you can pull the timing
chain<00:02:32.550> now<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.820> timing<00:02:34.090> chains<00:02:34.450> off<00:02:34.750> we

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
chain now that the timing chains off we

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.020 
chain now that the timing chains off we
need<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.350> go<00:02:35.500> around<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.250> scrape<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:36.940> this
