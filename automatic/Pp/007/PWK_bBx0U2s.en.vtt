how<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.179> make<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.629> tab<00:00:04.470> bar<00:00:04.710> application<00:00:05.009> in

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
how to make a tab bar application in

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.980 
how to make a tab bar application in
Xcode<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.170> let's<00:00:07.319> open<00:00:07.560> up<00:00:07.830> Xcode<00:00:08.480> let's<00:00:09.480> go

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
Xcode so let's open up Xcode let's go

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.820 
Xcode so let's open up Xcode let's go
into<00:00:10.469> new<00:00:11.429> project<00:00:12.059> obviously<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.559> want<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
into new project obviously we want to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.640 
into new project obviously we want to
pick<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.309> bar<00:00:14.549> application<00:00:15.410> save<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> as

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
pick at a bar application save it as

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
pick at a bar application save it as
whatever<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.130> want<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.730> them<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.180> call

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it tab bar education but it's fine now

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 
it tab bar education but it's fine now
you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.789> add<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> coding<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.570> add<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you can add the coding you can add the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.500 
you can add the coding you can add the
content<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> simple<00:00:33.329> one

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.299 

let's<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.660> hope<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.160> any

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
let's just hope we don't have to do any

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.530 
let's just hope we don't have to do any
coding<00:00:38.629> unless<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.160> want<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> add<00:00:41.399> content<00:00:41.610> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
coding unless you want to add content so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
coding unless you want to add content so
we<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.930> main<00:00:43.200> window<00:00:43.680> xib<00:00:44.129> under<00:00:44.489> our

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
we can go to main window xib under our

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.819 
we can go to main window xib under our
resources<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> interface<00:00:46.559> file<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
resources or in the interface file a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.760 
resources or in the interface file a
bill<00:00:47.039> builder<00:00:47.760> files<00:00:47.940> whichever<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.079> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
bill builder files whichever one you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.119 
bill builder files whichever one you
prefer

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
prefer

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
prefer

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so as you open up you see you have two

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.959 
so as you open up you see you have two
views<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:55.280> first<00:00:56.280> view<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.640> second

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
views right now first view and second

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.529 
views right now first view and second
two<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.890> many<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.539> just

two so if you want many more just

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.899 
two so if you want many more just
highlight<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> fine<00:01:02.430> copy<00:01:03.409> ctrl<00:01:04.580> C<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
highlight it it's fine copy ctrl C and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
highlight it it's fine copy ctrl C and
then<00:01:06.119> control<00:01:06.659> movie<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.549> as

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then control movie and you can do as

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
then control movie and you can do as
many<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.320> case<00:01:10.530> let's

it<00:02:25.379> but<00:02:26.379> for<00:02:26.709> each<00:02:26.860> one

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
it but for each one

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.759 
it but for each one
um<00:02:27.549> if<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.299> let's<00:02:28.599> say<00:02:28.750> say<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.049> wanted<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.560> do

um if you let's say say you wanted to do

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.490 
um if you let's say say you wanted to do
different<00:02:30.129> colors<00:02:30.510> for<00:02:31.510> each<00:02:31.659> page<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.319> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
can drag in a view and just make that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.839 
can drag in a view and just make that
red<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.470> keep<00:02:41.470> doing<00:02:41.769> that<00:02:41.859> for<00:02:42.159> each<00:02:42.280> one<00:02:42.579> and

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
red and keep doing that for each one and

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.149

in<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.639> view<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.180> then<00:02:55.389> drag<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.139> label<00:02:56.170> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
in a view and then drag in a label and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.729 
in a view and then drag in a label and
just<00:02:57.790> write<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.359> this<00:02:59.340> this<00:03:00.340> end<00:03:00.639> app<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.739> this

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
just write it this this end app and this

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.020 
just write it this this end app and this
and<00:03:03.579> that's<00:03:04.170> loops<00:03:05.170> are<00:03:05.579> pretty<00:03:06.579> much<00:03:06.760> how<00:03:06.970> you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and that's loops are pretty much how you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.229 
and that's loops are pretty much how you
make<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.959> basis<00:03:08.349> for<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.790> tab<00:03:09.790> bar<00:03:10.859> so<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:13.060> can

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
make the basis for a tab bar so we can

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.149 
make the basis for a tab bar so we can
drag<00:03:13.389> in<00:03:13.540> another<00:03:13.780> review<00:03:13.930> I'll<00:03:14.470> build<00:03:15.040> them

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159
