I guess if you want please okay so this
is<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> pizza<00:00:05.580> box<00:00:05.730> flyer<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> PDF<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:09.480> I

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
is a pizza box flyer a PDF and the I

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.780 
is a pizza box flyer a PDF and the I
built<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.500> ten<00:00:10.740> years<00:00:10.920> ago<00:00:11.040> back<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
built in about ten years ago back in the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.799 
built in about ten years ago back in the
day<00:00:11.940> before<00:00:12.120> flight<00:00:12.480> controllers<00:00:13.219> and<00:00:14.809> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
day before flight controllers and and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.930 
day before flight controllers and and
now<00:00:16.379> I've<00:00:16.560> modified<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.220> with<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.520> open<00:00:17.789> arrow

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
now I've modified it with the open arrow

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.179 
now I've modified it with the open arrow
to<00:00:18.060> VTOL<00:00:19.189> firmware<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.270> kk2<00:00:21.720> hardware<00:00:22.230> so

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
to VTOL firmware and the kk2 hardware so

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.839 
to VTOL firmware and the kk2 hardware so
that<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.880> could<00:00:24.180> test<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:25.050> demonstrate<00:00:25.849> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that I could test out demonstrate the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.580 
that I could test out demonstrate the
ability<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.539> firmware<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> handle<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
ability of that firmware to handle a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.950 
ability of that firmware to handle a
tail<00:00:28.800> sitter<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.210> actually<00:00:30.449> isn't<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
tail sitter now this actually isn't the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.359 
tail sitter now this actually isn't the
tail<00:00:31.230> sitter<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.590> doesn't<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
tail sitter just doesn't have the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.459 
tail sitter just doesn't have the
landing<00:00:32.730> gear<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> be

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
landing gear for it but it's going to be

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.910 
landing gear for it but it's going to be
flying<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> tail<00:00:35.730> sitter<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.140> kind<00:00:37.770> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
flying as a tail sitter in that kind of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.990 
flying as a tail sitter in that kind of
a<00:00:38.100> mode<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.129> let<00:00:41.129> me<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.370> set<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> down<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
a mode so let me just set it down for a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
a mode so let me just set it down for a
second<00:00:42.329> okay<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.789> motor<00:00:51.030> power<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.920> I'll

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
second okay we have motor power and I'll

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
second okay we have motor power and I'll
go<00:00:53.219> ahead<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> start<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> hover<00:00:54.480> mode

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
go ahead and start off in the hover mode

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760 
go ahead and start off in the hover mode
you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.340> Auto<00:00:57.059> stabilizing<00:00:57.960> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you can see it's Auto stabilizing you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520 
you can see it's Auto stabilizing you
see<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> lavon's<00:00:59.609> moving<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> tilt<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
see the a lavon's moving when I tilt it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
see the a lavon's moving when I tilt it
this<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.010> example<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.699> come<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this way for example they come up and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.750 
this way for example they come up and
when<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> twist<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:05.189> respond<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
when I twist it they they respond to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
when I twist it they they respond to
keep<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> straight<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> we've<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> little

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
keep it straight so we've got a little

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.110 
keep it straight so we've got a little
bit<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> wind<00:01:08.400> from<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> left<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.740> anyway

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.970 

and<00:01:17.120> right<00:01:17.390> now<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:17.810> flying<00:01:18.140> as<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:18.800> were

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
and right now it's flying as if it were

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.840 
and right now it's flying as if it were
a<00:01:19.010> quadcopter<00:01:19.630> or<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.740> multicopter<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.550> my

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
a quadcopter or a multicopter that is my

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.810 
a quadcopter or a multicopter that is my
control<00:01:23.330> scheme<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.260> manner<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:28.490> I'm

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
control scheme is in that manner and I'm

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.550 
control scheme is in that manner and I'm
actually<00:01:29.000> fighting<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.810> wind<00:01:30.140> right<00:01:30.380> now

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
actually fighting this wind right now

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.200 
actually fighting this wind right now
which<00:01:30.770> is<00:01:30.920> lime<00:01:31.160> laying<00:01:31.430> on<00:01:31.550> my<00:01:31.700> back<00:01:31.880> trying

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
which is lime laying on my back trying

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.440 
which is lime laying on my back trying
to<00:01:32.270> get<00:01:32.450> back<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.810> us<00:01:33.220> but<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:34.850> let's<00:01:35.060> go<00:01:35.210> ahead

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
to get back to us but so let's go ahead

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.290 
to get back to us but so let's go ahead
and<00:01:35.600> do<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.170> other<00:01:36.200> way<00:01:36.380> around<00:01:37.300> it's

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
and do it the other way around it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.120 
and do it the other way around it's
because<00:01:38.900> I'm<00:01:39.080> just<00:01:39.110> more<00:01:39.500> comfortable<00:01:39.740> as<00:01:40.100> a

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
because I'm just more comfortable as a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.110 
because I'm just more comfortable as a
pilot<00:01:40.520> being<00:01:40.700> on<00:01:40.850> my<00:01:41.030> yeah<00:01:41.210> being<00:01:41.930> upright<00:01:43.120> one

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
pilot being on my yeah being upright one

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.670 
pilot being on my yeah being upright one
of<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.270> reasons<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.660> do<00:01:44.720> this<00:01:45.020> with<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.380> open

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
of the reasons I do this with the open

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.310 
of the reasons I do this with the open
arrow<00:01:45.830> VTOL<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.610> because<00:01:47.000> I'm<00:01:47.840> not<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.140> good

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
arrow VTOL is because I'm not a good

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.640 
arrow VTOL is because I'm not a good
enough<00:01:48.440> pilot<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:48.979> do<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.250> by<00:01:49.490> myself

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
enough pilot to do this by myself

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.710 
enough pilot to do this by myself
but<00:01:52.040> with<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.490> flight<00:01:52.850> controller<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.479> course

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
but with the flight controller of course

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.210 
but with the flight controller of course
we<00:01:53.960> all<00:01:54.110> become<00:01:54.440> much<00:01:54.619> better<00:01:54.770> pilots<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:58.040> here

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
we all become much better pilots so here

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.710 
we all become much better pilots so here
I'm<00:01:58.369> still<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> hover<00:01:59.060> mode<00:01:59.300> even<00:01:59.630> though

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
I'm still in the hover mode even though

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.790 
I'm still in the hover mode even though
I'm<00:01:59.869> practically<00:02:00.470> flying<00:02:00.830> right<00:02:01.100> now<00:02:01.130> and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
I'm practically flying right now and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.620 
I'm practically flying right now and
this<00:02:03.800> wind<00:02:04.100> just<00:02:04.490> makes<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.090> can't<00:02:05.390> hover

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
this wind just makes it so I can't hover

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.180 
this wind just makes it so I can't hover
vertically<00:02:08.259> alright<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.500> let's<00:02:09.709> see<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
vertically alright so let's see what the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.360 
vertically alright so let's see what the
airplane<00:02:10.520> can<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.940> as<00:02:11.120> an<00:02:11.270> airplane<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:12.370> now

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
airplane can do as an airplane and now

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.400 
airplane can do as an airplane and now
I'm<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.670> regular<00:02:13.850> airplane<00:02:14.780> mode<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.170> way<00:02:15.290> it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
I'm in regular airplane mode the way it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.449 
I'm in regular airplane mode the way it
flew<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:15.830> years<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.220> years<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:18.370> there's<00:02:19.370> an

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
flew for years and years and there's an

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.910 
flew for years and years and there's an
airplane<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.299> fun<00:02:20.480> airplane<00:02:20.920> except

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
airplane it's just a fun airplane except

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.080 
airplane it's just a fun airplane except
for<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.100> fact<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.370> winds<00:02:22.640> blowing<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.030> away

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
for the fact that winds blowing it away

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.350 
for the fact that winds blowing it away
from<00:02:23.360> us<00:02:23.480> here<00:02:24.580> let's<00:02:25.580> bring<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.970> back<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.299> a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
from us here let's bring it back in a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.810 
from us here let's bring it back in a
little<00:02:26.510> closer<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:27.049> can<00:02:27.110> see<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:28.670> it's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
little closer so we can see it see it's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.930 
little closer so we can see it see it's
still<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> very<00:02:29.299> gentle<00:02:29.810> fun<00:02:30.260> airplane<00:02:30.940> it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
still a very gentle fun airplane it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.630 
still a very gentle fun airplane it
always<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.709> has<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.739> few<00:02:34.040> little<00:02:34.250> tricks<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
always was has a few little tricks it

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.800 
always was has a few little tricks it
likes<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.000> do<00:02:35.830> see<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.420> well<00:02:38.420> maybe<00:02:38.630> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
likes to do see if I can well maybe that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:55.190 
likes to do see if I can well maybe that
one<00:02:38.959> very<00:02:39.230> pretty<00:02:39.470> bit<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.180> into<00:02:41.330> it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.479 

now<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.190> can't<00:02:56.520> fly<00:02:56.819> come<00:02:57.630> on<00:02:57.840> I'm<00:02:58.830> not<00:02:59.160> making

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
now it can't fly come on I'm not making

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.610 
now it can't fly come on I'm not making
it<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.730> good<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.900> good<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.230> bring<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> back

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
it look good it's good and bring it back

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:24.370 
it look good it's good and bring it back
here

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.410 

and<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.980> ten<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.280> power

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.290 

do<00:03:30.870> pretty<00:03:31.080> much<00:03:31.170> anything<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.710> wanted<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.070> do

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
do pretty much anything you wanted to do

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.070 
do pretty much anything you wanted to do
except<00:03:33.300> knife-edge

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
except knife-edge

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.380 
except knife-edge
now<00:03:34.680> that's<00:03:34.860> an<00:03:35.040> aerodynamic<00:03:35.670> limitation<00:03:36.270> has

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
now that's an aerodynamic limitation has

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.670 
now that's an aerodynamic limitation has
nothing<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:36.990> with<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.200> flight<00:03:37.410> controller

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
nothing to do with the flight controller

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.380 
nothing to do with the flight controller
how<00:03:40.680> long<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.070> fly<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:42.950> think<00:03:43.950> well<00:03:44.580> 10<00:03:45.360> minutes

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
how long can fly I think well 10 minutes

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.720 
how long can fly I think well 10 minutes
on<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.080> battery<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.800> depends<00:03:47.160> on<00:03:47.250> how<00:03:47.460> hard<00:03:47.580> I

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
on this battery it depends on how hard I

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.090 
on this battery it depends on how hard I
push<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:48.150> I'm<00:03:48.840> not<00:03:49.110> pushing<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.560> very<00:03:49.740> hard<00:03:49.950> I

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
push it I'm not pushing it very hard I

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.220 
push it I'm not pushing it very hard I
very<00:03:50.400> rarely<00:03:50.460> fly<00:03:51.120> at<00:03:51.390> full<00:03:51.600> throttle

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
very rarely fly at full throttle

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.320 
very rarely fly at full throttle
it<00:03:52.710> just<00:03:52.950> doesn't<00:03:53.160> need<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.670> mean<00:03:53.820> full

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
it just doesn't need it I mean full

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.960 
it just doesn't need it I mean full
throttle<00:03:54.750> looks<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:55.140> oh<00:03:55.410> my<00:03:55.800> gosh<00:03:55.980> what<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:56.880> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
throttle looks like oh my gosh what do I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:17.360 
throttle looks like oh my gosh what do I
need<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.180> much<00:03:57.330> power<00:03:57.630> for<00:04:14.690> control<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:16.370> in

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
need that much power for control and in

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.650 
need that much power for control and in
this<00:04:17.549> particular<00:04:17.790> plane<00:04:18.390> has<00:04:18.630> a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
this particular plane has a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.650 
this particular plane has a
characteristic<00:04:19.170> where<00:04:20.120> because<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.299> motors

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
characteristic where because the motors

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.529 
characteristic where because the motors
eye<00:04:22.080> out<00:04:22.590> for<00:04:22.650> away<00:04:23.340> from

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.529 

it<00:04:28.539> wants<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.900> rap<00:04:29.169> some<00:04:29.500> time<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.330> I'm<00:04:31.419> gonna

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
it wants to rap some time so I'm gonna

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.059 
it wants to rap some time so I'm gonna
keep<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.020> short<00:04:32.379> flight<00:04:32.590> because<00:04:32.830> we<00:04:32.919> got

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
keep this a short flight because we got

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.529 
keep this a short flight because we got
other<00:04:33.250> swings<00:04:33.550> video<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:37.060> I'm<00:04:37.150> gonna<00:04:37.300> bring

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
other swings video and I'm gonna bring

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.029 
other swings video and I'm gonna bring
it<00:04:37.690> back<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.110> then<00:04:38.199> I'm<00:04:38.319> gonna<00:04:38.470> try<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.889> put

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
it back and then I'm gonna try and put

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.610 
it back and then I'm gonna try and put
it<00:04:39.129> in<00:04:39.250> hover<00:04:39.460> mode<00:04:39.810> or<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.960> am<00:04:41.139> gonna<00:04:41.289> put<00:04:41.530> it

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
it in hover mode or I am gonna put it

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.379 
it in hover mode or I am gonna put it
hover<00:04:41.830> mode<00:04:42.099> but<00:04:42.310> then<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.699> wind<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.210> going

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
hover mode but then this wind is going

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:57.780 
hover mode but then this wind is going
to<00:04:43.479> make<00:04:43.629> things<00:04:43.840> interesting

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.580 

hopefully<00:04:58.600> make<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.780> look<00:04:59.020> like<00:04:59.140> anyone<00:04:59.500> I'm

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
hopefully make it look like anyone I'm

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.240 
hopefully make it look like anyone I'm
doing<00:04:59.860> here

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.020 

so<00:05:05.250> that's<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.670> twin<00:05:06.180> pizza<00:05:06.840> box
