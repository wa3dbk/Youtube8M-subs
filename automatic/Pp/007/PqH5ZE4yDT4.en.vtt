because of the very reason that you said

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
because of the very reason that you said
right<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.110> they've<00:00:34.559> been<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
right there because they've been in the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
right there because they've been in the
closet<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.670> long<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.149> once<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.600> come

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
closet for so long and once they come

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.330 
closet for so long and once they come
out<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.559> back<00:00:37.710> inside<00:00:37.860> of

out they don't want to go back inside of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.819 
out they don't want to go back inside of
it<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.960> guys<00:00:40.260> don't<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it so I think you guys don't have to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
it so I think you guys don't have to
break<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.790> maybe<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.450> help<00:00:42.660> him<00:00:42.930> ease

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
break up but maybe you can help him ease

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
break up but maybe you can help him ease
him<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> closet<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
him out of the closet because it is a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
him out of the closet because it is a
process<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.550> know<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.879> you're<00:00:48.000> willing

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
process and you know if you're willing

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
process and you know if you're willing
to<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:49.140> through<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.829> him<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to go through that with him and I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.250 
to go through that with him and I
suggest<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> stay<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.360> him<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
