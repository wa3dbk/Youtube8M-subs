metroid<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.530> long<00:02:07.710> time<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.399> had

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
metroid for a long time and then we had

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.680 
metroid for a long time and then we had
found<00:02:08.849> out<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> head<00:02:09.509> had<00:02:09.660> been

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
found out that a head had been

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.150 
found out that a head had been
outsourced<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.120> retro<00:02:12.120> studios

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
outsourced to retro studios

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640 
outsourced to retro studios
and<00:02:13.280> they<00:02:13.430> made<00:02:13.640> metroid<00:02:14.360> prime<00:02:14.650> fairly

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
and they made metroid prime fairly

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.470 
and they made metroid prime fairly
certain<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.550> stuff<00:02:16.790> off<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.000> top<00:02:17.270> my<00:02:17.300> head

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
certain of the stuff off the top my head

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000 
certain of the stuff off the top my head
but<00:02:17.750> feel<00:02:17.990> free<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.320> correct<00:02:18.560> me<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:18.980> the

but feel free to correct me in the
comments<00:02:19.250> below<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.270> my<00:02:20.750> point<00:02:20.990> being<00:02:21.170> that

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
comments below so my point being that

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.630 
comments below so my point being that
when<00:02:22.820> an<00:02:22.970> individual<00:02:23.510> dies<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.430> there's<00:02:25.430> no

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
when an individual dies and there's no

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.000 
when an individual dies and there's no
clear<00:02:26.090> successor<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:27.320> know<00:02:27.440> there's<00:02:27.680> no<00:02:27.860> one

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
clear successor you know there's no one

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.300 
clear successor you know there's no one
that<00:02:28.490> he's<00:02:28.760> taught<00:02:29.180> what<00:02:29.840> he<00:02:30.080> knows<00:02:30.320> like<00:02:30.710> this

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
that he's taught what he knows like this

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.160 
that he's taught what he knows like this
is<00:02:31.490> how<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.700> do<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.750> how<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.900> make

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
is how you do this this is how you make

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.350 
is how you do this this is how you make
up<00:02:33.350> Mario<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.980> make<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> good<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.240> know

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
up Mario and you make it good you know

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.500 
up Mario and you make it good you know
you<00:02:35.420> look<00:02:35.720> over<00:02:35.900> at<00:02:36.140> sonic<00:02:36.590> man<00:02:37.360> just<00:02:38.360> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
you look over at sonic man just a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.660 
you look over at sonic man just a
another<00:02:38.930> prime<00:02:39.410> example<00:02:39.440> right<00:02:40.130> there<00:02:40.160> I'm

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
another prime example right there I'm

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.310 
another prime example right there I'm
not<00:02:40.850> saying<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.420> Metroid's<00:02:41.870> that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
not saying that the Metroid's that

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.340 
not saying that the Metroid's that
weren't<00:02:42.560> released<00:02:42.920> weren't<00:02:43.310> good<00:02:43.520> they're

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
weren't released weren't good they're

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.380 
weren't released weren't good they're
mostly<00:02:45.350> almost<00:02:46.280> every<00:02:46.790> one<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.090> them<00:02:47.240> are

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
mostly almost every one of them are

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.050 
mostly almost every one of them are
amazing<00:02:47.960> but<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.650> did<00:02:48.830> take<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:49.370> long<00:02:49.640> time<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
amazing but it did take a long time to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360 
amazing but it did take a long time to
get<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.420> solid<00:02:50.690> Metroid<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.860> was<00:02:52.010> from<00:02:52.220> a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
get a solid Metroid and it was from a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.880 
get a solid Metroid and it was from a
second<00:02:52.940> party<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.810> general<00:02:54.230> speaking<00:02:54.470> works

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
second party that general speaking works

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.530 
second party that general speaking works
with<00:02:55.100> Nintendo<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> lot<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.850> then<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.390> look

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
with Nintendo a lot and then you look

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.640 
with Nintendo a lot and then you look
over<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.840> sonic<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:58.900> god<00:02:59.900> what's<00:03:00.170> happened<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
over a sonic and god what's happened to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.160 
over a sonic and god what's happened to
him<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.310> guess<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.240> kind<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.990> what

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
him you know I guess that's kind of what

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.260 
him you know I guess that's kind of what
happens<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:04.160> know<00:03:04.250> when<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:04.910> don't<00:03:05.090> have<00:03:05.210> a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
happens you know when you don't have a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.250 
happens you know when you don't have a
proper<00:03:05.630> successor<00:03:06.320> who<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.360> there<00:03:08.360> I'm<00:03:08.780> I'm

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
proper successor who is there I'm I'm

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.470 
proper successor who is there I'm I'm
just<00:03:09.590> using<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.070> as<00:03:10.250> an<00:03:10.490> example<00:03:10.640> though<00:03:11.210> so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
just using it as an example though so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.720 
just using it as an example though so
I'm<00:03:11.930> not<00:03:12.170> sure<00:03:12.380> if<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> person<00:03:13.040> who<00:03:13.190> was

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
I'm not sure if the person who was

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.000 
I'm not sure if the person who was
behind<00:03:13.940> sign<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.750> co-created<00:03:15.380> sonic<00:03:15.710> single

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
behind sign and co-created sonic single

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.770 
behind sign and co-created sonic single
handily<00:03:16.370> died<00:03:16.610> or<00:03:16.820> not<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.150> know<00:03:17.270> that's<00:03:17.690> not

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
handily died or not you know that's not

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.770 
handily died or not you know that's not
what<00:03:18.170> I'm<00:03:18.290> saying<00:03:19.180> but<00:03:20.180> if<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.420> don't<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.750> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
what I'm saying but if you don't have a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.690 
what I'm saying but if you don't have a
successor<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.470> know<00:03:21.590> that's<00:03:22.250> going<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.490> be<00:03:22.580> an

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
successor you know that's going to be an

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.400 
successor you know that's going to be an
issue<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.090> that's<00:03:23.240> why<00:03:23.420> he's<00:03:23.660> still<00:03:23.900> there<00:03:24.080> so

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
issue and that's why he's still there so

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.080 
issue and that's why he's still there so
that<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.700> main<00:03:25.880> reason<00:03:27.070> why<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.100> don't

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
that is the main reason why I don't

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.970 
that is the main reason why I don't
think<00:03:29.450> he<00:03:29.660> should<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.320> position<00:03:30.590> why

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
think he should be in the position why

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.740 
think he should be in the position why
don't<00:03:31.370> think<00:03:31.640> he<00:03:31.820> wants<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.390> be<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.630> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
don't think he wants to be in the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.490 
don't think he wants to be in the
position<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.730> man's<00:03:34.940> already<00:03:35.290> pretty<00:03:36.290> much

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
position the man's already pretty much

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.160 
position the man's already pretty much
second-in-command<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.670> Nintendo<00:03:38.300> I<00:03:38.510> mean

there's another guy there so second I
heard<00:03:41.660> he's<00:03:42.500> high<00:03:42.709> up<00:03:42.739> man<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:43.730> he<00:03:43.970> doesn't

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
heard he's high up man but he doesn't
