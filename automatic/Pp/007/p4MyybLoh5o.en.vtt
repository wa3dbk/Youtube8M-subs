00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 it must have installed the application 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.050
 called busybox that gives access to the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.719
 tools needed 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.180

 recognized by the program and connected to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.910

 start the backup as you can 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.000
 to see at this moment is worth remembering 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.220
 that purple access is necessary and must 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 have the application called busybox as 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 I just informed 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 the device will be connected to the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.590
 to your pc with the fashion decoration activated and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.540
 this way you will have access to the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.369
 program and so will be able to do 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.369
 backup of your email 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 email backup is important for 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.810
 who does some change and does not want to have a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.630
 corrupted email when it happens 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.520
 your device is thus e-mail and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 automatically does not recognize a 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.409
 operator chip and of course no one wants 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.850
 this on the device 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.670
 good, let's wait the program here 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.320
 end the process and have a backup of the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.320
 and successfully saved mail 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.820
 ready the program will be finalized backups 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.220

 backup history if one day 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.000
 You need to put it here and 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.770
 select the file in my case you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.990
 nothing appears, no problem 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.820
 your computer or your device 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.320
 In this case it does not matter, you go. 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.300
 choose between one of the two 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.600
 it will look for the files you already have 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.600
 backed up and will show it to you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.520
 Do you think that you will select all of them? 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.560
 and click history 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 In this case, I will not do it because I do not have 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.000
 need but this is the procedure 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.910
