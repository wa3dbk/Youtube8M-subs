00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.200
 hi and welcome to the other magic one 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.760
 man today released a game requested by us 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.670
 different users so I'm going to 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.520
 list them all now that it's a classic 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.590
 of card magic and tweeting 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.779
 sharp of the professor that is by for 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.800
 this magic use only four 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.839
 cards and the four aces to be precise 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 now of the four axes the more 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.309
 important by tradition is that of 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.499
 spades honestly do not know why it is 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.879
 considered the most important because it is 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.670
 considered the most important 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.769
 there are those who think that the reason lies in 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.449
 fact that it is the only one to bear the name 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.729
 of the cards 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.600
 others think you gave yourself by 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.399
 the fact that the scene has the sign and symbol 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.440
 biggest of all 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.179
 honestly I don't know but in the end who 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 it's me to change traditions 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.780
 so I also keep the ace of spades 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.270
 as a most important leader then 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.460
 you will put because in this game the ace 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.200
 of spades and the most important but in the meantime 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.160
 let's start with the magic a gesture is an ace 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.250
 he turns his face up high in hearts 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.460
 another gesture the ace of hearts yes 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.290
 straighten and turn flowers now is 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.380
 interesting because even if a tool 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.020
 the cards a gesture is another ace yes 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.500
 the framework has always been the problem 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.540
 spades because he is the leader because he wants 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.050
 decide does not want others to ciro 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 not for him 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.280
 and in fact he categorically refuses 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:53.430
 to turn around like everyone else is 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.430
 impossible to criticism turns ever 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.480
 I am a secret no one ace 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.680
 of as long as he is afraid of the dark 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:10.950
 in fact if I put it in the case at 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:15.140
 dark and laugh I turn now so that the lapse 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.140
 of pins turning 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.290
 compared to the other steps this was 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.290
 sad words of dial berlu
