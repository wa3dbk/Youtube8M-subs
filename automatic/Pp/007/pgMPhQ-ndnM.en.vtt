that's good enough well then basically
it's<00:02:56.810> just<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.709> question<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.420> frying<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.599> off

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's just a question of frying it off

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.569 
it's just a question of frying it off
and<00:03:00.109> let<00:03:00.379> it<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.560> sort<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.769> let<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:00.950> stew<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.519> a

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
and let it you sort of let it stew for a

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.069 
and let it you sort of let it stew for a
little<00:03:01.609> while<00:03:01.879> actually<00:03:02.299> just<00:03:02.569> let<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.870> stew

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
little while actually just let it stew

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.170 
little while actually just let it stew

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
so we can put in the all the rest of the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.030 
so we can put in the all the rest of the
ingredients<00:03:05.269> because<00:03:06.109> you're<00:03:06.349> frying<00:03:06.709> it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
ingredients because you're frying it

to be the most important things but it
is<00:04:01.220> about<00:04:01.549> creating<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.269> texture<00:04:02.930> amongst

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
is about creating that texture amongst

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.039 
is about creating that texture amongst
it<00:04:03.410> all<00:04:03.500> fabulous<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.000> let's<00:04:05.209> just<00:04:05.510> look<00:04:05.900> at

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
it all fabulous so let's just look at

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.559 
it all fabulous so let's just look at
that<00:04:06.109> because<00:04:06.859> of<00:04:07.160> our<00:04:07.489> style<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:07.970> cooking<00:04:08.180> is

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
that because of our style of cooking is

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.990 
that because of our style of cooking is
so<00:04:08.900> different<00:04:09.230> from<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.489> rest<00:04:10.669> of<00:04:10.910> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
so different from the rest of the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.759 
so different from the rest of the
islands<00:04:11.480> yeah<00:04:11.660> as<00:04:11.840> we<00:04:11.870> have<00:04:12.139> so<00:04:12.590> many

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
islands yeah as we have so many

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.949 
islands yeah as we have so many
ingredients<00:04:13.160> in<00:04:13.669> one<00:04:13.879> thing<00:04:14.120> you're<00:04:14.629> actually

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
ingredients in one thing you're actually

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.879 
ingredients in one thing you're actually
taking<00:04:15.169> a<00:04:15.530> lot<00:04:15.949> of<00:04:15.980> influence<00:04:16.459> from

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
taking a lot of influence from

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.069 
taking a lot of influence from
different<00:04:17.280> countries<00:04:17.489> right<00:04:18.479> how<00:04:18.599> old<00:04:18.780> income

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
different countries right how old income

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.009 
different countries right how old income
therefore<00:04:19.289> that<00:04:19.859> can<00:04:20.099> be<00:04:20.249> cooked<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.699> about

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
therefore that can be cooked for about

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.839 
therefore that can be cooked for about
15<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.139> 20<00:04:22.409> minutes<00:04:22.439> I<00:04:22.830> want<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.159> show<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.669> off

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
15 to 20 minutes I want to show this off

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.730 
15 to 20 minutes I want to show this off
to<00:04:24.060> everybody<00:04:24.300> now<00:04:24.659> because<00:04:24.990> they<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.319> notice

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to everybody now because they can notice

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.159 
to everybody now because they can notice
how<00:04:25.979> we've<00:04:26.340> taken<00:04:26.610> out<00:04:26.969> as<00:04:27.330> they<00:04:27.509> can<00:04:27.659> see<00:04:27.870> top

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
how we've taken out as they can see top

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.779 
how we've taken out as they can see top
that<00:04:28.620> top<00:04:28.979> just<00:04:29.639> like<00:04:29.729> that<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:30.870> left<00:04:31.379> a

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
that top just like that and left a

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.330 
that top just like that and left a
hollow<00:04:32.789> Center<00:04:33.419> hollow<00:04:33.779> Center<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:34.620> taken

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
hollow Center hollow Center and taken

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.589 
hollow Center hollow Center and taken
off<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.639> rest<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:35.939> the<00:04:36.029> rank<00:04:36.270> from<00:04:36.509> the

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
off the rest of the rank from the

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.929 
off the rest of the rank from the
outside<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.499> that's<00:04:37.800> what<00:04:38.099> you've<00:04:38.249> got<00:04:38.430> cheese

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 
outside so that's what you've got cheese

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.330 
outside so that's what you've got cheese
just<00:04:39.270> like<00:04:39.419> now<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.349> filling<00:04:40.560> no<00:04:41.039> steam

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
just like now the filling no steam

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.219 
just like now the filling no steam
coming<00:04:41.699> from<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:42.029> it's<00:04:42.240> nicely<00:04:42.509> cooled<00:04:42.990> down

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
coming from that it's nicely cooled down

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.409 
coming from that it's nicely cooled down
and<00:04:43.529> we've<00:04:43.949> still<00:04:44.159> got<00:04:44.310> eggs<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.849> add<00:04:44.969> to<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.240> as

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
and we've still got eggs to add to it as

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.239 
and we've still got eggs to add to it as
well<00:04:45.599> that's<00:04:45.900> why<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.199> let<00:04:46.529> it<00:04:46.650> cool<00:04:46.830> down<00:04:47.009> so

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
well that's why you let it cool down so

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.610 
well that's why you let it cool down so
the<00:04:47.430> X<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.849> doesn't<00:04:48.330> come<00:04:48.539> scramble<00:04:49.289> then

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
the X and doesn't come scramble then

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.219 
the X and doesn't come scramble then
right<00:04:50.009> so<00:04:50.639> they<00:04:50.849> will<00:04:51.029> just<00:04:51.060> hold<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.110> together

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
right so they will just hold it together

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.820 
right so they will just hold it together
nice<00:04:52.590> down<00:04:52.889> there<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.840> let's<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.469> break

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
nice down there so let's just break

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.010 
nice down there so let's just break
those<00:04:56.189> into<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:57.300> how<00:04:57.539> many<00:04:57.599> do<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.840> want

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
those into it and how many do you want

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.260 
those into it and how many do you want
to<00:04:58.139> add<00:04:58.259> four<00:04:58.529> in<00:04:58.650> there<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.819> you<00:04:59.879> got<00:05:00.090> that

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
to add four in there so you got that

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.619 
to add four in there so you got that
nice<00:05:00.569> strong<00:05:01.250> texture<00:05:02.250> mixed<00:05:02.849> in<00:05:02.939> mixed<00:05:03.479> in

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
nice strong texture mixed in mixed in

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.890 
nice strong texture mixed in mixed in
everything<00:05:04.409> nicely<00:05:05.189> mixed<00:05:05.939> that's<00:05:06.569> our<00:05:06.810> the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
everything nicely mixed that's our the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.110 
everything nicely mixed that's our the
source<00:05:07.139> consistency<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:08.430> almost<00:05:08.759> looks<00:05:09.029> like

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
source consistency it almost looks like

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.969 
source consistency it almost looks like
a<00:05:09.270> very<00:05:09.569> very<00:05:09.870> tasty<00:05:10.169> bolognese<00:05:10.949> sauce

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
a very very tasty bolognese sauce

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.579 
a very very tasty bolognese sauce
interesting<00:05:14.009> oh<00:05:14.210> that's<00:05:15.210> another<00:05:15.599> another

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:16.589 
interesting oh that's another another

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:17.869 
interesting oh that's another another
way<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:16.919> cooking<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.430> they<00:05:17.550> can<00:05:17.729> make

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
way of cooking and they can make

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.579 
way of cooking and they can make
testable<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.539> nation<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.229> that<00:05:19.379> enough

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:19.589 
testable the nation and is that enough

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:21.800 
testable the nation and is that enough
that's<00:05:20.009> enough<00:05:20.219> so<00:05:20.669> now<00:05:20.879> we<00:05:20.939> just<00:05:21.210> pour<00:05:21.689> it

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
that's enough so now we just pour it

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.079 
that's enough so now we just pour it
into<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.259> case<00:05:22.589> and<00:05:22.889> you're<00:05:23.580> going<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.849> see

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.089 
into the case and you're going to see

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.360 
into the case and you're going to see
now<00:05:24.360> just<00:05:25.169> letting<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.589> drop<00:05:25.830> straight<00:05:26.069> in

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
now just letting that drop straight in

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.450
