00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.420
 welcome we are here now 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.130
 at the lg open house event and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.240
 we really have many 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 products we still apple 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.789
 have to go with as a highlight of course here 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.010
 this 5k tv with 100 5 inches 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.750
 screen diagonal with natural work 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 canton sound what do you think of the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.000
 left and seinfeld and I have to say 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 It's cool, of course, it's huge 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 It is often also it is definitely 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.149
 hermann but not me 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 think harman kardon speaks for itself 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.539
 although the picture is he creates too 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 if you stand that way and I would 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.329
 Of course, that's not what it can do 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.190
 probably meant for home 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 be really expensive but as a study 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 nice device in any case with 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.780
 The stand is something quite new 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 in principle directly in the television 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 integrated with still with this aspect in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.350
 the middle that's cool 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.619
 that's what's very futuristic 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.200
 which is very harmonious in any case 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.869
 cool the picture quality of course 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.909
 still expected a bit more than 4 k 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.909
 which of course only on the on the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.619
 picture relationship is exactly that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.150
 is more pixel but also at the same time 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.350
 much more area so relativized 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.490
 the statement one sees here ex man me 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 I do not know which part I'm not like that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 but that can be a lot 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.090
 what the color faithful school 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.090
 the pictures are done 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.590
 every five days out I would say 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.640
 and there is already a first highlight 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.930
 but we continue 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.490
 more precisely a fancy ips panel 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 would also have relatively perspective city 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.170
 like his little one does not see it though 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.760
 should definitely be accurate and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 we give him a lot and then up 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.330
 but suddenly I do not like the canal 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.530
 commented okay we do otherwise 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.530
 so now you have that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.590
 these shoes 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.520
 I do not know if I'm still heard 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.660
 it's a little bit clean in here 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.130
 is definitely pretty good 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.570
 pretty action-heavy pretty 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.880
 Basslastig as in the cinema actually one 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.770
 bit much for a cinema that 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.240
 perfect for home cinema and great and you 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.820
 must say synonymous of names is that yet 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.400
 Just as we do 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.450
 action-packed fence lush sound i 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.350
 Just watch the soundbar again 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.090
 from man very beautiful it is very much 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.980
 loud I do not know if you do that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.890
 mitbekommt class 5 ktv 125 new 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.480
 ratio once the frame a bit like that 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.890
 so that you can see that from the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.170
 page looks of definitely 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.340
 design technically really chic 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.860
 If the money was there I would have the thing 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.840
 In any case, exactly so people are the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.600
 video that you like compensated 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.020
 subscribed remains high-resolution display 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.020
 and Co
