very important so for Londo we have this

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.370

the<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.090> hair<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.420> not<00:03:08.570> shoot<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.930> yet<00:03:09.200> but

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
the the hair is not shoot there yet but

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.650 
the the hair is not shoot there yet but
it's<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.070> start<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.460> that's<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:11.360> would<00:03:11.510> be

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
it's a start and that's that would be

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.840

the<00:03:11.990> Londo<00:03:12.320> look<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:12.830> think<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:13.070> it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
the Londo look and I think it's it

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.220 
the Londo look and I think it's it
really<00:03:14.030> captures<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.600> essence<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.020> who<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
really captures the essence of who the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.330 
really captures the essence of who the
character<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.890> fans<00:03:16.070> would<00:03:16.220> love

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
because they look like they got stitched

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.720 
because they look like they got stitched
together<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.620> horror<00:03:30.860> movie<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.280> we<00:03:31.580> can

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
together like a horror movie but we can

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.070 
together like a horror movie but we can

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
fix that we can fix it down the road

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
fix that we can fix it down the road
make<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.860> better<00:03:34.300> next<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:35.540> we<00:03:35.750> have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
it just it's it's hat there's a mystery

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.890

here<00:03:43.670> you've<00:03:44.120> noticed<00:03:44.450> for<00:03:44.540> instance<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
here you've noticed for instance the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.800 
here you've noticed for instance the
eyes<00:03:45.020> are<00:03:45.440> kind<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.220> like<00:03:46.400> X's<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.420> that's<00:03:47.690> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
eyes are kind of like X's and that's the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.810 
eyes are kind of like X's and that's the
concept<00:03:48.110> on<00:03:48.290> Galen<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.370> your<00:03:49.580> call

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
concept on Galen this is your call

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
ultimately grey because it's important

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.970 
ultimately grey because it's important
this<00:03:52.640> is<00:03:52.820> Lockley<00:03:53.300> we<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.200> notice<00:03:54.470> the

badges<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.890> think<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.100> agreed<00:03:58.310> no<00:03:58.459> one<00:03:58.550> has

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
badges and I think you agreed no one has

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.630 
badges and I think you agreed no one has
seen<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.300> before<00:04:00.020> so<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.770> with<00:04:01.550> your

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
seen this before so so with your

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.280 
seen this before so so with your
permission<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.060> want<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.540> go<00:04:02.630> ahead<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.900> try

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
permission I want to go ahead and try

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.679 
permission I want to go ahead and try
this<00:04:03.350> on<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:04.010> reshoot<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.030> what<00:04:05.959> do<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.110> think

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.679 

so<00:04:12.689> I<00:04:12.959> think<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.409> silence<00:04:13.889> of<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:15.209> network

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
so I think the silence of the network

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.360 
so I think the silence of the network
and<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.019> studio<00:04:16.199> got<00:04:16.560> representative<00:04:17.220> here

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and the studio got representative here

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.860 
and the studio got representative here
really<00:04:17.940> speaks<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.389> back<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
really speaks this back to the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.420 
really speaks this back to the
confidence<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.350> they<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.949> this

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
confidence that they have in this

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.640 
confidence that they have in this
production<00:04:20.930> he<00:04:21.930> was<00:04:22.079> he<00:04:22.229> was<00:04:22.350> overwhelmed

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
production he was he was overwhelmed

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.760 
production he was he was overwhelmed
obviously<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.520> speechless<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:25.169> think
