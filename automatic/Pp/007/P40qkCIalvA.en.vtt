00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.069
 cut that you do I've got 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.440
 I created 72,000 themed blocks 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.650
 I wanted much less wanted to create 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:36.030
 not even today 60 then do 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:39.780
 I make 160 friends welcome back 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.420
 to ttc tegel from the cdu olympics with 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.309
 the track record games we just had 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.680
 ever the mini admission test role 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 I say where I'm not right 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.050
 The heart built here 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 and g + 10 and we play today 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 here today the discipline becomes art 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.680
 jump and exactly shows how it works 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 So who is running from here on the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:16.439
 system tm about this struck places to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:19.650
 tt correctly remember and complete 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.409
 that shows that right again 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.509
 you run it we said everybody 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.720
 has three tries 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.640
 and there it says so jumped and planned 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.670
 At some point you will hopefully land 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 in the middle has one because of ten 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 score 9.19 in front 10 and on the side 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.860
 9 919 points will be exactly that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 written down and who after three rounds 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 most points has won 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.170
 So yes that's a maximum of 60 points 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.220
 and just right the 96 starts to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.740
 cry 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.369
 I'll say it again, of course, that tnt 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.710
 what I have just destroyed 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.710
 Please, and the next of the ok 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:13.610
 concentrated damn he has one 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.239
 the bullet pushers yes the screams too 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.819
 always so to judo masters then so will 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.799
 I am the master now I am pure 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:36.950
 what is inside you was important 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.950
 with a program with sick and 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.879
 sprint off 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.870
 it focuses and creates there is the 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.609
 is of course a bad of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.810
 I was too bad 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:56.760
 distracted meets horny cool we here 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.769
 good going on and 67 so brilliant stop 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.470
 After all, that can be something 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.090
 yes that you are my very big 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.890
 I think so but I'm just starting 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 as a new sports provider i know 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.370
 not yet, I'm only doing this today 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.670
 rehearsal training exactly we are like 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.730
 conclusion that's just fine 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.730
 out 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.829
 well as far as that happens 96 on 18 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.790
 that does not look bad i believe 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.450
 We will win again here 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.980
 catch up 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 yes I do not know com has us 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.030
 challenged yes but it will be easy 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.680
 is he wanted the industry now fails 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.340
 he still does not have it anyway 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.780
 just about equal duel 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 since I'm decisive in the year 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.169
 follow kg 8 shit and then what is not 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.169
 gone 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.359
 yes, it was still good 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.230
 But that is not distracting 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.019
 so that tnt 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.430
 ok, let's go to the 16 at such a 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.340
 important question where do we move in 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.599
 At first you're okay 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.690
 before it again is because I myself 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.900
 I can be sure that tells me so 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.160
 that's okay at the same time 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.879
 A beam dipped where I could well 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.879
 Yes Euro 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.170
 that was probably here 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.050
 As I write times 20 30 Lost 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.770
 now from so you I do 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.690
 no rain down so good 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.680
 we of course start cottage please how 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.280
 Do you see that on the road again? 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:45.320
 naki why distraction distraction I am 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.010
 against wall arrive nevertheless amazing 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.160
 many points 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.920
 since 16 16 meters 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.880
 yes that is now it is true if this 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.910
 sport for years professional 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.890
 had last everything 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:06.470
 decisive round 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:11.510
 with which I have to engineering times 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:17.000
 comfortable break yes people nice pages 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:21.440
 starter online now but really 29 16 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.180
 16 16 16 I may yes and no 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.080
 I ask you and there I am 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.250
 the technology is 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:36.440
 she is broken what connects us 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.040
 is simply that we have this day 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.040

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:47.800
 all won so that gm is now 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.800
 the technology has broken the delete here 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.990
 I think the web is writing for you 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.520
 I totally destroy them too 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.980
 I really thought I am sleeping here 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.390
 the total source now gained away 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.950
 because we draw on the 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.240
 agree on the whole map and say that is 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.750
 Just again for fun here 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.310

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.330
 I also think difference is one too 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.220
 cool thing the shares yes that makes me 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.030

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.169
 I wanted to create much less not even 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:35.080
 Do not make 60 today then I do 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:39.479
 160 gets a bit backwards 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.479
 The admin will be back later 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:51.130

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.979
 experienced okay okay 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:59.380

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.360
 the scale I would sometimes mean 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.940
 a short time in a row resulted in people that was 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.710
