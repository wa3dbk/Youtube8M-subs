do is head up this like spiral stairs
until<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.299> reach<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> top<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
until you reach the top where you can of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
until you reach the top where you can of
course<00:01:23.100> change<00:01:23.610> too<00:01:23.759> often<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.330> also<00:01:24.509> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
course change too often I but also in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.810 
course change too often I but also in
this<00:01:24.869> area<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> will<00:01:25.650> find<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:26.040> clue<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.610> what

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this area you will find a clue on what

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
this area you will find a clue on what
we<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> course<00:01:28.380> turn<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
we will have to do to of course turn on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
we will have to do to of course turn on
the<00:01:28.890> song<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.090> there

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the song so as you can see right there

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.510 
the song so as you can see right there
on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.540> wall<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.049> says<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.650> soul<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.280> see

on the wall it says a soul can see

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
on the wall it says a soul can see
number<00:01:32.939> three<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.780> basically<00:01:34.200> what<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
number three so basically what that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
number three so basically what that
means<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.579> gonna<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> turn

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
means is that we are gonna have to turn

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.359 
means is that we are gonna have to turn
one<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> those<00:01:36.840> zeros<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> number<00:01:38.130> three

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
one of those zeros into a number three

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
one of those zeros into a number three
in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> bottom<00:01:39.119> over<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.900> you'll<00:01:40.259> also

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
in the bottom over here and you'll also

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
in the bottom over here and you'll also
get<00:01:40.740> another<00:01:41.130> clue<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.909> down<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
get another clue on your way down the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
get another clue on your way down the
spiral<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.079> basically<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.430> right

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
spiral so basically as you can see right

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.940 
spiral so basically as you can see right
about<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:46.380> gonna<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
about now and you're gonna see the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649 
about now and you're gonna see the
number<00:01:47.189> nine<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.610> blue<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:48.149> there<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
number nine in blue right there on the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.569 
number nine in blue right there on the
wall<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> basically<00:01:49.770> means<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.310> we're

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
wall so that basically means that we're

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
wall so that basically means that we're
also<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> include<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> number

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
also going to have to include the number

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
also going to have to include the number
nine<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.710> basically<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.310> gotta<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.579> when

nine so basically all you gotta do when

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
nine so basically all you gotta do when
you<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> bottom<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.140> type<00:01:55.409> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you get to the bottom is just type in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.870 
you get to the bottom is just type in
all<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> those<00:01:55.950> numbers<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.790> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
all of those numbers as you can see you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880 
all of those numbers as you can see you
at<00:01:56.969> their<00:01:57.119> number<00:01:57.390> nine<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.899> right<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
at their number nine and right here and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.230 
at their number nine and right here and
I<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.219> messed<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.759> had<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> all
