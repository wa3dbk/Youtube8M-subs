00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
videos on this subject so I made one

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.650

we'll<00:00:15.780> start<00:00:16.609> with<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> new<00:00:17.910> project

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.910 

single<00:00:21.660> view<00:00:21.840> application<00:00:27.170> will<00:00:28.170> save<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.769> in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
single view application will save it in

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
single view application will save it in
the<00:00:29.699> desktop<00:00:30.150> under<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> name<00:00:32.510> drawing

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

a file objective-c class a uiview job
you<00:01:22.610> then<00:01:23.610> we'll<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.000> into<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> storyboard

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
you then we'll go into the storyboard

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.649 
you then we'll go into the storyboard
select<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.439> view<00:01:29.150> change<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> draw<00:01:30.720> view

select the view change it to draw view

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
select the view change it to draw view
then<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:40.140> view<00:01:40.350> controller<00:01:40.860> dot

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
then we go into the view controller dot

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.249 
then we go into the view controller dot
H<00:01:44.869> okay<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:47.420> go<00:01:48.420> into<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.220> exhilarated<00:01:50.220> view

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
H okay we go into the exhilarated view

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:59.920 
H okay we go into the exhilarated view
jewelry<00:01:52.259> editor<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> we'll<00:01:56.340> add<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> property

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:44.740 

while<00:02:35.010> we're<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.400> we'll<00:02:35.700> add<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.890> property

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:03:01.580 

and<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.590> array<00:02:57.170> it'll<00:02:58.170> go<00:02:58.410> into<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:01.290> draw

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
and this array it'll go into the draw

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:42.710 
and this array it'll go into the draw
view<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:06.800> an<00:03:07.800> array<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> that

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.970 

and<00:03:43.720> we'll<00:03:43.960> go<00:03:44.110> back<00:03:44.350> into<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.800> view

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
and we'll go back into the view

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.780 
and we'll go back into the view
controller<00:03:46.710> and<00:03:47.710> we'll<00:03:47.920> add<00:03:49.050> first<00:03:50.050> off

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
controller and we'll add first off

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:04.230 
controller and we'll add first off
import<00:03:51.790> them<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.900> file<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.730> then<00:04:03.940> we'll<00:04:04.150> go

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
import them the file and then we'll go

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:36.150 
import them the file and then we'll go
down<00:04:04.450> here<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.750> viewdidload<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:34.860> Nick<00:04:35.860> with

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
down here to viewdidload and Nick with

00:04:36.160 --> 00:05:00.219 
down here to viewdidload and Nick with
objects<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.880> we'll<00:04:37.000> add<00:04:37.150> some<00:04:37.360> objects<00:04:37.810> here

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:24.980 

and<00:05:01.229> let's<00:05:01.710> add<00:05:01.919> another<00:05:02.330> array<00:05:23.449> okay<00:05:24.449> then<00:05:24.840> we

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
and let's add another array okay then we

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.230 
and let's add another array okay then we
go<00:05:25.169> over<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:26.250> draw<00:05:26.460> of<00:05:26.490> um<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:30.050> uncomment

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
go over to the draw of um and uncomment

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:45.980 
go over to the draw of um and uncomment
the<00:05:33.319> data<00:05:34.319> draw<00:05:34.830> rect<00:05:35.159> and<00:05:41.870> we'll<00:05:42.870> get<00:05:43.680> up<00:05:44.990> got

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
the data draw rect and we'll get up got

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.159 
the data draw rect and we'll get up got
a<00:05:46.159> block<00:05:47.159> code<00:05:47.639> here<00:05:48.060> all<00:05:48.449> ball<00:05:48.930> saved<00:05:49.289> up<00:05:51.169> so

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
a block code here all ball saved up so

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:03.860 
a block code here all ball saved up so
you<00:05:53.240> avoid<00:05:54.240> me<00:05:54.509> typing<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.270> forget<00:06:03.629> this

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
you avoid me typing and forget this

you avoid me typing and forget this
going<00:06:04.589> here<00:06:04.830> on<00:06:04.860> simulator

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.780 

there<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.680> is<00:06:28.710> while<00:06:29.390> two<00:06:30.390> lines<00:06:30.750> on<00:06:31.610> a<00:06:32.750> graph

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
there it is while two lines on a graph

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.680 
there it is while two lines on a graph
thanks<00:06:35.790> for<00:06:35.970> watching<00:06:36.680> bye
