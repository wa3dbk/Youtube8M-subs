and it didn't work so well my hair drive
back<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.960> seems<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.289> it'd<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.530> better

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
back out this seems like it'd be better

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
back out this seems like it'd be better
for<00:00:52.800> somebody<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.940> relaxer<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.690> well

yeah<00:01:01.130> also<00:01:01.490> once<00:01:02.240> again<00:01:02.300> seems<00:01:02.930> like<00:01:03.050> it'd<00:01:03.170> be

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
yeah also once again seems like it'd be

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.290 
yeah also once again seems like it'd be
better<00:01:03.440> for<00:01:03.560> somebody<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.550> has<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> relaxer

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
better for somebody that has a relaxer

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.210 
better for somebody that has a relaxer
