00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740 
yeah the see that just came from the

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.820 
yeah the see that just came from the
hardware<00:00:06.039> store<00:00:06.100> and<00:00:06.970> I<00:00:07.089> picked<00:00:07.689> up<00:00:08.650> two<00:00:09.030> boats

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830

some put this clutch on this uh predator
Angeles<00:00:14.500> I<00:00:14.679> think<00:00:15.190> it's<00:00:15.339> just<00:00:15.459> like<00:00:15.610> the

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.759 
Angeles I think it's just like the

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.630 
Angeles I think it's just like the
Greyhound<00:00:16.150> engines<00:00:16.539> but<00:00:17.350> on<00:00:17.500> read<00:00:18.490> online

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
Greyhound engines but on read online

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.339 
Greyhound engines but on read online
that<00:00:18.820> it<00:00:19.150> took<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:20.670> 5/16<00:00:21.670> bolt<00:00:22.390> with<00:00:23.019> the<00:00:23.109> number

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
that it took a 5/16 bolt with the number

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.089 
that it took a 5/16 bolt with the number
24<00:00:23.769> 3<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.580> it<00:00:24.699> does<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.619> what<00:00:26.710> I'm<00:00:26.830> trying<00:00:26.949> to

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
24 3 and it does but what I'm trying to

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.599 
24 3 and it does but what I'm trying to
figure<00:00:27.310> out<00:00:27.369> now<00:00:27.580> is<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.779> exact<00:00:29.199> length<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
figure out now is the exact length this

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.000 
figure out now is the exact length this
one's<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.939> three-quarter<00:00:31.539> inch<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.710> one<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:32.980> a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
one's a three-quarter inch this one is a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.130 
one's a three-quarter inch this one is a
half-inch<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:35.050> do<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:36.579> is<00:00:36.760> 5/16<00:00:37.420> on<00:00:37.750> both<00:00:37.930> of

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
half-inch so do with is 5/16 on both of

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.270 
half-inch so do with is 5/16 on both of
them<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.489> thread<00:00:39.850> count<00:00:40.719> three<00:00:41.320> number<00:00:41.680> five

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
them the thread count three number five

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.240 
them the thread count three number five
is<00:00:42.489> twenty<00:00:42.850> four<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:46.949> this<00:00:47.949> one<00:00:48.129> is

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
is twenty four and this one is

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.029 
is twenty four and this one is
three-quarter<00:00:48.760> inch<00:00:48.940> dismiss<00:00:49.390> happens<00:00:50.039> both

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
three-quarter inch dismiss happens both

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.119 
three-quarter inch dismiss happens both
of<00:00:51.219> them<00:00:51.340> fit<00:00:51.579> with<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.980> three-quarter<00:00:53.980> inch

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
of them fit with the three-quarter inch

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.189 
of them fit with the three-quarter inch
I<00:00:54.430> think<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.760> bottoms<00:00:55.120> out<00:00:55.270> right<00:00:55.840> when<00:00:56.079> you

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
I think it bottoms out right when you

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.830 
I think it bottoms out right when you
get<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.730> end<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.030> if<00:00:58.180> you<00:00:58.269> put<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.449> watch<00:00:58.660> on

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
get to the end but if you put a watch on

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.330 
get to the end but if you put a watch on
there<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.230> thickness<00:00:59.559> of<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.829> washer<00:01:00.280> to

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
there the thickness of the washer to

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.790 
there the thickness of the washer to
make<00:01:00.519> up<00:01:00.670> for<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:02.440> sure<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.710> can<00:01:02.890> do<00:01:02.980> this

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.960 

not<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:09.270> paper<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.480> came<00:01:10.660> with<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.760> say<00:01:12.760> it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970
