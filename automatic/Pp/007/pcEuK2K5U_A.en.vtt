00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.109
 the already well-dressed latch equipped with its is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.220
 that's just that 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.100
 that little hint on board 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.340
 the 600 liter v8 under the hood 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.950
 540 horsepower and 630 new to measure from zero to one hundred and four palma five seconds and 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.900
 a top of 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 250 is starting to see 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.860
 we count says 260 or the top 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.070
 suggested leers present 251

 the bell says 320 points actually want to be toni must be able to run 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.300
 it is actually a very strange experience when you are sitting in a car 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.420
 in pull through a series that are known to be limited in most German cars 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.210
 its there it also holds a bit on such two on time to this car with 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.460
 from much harder 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 and i have you who starts it is a jack russel terrier with a whole earth 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.940
 seen our necks past out to here and no further shame 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.510
 it is really crazy this car can drive you 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.660
 on the highway a little traffic 120 is a seven years seven this 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.130
 demand is a large extent 7 bins 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.259
 but good one hundred and twenty is 7 2,000 rpm it is as if you are standing still as well 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.560
 where noise leaks rest a comfortable and then suddenly you get the space 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.740
 and you gas the thing switch back to its 3 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.310
 the actual value hull out 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.469
 the bridge to the right 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.599
 the lord of a sample 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 what a beast 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.209
 this car is really a very special combination of comfortable 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.289
 and very fast and 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.929
 that is not always a successful combination meant often you go anyway 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.779
 so old too distant 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:47.459
 at this one 63 from gft waste united where he can be very quiet and if you 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.669
 really gives it plenty 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.349
 enjoy playing with that car it is an unprecedented good combination of two 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 worlds 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.049
 we are this shoot at a very flexible frankfort stock exchange 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.959
 the sharpness of a m5 bmw m5 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.319
 he doesn't have one 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 on such a long drive this is actually much better 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.019
 I had high expectations for this car 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.719
 have been surpassed 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.489
