00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
doesn't but to let you wet it and the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
doesn't but to let you wet it and the
reason<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:24.000> rigging<00:01:24.390> in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
reason you what it is for rigging in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.020 
reason you what it is for rigging in
this<00:01:25.070> sliding<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.400> weight<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
this sliding the weight right here

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.590 
this sliding the weight right here
through<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.590> nose<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> doesn't<00:01:29.939> rip<00:01:30.119> when

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
through the nose so it doesn't rip when

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080 
through the nose so it doesn't rip when
you<00:01:31.070> put<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> slide<00:01:32.310> through<00:01:32.549> without<00:01:32.790> letting

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you put a slide through without letting

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.249 
you put a slide through without letting
it<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> wet<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.170> won't<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:36.270> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it so when you wet it it won't but this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
it so when you wet it it won't but this
the<00:01:37.560> usual<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.310> Gamakatsu<00:01:38.939> hooks<00:01:39.450> don't

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the usual like Gamakatsu hooks don't

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.730 
the usual like Gamakatsu hooks don't
have<00:01:39.900> them<00:01:40.460> spray<00:01:41.460> paint<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.890> but<00:01:45.740> these

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
have them spray paint on them but these

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.319 
have them spray paint on them but these
look<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.579> nice<00:01:47.700> fun<00:01:47.939> dates<00:01:48.119> I've

believe but if you're gonna use a 3 inch
probably<00:02:26.609> you<00:02:27.209> should<00:02:27.480> use<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.719> 3<00:02:28.439> OTT<00:02:28.590> hook<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
probably you should use a 3 OTT hook the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.879 
probably you should use a 3 OTT hook the
5<00:02:30.329> inch<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:31.189> 6<00:02:32.189> out<00:02:32.400> hook<00:02:32.639> just<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.239> these<00:02:33.569> are

weight<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.829> have<00:02:52.859> on<00:02:53.189> it<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.549> some<00:02:53.700> reason<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
weight you have on it for some reason it

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.670 
weight you have on it for some reason it
doesn't<00:02:54.359> kick<00:02:54.659> as<00:02:54.780> much<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.290> kind<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.530> like

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
doesn't kick as much just kind of like

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.789 
doesn't kick as much just kind of like
mix<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.280> tail<00:02:56.489> kick<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.659> goes<00:02:57.840> deeper<00:02:58.260> but

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
mix the tail kick and it goes deeper but

00:02:58.799 --> 00:02:59.990 
mix the tail kick and it goes deeper but
when<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.159> like<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> lighter<00:02:59.639> weight<00:02:59.849> on

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
it it kicks way too much so I recommend

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.399 
it it kicks way too much so I recommend
just<00:03:06.120> using<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:07.489> quarter<00:03:08.489> ounce<00:03:08.639> hook<00:03:09.409> so

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
just using it with quarter ounce hook so
