00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 There she promised one of the referees 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.330
 hold the economic forum in Bregenz 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.000
 a woman from fashion economy 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.370
 the model business therefore how the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 program of the virtual can take 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 a cosmopolitan creative 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.070
 entrepreneur and passionate 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.140
 family man what can you 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.189
 imagine that she is one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.019
 successful entrepreneur 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 but in the case also family people like 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 can I fall for that? 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.760
 I have already in the lecture already 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 that just really holds the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.170
 transparency that that the children me 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 Faith children love it when their mothers 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.410
 enjoy working and if you have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 can also imagine where the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.000
 mothers work and like to have them always 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.640
 taken along and on the other hand also see 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 the employees and the colleagues like 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.809
 that grow the family and the family 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 grow to see this too is a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.660
 Trust what you give them and that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 will be really respectful too 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 answered and became by me 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.359
 actually never disappoints and makes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.460
 it just holds for me too 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.760
 it was both to have and with each other 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.920
 and to see each other grow 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.060
 now she has laid the crm expo 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.729
 So you have been with the 80s 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.619
 when i get very small with t 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.189
 to produce or develop shirts 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.290
 to design to throw back 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.540
 contrary to the then usual trainer in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 the one with what in the market so 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.750
 was and still is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 made it to an international 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.850
 approved big fashion brand too 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.369
 establish 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.130
 what can you say how much courage 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.500
 needs new as a young woman 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 products to develop new idea and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 then to be as successful as the woman 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 I've just started with some 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 solid component so i have something 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.240
 made what I was convinced that was what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 I was what I defended that I 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.479
 So that's the one that came out of that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.670
 that was me so this this this 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.219
 feminine elements in the styling of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.439
 Business women was something to me something 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.969
 quite natural and such and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.990
 In that sense, I'm just step by step 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.610
 went 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.039
 the company has it not yet 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.900
 developed and i'm sorry i know 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.129
 also the woman mÃ¼ller the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.569
 not at the end just interviewed 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.700
 she would like to have more of the effort 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.689
 and and heard of the torments and and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.549
 maybe sometimes, of course 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.549
 also possible like to show my 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.379
 my gray hair but actually 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.180
 a big one really knows a big one 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.829
 joy and a great fun and i can 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.700
 say that fantastic people 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.230
 have accompanied on the way and yes and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.849
 this is still fun with today 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.590
 making and that the stop evenly and the 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.269
 motor is further for this 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.989
 continue this so this schumacher world 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.220
 to form and enlarge and that 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.810
 Feedback from the customers is just the same 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.639
 just great and that's that's it 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.190
 engine 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.870
 they now no longer have the design 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.269
 they're just always new 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.530
 develop designs and new products 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.840
 They are also new for the new 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.670
 media or both distribution channels too 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.950
 developed and are meanwhile very much 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.189
 successful in the online shop so in 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.139
 Germany will also be in the markets 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.889
 started talking to the British or 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.480
 with an english subsidiary company that plays 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.739
 again your work is due 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.329
 that you are not just on the product 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.010
 want to develop but just 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.169
 sales for including the new take that 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.430
 to have the view 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.109
 this is also true for the new one 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.389
 Try the cinema because it is not 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.590
 so obvious now even 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.060
 not self-evident in the fashion world 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.220
 that these online shops and really 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.459
 work for one for one 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.710
 Modern woman is online at all 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.830
 not to imagine and my customers the 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.990
 they find wonderful saleswomen 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.910
 the areas and a wonderful advice 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.800
 but that's just not trendy 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.840
 for seven is not possible and 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.460
 and then just stop for another 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.200
 time of the customer also to meet 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.310
 then maybe when she's home 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.200
 or maybe she once in the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.720
 moment has where does not feel so good 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.910
 and then online that you online 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.730
 also an equally emotional advice 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.950
 get emotional or as emotional as possible 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.720
 person at an online shop can anyway 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.150
 a fantastic saleswoman 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.590
 One seduces and advises , but we replace 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.540
 that the beautiful is there in this too 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.950
 online shop was online before three 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.050
 years maybe today I believe 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.700
 also much more gear and so would 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.110
 I founded this online shop 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.520
 I come with this idea I need 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.650
 I was clear an online shop 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.870
 now need an online shop and it 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.910
 There were many companies that advised us 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.400
 have and and always have this technique 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.380
 Although always this technology just 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.090
 in the foreground and rationality and man 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.780
 must go to the left and no I want 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.650
 have my online shop emotionally and 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.930
 that's the way we all have it 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.010
 discouraged and and the more discouraged 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.650
 The more is mine 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.720
 contradiction spirit just jumped 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.480
 and I think that would be just like that 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.760
 a technological thing like online like that 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.650
 has reacted to me emotionally 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.050
 of course a lot of friends in the 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.940
 in the specialized press in the end and also 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.320
 just brought in press mode in the press 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.160
 and and also has the customers too 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.340
 fascinates that at all possible 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.880
 is and so is this online shop 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.560
 meanwhile he makes a 1 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.740
 from my total sales and have 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.570
 So wonderful growth rates 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.110
 Growth rates where the deg is not on 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.210
 Beginning 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.890
 now advised to roll and wanted to say 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.930
 that they know exactly how to do it 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.580
 and if only I can do it that way 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.320
 that the potential would be this 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.920
 Potentials have long been 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.770
 exceeded and that feels great 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.210
 Fashion is the very fashion world 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.250
 it is always emotional world again 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.040
 it is very emotional also with the topic 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.280
 connected there is a lot of feeling 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.900
 personally like the commercial 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.310
 partly what exactly the opposite 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.380
 there are times and clear 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.940
 figures are just said that 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.100
 consultants who are then also had then 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.110
 come here it's about rationality there 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.030
 it goes very few become 200 with it 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.950
 The home is in front of the big one 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.750
 circle of economic paths 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.790
 since you can only a few from the 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.770
 fashion industry that you just from bank customers 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.240
 than what really these classic 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.910
 economic commercial 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.560
 areas like they have you can 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.140
 try to these noises to 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.730
 determine that it is very well in 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.910
 this area with this emotionality 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.550
 and they live this in the slow food or 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.920
 I think the brand works for me 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.870
 that the model would have to you 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.420
 business representatives out of it and totally 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.340
 have convinced because a 1 1 business 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.220
 model which men from a wall or 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.600
 one woman show without a working 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.850
 Capital called it 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.170
 in the beginning has developed and then 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.020
 just stop by step really 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.400
 stay with the permanent ones 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.400
 has developed it while it has 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.750
 really from zero to 120 employees 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:57.220
 to own a company building on the 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.200
 shops in Berlin and developed in London 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.600
 that, of course, too 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.770
 but financial partners with banks 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.100
 just always from the 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.440
 own profit and I think that the 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.410
 passion and real feelings and 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.840
 Authenticity a wonderful currency 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:18.910
 and maybe just the ones 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.760
 gentlemen and ladies yes there is faith 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.700
 I meanwhile 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.900
 new currencies and and the customers there 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.900
 outside understand that very well
