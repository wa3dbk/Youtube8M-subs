that way there's no movement at all so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.920 
that way there's no movement at all so
that's<00:02:29.700> update<00:02:30.330> number<00:02:30.780> one<00:02:31.459> but<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.420> second

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
that's update number one but the second

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.960 
that's update number one but the second
update<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.280> since<00:02:35.760> GoPro<00:02:36.510> released<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
update is that since GoPro released the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.259 
update is that since GoPro released the
quick-release<00:02:39.650> tripod<00:02:40.650> mount<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:42.000> use
