00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
strong I don't think that I think

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.700 
strong I don't think that I think
they're<00:05:01.300> like<00:05:01.479> twenty<00:05:01.840> health<00:05:02.020> or<00:05:02.199> even<00:05:02.470> ten

health<00:05:02.949> it's<00:05:03.160> not<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.460> lot<00:05:03.759> so<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.630> can't<00:05:05.169> fight

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
health it's not a lot so you can't fight

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.379 
health it's not a lot so you can't fight
them<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:06.280> as<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.639> saw<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.910> beginning<00:05:07.330> they

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
them but as you saw the beginning they

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.730 
them but as you saw the beginning they
do<00:05:07.509> do<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.660> lot<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.930> damage<00:05:08.139> just<00:05:08.169> like<00:05:08.410> three<00:05:08.650> or

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
do do a lot of damage just like three or

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.490 
do do a lot of damage just like three or
four<00:05:08.770> hearts<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:10.090> they're<00:05:10.360> worth<00:05:10.539> avoiding<00:05:10.900> if

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
four hearts so they're worth avoiding if

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.379 
four hearts so they're worth avoiding if
you<00:05:11.590> can<00:05:11.889> but<00:05:12.220> you<00:05:12.340> can<00:05:12.520> kill<00:05:12.699> them<00:05:12.850> for<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.060> XP

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
you can but you can kill them for the XP

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.430 
you can but you can kill them for the XP
I<00:05:13.539> think<00:05:13.750> they're<00:05:13.840> gonna<00:05:13.930> drop<00:05:14.199> something

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
I think they're gonna drop something

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.189 
I think they're gonna drop something
really<00:05:14.740> cool<00:05:14.919> in<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.430> near<00:05:15.610> future<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
really cool in the near future so the

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.129 
really cool in the near future so the
t-rex<00:05:17.440> is<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:18.360> certain<00:05:19.360> match<00:05:19.539> for<00:05:19.840> these<00:05:19.930> guys

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
t-rex is a certain match for these guys
