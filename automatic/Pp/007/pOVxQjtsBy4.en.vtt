00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.359 
hopefully I won't lose all of my weight
that<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> gained<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.619> am<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> weight

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that I gained because I am at a weight

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.010 
that I gained because I am at a weight
now<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.110> normal<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
now that I like and it's normal so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.600 
now that I like and it's normal so
hopefully<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.170> maintain<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.129> not

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
weight game was kind of quick I guess

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.350

months so I had to buy all new clothes
that<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.680> sucks<00:03:16.920> because<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.790> don't
