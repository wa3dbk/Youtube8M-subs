00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.429 
bit for an hour and how did you do that
Sam<00:01:28.799> Turner<00:01:29.490> moment<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.299> dry<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.840> pop

them into Hessian sacks and store them

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
them into Hessian sacks and store them
in<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.979> shed<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.430> garden<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:38.270> experience

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in a shed in my garden and experience

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
in a shed in my garden and experience
shows<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:40.439> last<00:01:40.680> me<00:01:40.860> through<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.250> about

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
shows that they last me through to about

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670 
shows that they last me through to about
four<00:01:41.579> every<00:01:41.790> March<00:01:42.000> even<00:01:42.299> April<00:01:42.659> next<00:01:42.810> year<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
four every March even April next year so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
four every March even April next year so
that's<00:01:43.799> why<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.159> quite<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.780> important<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that's why it's quite in important that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.350 
that's why it's quite in important that
you<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> decent<00:01:46.860> crop<00:01:47.729> yes<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
you actually get a decent crop yes it
gets<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> through<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> winter<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.530> gets<00:01:49.560> me

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
gets you through the winter it gets me

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.020 
gets you through the winter it gets me
through<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> winter<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
through the winter but I think that the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.460 
through the winter but I think that the
crop<00:01:51.180> I've<00:01:51.329> got<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.689> year<00:01:51.930> I'd<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.079> lucky<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
crop I've got this year I'd be lucky to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.760
