matter<00:00:17.280> of<00:00:17.430> their<00:00:17.670> being<00:00:17.880> good<00:00:18.090> colors<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
matter of their being good colors and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.410 
matter of their being good colors and
bad<00:00:18.690> colors<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.949> matter<00:00:20.099> of<00:00:20.420> groupings

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
bad colors it's a matter of groupings

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
bad colors it's a matter of groupings
and<00:00:21.599> parents<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.170> colors<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.490> thing

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and parents of colors so the first thing

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.480 
and parents of colors so the first thing
I<00:00:23.789> did<00:00:24.000> when<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:24.480> our<00:00:25.369> samples<00:00:26.449> was<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
I did when we got our samples was to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.249 
I did when we got our samples was to
look<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.699> different<00:00:30.390> pairings<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> sort<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
look at different pairings and sort of

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.040 
look at different pairings and sort of
cut<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> rearrange<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.420> color<00:00:33.720> cards

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
cut out and rearrange the color cards

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.900 
cut out and rearrange the color cards
that<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.740> so<00:00:35.250> these<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that we got and so these are some of the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.209 
that we got and so these are some of the
groupings<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.390> made<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.469> ultimately<00:00:37.620> my

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
groupings I made and then ultimately my

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.369 
groupings I made and then ultimately my
choices<00:00:38.520> were<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.480> work<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> worsted

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
choices were to work with the worsted

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.889 
choices were to work with the worsted
weight<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:41.149> these<00:00:42.559> three<00:00:43.559> colors<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.370> um

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
weight in these three colors here um

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.410 
weight in these three colors here um
these<00:00:45.899> two<00:00:46.230> were<00:00:46.770> sort<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.820> safe<00:00:48.090> choices

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
these two were sort of more safe choices

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
these two were sort of more safe choices
for<00:00:48.809> me<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
for me and then this one is a really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.139 
for me and then this one is a really
exciting<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:52.699> addition<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> little

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
exciting I think addition to the little

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
exciting I think addition to the little
family<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.379> chose<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.769> work<00:00:55.890> with

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
family here and I chose to work with

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
family here and I chose to work with
three<00:00:56.250> colors<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.739> that<00:00:58.739> way

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
three colors because I think that way

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
three colors because I think that way
they<00:00:59.280> each<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.539> more

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
they each have a little more

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
they each have a little more
significance<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.590> me<00:01:04.160> my<00:01:05.160> inspiration<00:01:05.850> for

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
significance for me my inspiration for

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
significance for me my inspiration for
this<00:01:06.090> challenge<00:01:06.480> is<00:01:06.870> sort<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> based<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.490> my

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
this challenge is sort of based on my

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240 
this challenge is sort of based on my
first<00:01:08.939> associations<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> a

aesthetics and I think the color
blocking<00:01:36.659> thing<00:01:37.110> works<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.549> she's<00:01:38.850> got

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
blocking thing works with what she's got

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.929 
blocking thing works with what she's got
going<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> knew<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.549> didn't<00:01:41.909> want

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
going on as well so I knew I didn't want

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
going on as well so I knew I didn't want
to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.320> vertical<00:01:43.320> stripes<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.280> horizontal

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to do vertical stripes or horizontal

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
to do vertical stripes or horizontal
stripes<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.780> very<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.710> know

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
stripes because it's very you know

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.840 
stripes because it's very you know
that's<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> time<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:49.850> diagonal

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that's that's all the time and diagonal

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.940 
that's that's all the time and diagonal
stripes<00:01:51.149> even<00:01:51.689> though<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.619> little

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
stripes even though it's just a little

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.760 
stripes even though it's just a little
stripe<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.409> seem<00:01:55.409> somehow

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
stripe that you do this to seem somehow

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
stripe that you do this to seem somehow
much<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:56.610> interesting<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> me<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.570> that's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
much more interesting to me and that's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.740 
much more interesting to me and that's
what<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> ultimately<00:01:58.200> decided<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.750> so

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what I ultimately decided to go with so

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.060 
what I ultimately decided to go with so
working<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.289> worst<00:02:01.469> equate<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
working with the worst equate and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.670 
working with the worst equate and
stockinette<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.960> swatch<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
stockinette this is a little swatch of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.999 
stockinette this is a little swatch of
some<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.399> colors<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.530> what<00:02:07.530> I've<00:02:07.649> done

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
some of these colors and what I've done

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249 
some of these colors and what I've done
and<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.399> I'm<00:02:08.490> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.820> do<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.930> bunch

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and what I'm going to do is make a bunch

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
and what I'm going to do is make a bunch
of<00:02:10.380> smaller<00:02:10.710> pieces<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.580> seeing<00:02:12.210> them

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of smaller pieces and then seeing them

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.320 
of smaller pieces and then seeing them
together<00:02:12.570> but<00:02:13.140> bigger<00:02:13.470> than<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.830> but

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
together but bigger than this but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.540 
together but bigger than this but
because<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.630> think<00:02:16.040> quilting<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.130> something

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
because I think quilting is something

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.360 
because I think quilting is something
that<00:02:18.500> even<00:02:19.500> though<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.740> know<00:02:19.860> that's<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.250> an

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that even though I know that's like an

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.130 
that even though I know that's like an
older<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.090> coming<00:02:21.450> back<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.020> way

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
older think it's coming back in a way

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.630 
older think it's coming back in a way
that<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.380> think<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.710> really<00:02:22.740> interesting<00:02:23.010> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that I think is really interesting and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.060 
that I think is really interesting and
also<00:02:24.180> fits<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:25.140> life<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.710> think<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.920> lot<00:02:26.040> of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
also fits my life and I think a lot of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.680 
also fits my life and I think a lot of
people's<00:02:26.430> life's<00:02:26.670> very<00:02:26.910> well<00:02:27.210> where<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> can

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
people's life's very well where I can

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.020 
people's life's very well where I can
make<00:02:27.870> these<00:02:28.440> small<00:02:29.100> more<00:02:29.400> manageable<00:02:29.430> pieces

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
make these small more manageable pieces

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.440 
make these small more manageable pieces
um<00:02:31.280> when<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:32.370> at<00:02:32.490> work<00:02:32.520> or<00:02:32.970> when<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
um when I'm at work or when I'm on the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.810 
um when I'm at work or when I'm on the
train<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.650> put<00:02:35.400> them<00:02:35.490> all<00:02:35.640> together

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
train and then put them all together

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.650 
train and then put them all together
afterwards<00:02:36.540> um<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.620> didn't<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.790> however<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
afterwards um I didn't like however the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810 
afterwards um I didn't like however the
I<00:02:40.080> didn't<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.620> stocking<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.460> it's

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
I didn't like stocking up for this it's

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.420 
I didn't like stocking up for this it's
it<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.360> too<00:02:42.630> heavy<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.770> worsted<00:02:44.310> weight

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it is too heavy with the worsted weight

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.510 
it is too heavy with the worsted weight
yarn<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.720> doesn't<00:02:46.380> really<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:47.190> kind<00:02:47.460> of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
yarn and it doesn't really it kind of

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.840 
yarn and it doesn't really it kind of
flattens<00:02:48.060> all<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.480> colors<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.820> being

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
flattens all the colors so with it being

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.140 
flattens all the colors so with it being
springtime<00:02:51.720> with<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.170> being<00:02:52.380> nicer<00:02:53.100> out<00:02:53.310> lots

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
springtime with it being nicer out lots

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.210 
springtime with it being nicer out lots
of<00:02:54.360> people<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.780> wearing<00:02:55.080> more<00:02:55.350> sort<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.890> mesh

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
of people are wearing more sort of mesh

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.610 
of people are wearing more sort of mesh
sweaters<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.240> thought<00:02:57.510> hey<00:02:57.810> that's<00:02:58.260> great

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
sweaters so I thought hey that's great

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.520 
sweaters so I thought hey that's great
um<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.850> here's<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.210> mesh<00:03:00.480> pattern<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.080> already

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
um so here's a mesh pattern that already

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.760 
um so here's a mesh pattern that already
kind<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.860> runs<00:03:02.130> on<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> diagonal<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:04.080> by<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.350> on

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
kind of runs on a diagonal so by just on

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.520 
kind of runs on a diagonal so by just on
being<00:03:05.130> strategic<00:03:05.730> about<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.840> yarn<00:03:07.020> overs<00:03:07.350> or

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
being strategic about the yarn overs or

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.310 
being strategic about the yarn overs or
the<00:03:08.210> decrease<00:03:09.210> is<00:03:09.360> always<00:03:09.660> happening<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:10.140> one

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
the decrease is always happening on one

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.430 
the decrease is always happening on one
side<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:11.130> get<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.750> stitches<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.290> go

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
side you can get on the stitches to go

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.740 
side you can get on the stitches to go
on<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.950> diagonal<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.580> make<00:03:14.730> triangles<00:03:15.270> which<00:03:15.540> I

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
on a diagonal and make triangles which I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.840 
on a diagonal and make triangles which I
will<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.080> which<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.070> am<00:03:17.220> then<00:03:17.490> singing

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
will then which I am then singing

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.430 
will then which I am then singing
together<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.780> I've<00:03:18.840> got<00:03:18.960> a<00:03:18.990> couple<00:03:19.230> different

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
together so I've got a couple different

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.510 
together so I've got a couple different
mesh<00:03:20.130> patterns<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.730> I'm<00:03:20.850> playing<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.270> and

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
mesh patterns that I'm playing with and

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.980 
mesh patterns that I'm playing with and
just<00:03:23.520> going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.790> make<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> bunch<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.330> smaller

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
just going to make a bunch of smaller

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.160 
just going to make a bunch of smaller
pieces<00:03:25.290> put<00:03:25.860> them<00:03:26.040> together<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.930> it's<00:03:27.930> going

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
pieces put them together and it's going

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.110 
pieces put them together and it's going
to<00:03:28.260> be<00:03:28.350> great<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.950> those<00:03:29.460> are<00:03:29.610> my<00:03:29.670> color

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
to be great so those are my color

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.080 
to be great so those are my color
choices<00:03:30.420> that's<00:03:30.900> what<00:03:31.080> I'm<00:03:31.170> working<00:03:31.350> on<00:03:31.680> and

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
choices that's what I'm working on and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.760 
choices that's what I'm working on and
I'll<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.600> two<00:03:33.810> weeks<00:03:33.840> when<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.590> is

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
I'll see you in two weeks when this is

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.230 
I'll see you in two weeks when this is
all<00:03:34.920> done

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.300
