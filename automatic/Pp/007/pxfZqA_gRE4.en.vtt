00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
I mean the only thing they're looking at

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.209 
I mean the only thing they're looking at
is<00:01:11.380> for<00:01:11.560> themselves<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.670> know<00:01:13.649> obviously<00:01:14.649> the

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
is for themselves you know obviously the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.209 
is for themselves you know obviously the
et<00:01:15.549> crafts<00:01:15.850> do<00:01:16.030> exist<00:01:17.009> something<00:01:18.009> had<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
et crafts do exist something had to

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.319 
et crafts do exist something had to
build<00:01:18.460> them<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:18.939> there<00:01:19.299> must<00:01:19.509> be<00:01:19.659> aliens<00:01:20.109> and

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
build them so there must be aliens and

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.429 
build them so there must be aliens and
since<00:01:22.329> there<00:01:22.539> are<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.899> crafter<00:01:23.259> there

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
since there are in the crafter there

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.039 
since there are in the crafter there
there<00:01:23.649> must<00:01:23.859> be<00:01:24.100> some<00:01:24.729> sort<00:01:24.969> of<00:01:25.119> factory<00:01:25.390> and

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
there must be some sort of factory and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.249 
there must be some sort of factory and
an<00:01:26.890> entire<00:01:27.189> civilization<00:01:27.700> somewhere<00:01:28.329> and<00:01:28.810> if

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
an entire civilization somewhere and if

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.779 
an entire civilization somewhere and if
in<00:01:29.409> fact<00:01:29.439> that<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.039> true<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.549> apparently

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
in fact that is true and it apparently

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.280 
in fact that is true and it apparently
is<00:01:31.210> then<00:01:32.200> there<00:01:32.380> must<00:01:32.530> be<00:01:33.270> others

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.840 

actual<00:01:37.290> crafts<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.980> technology<00:01:38.550> from

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
actual crafts and technology from

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.590 
actual crafts and technology from
another<00:01:39.090> world<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:41.060> that's<00:01:42.060> probably<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
another world and that's probably the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.730 
another world and that's probably the
most<00:01:42.720> important<00:01:43.290> event<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.650> history

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
most important event in history

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.980 
most important event in history
he<00:01:45.280> kind<00:01:45.520> of<00:01:45.610> moved<00:01:45.880> from<00:01:46.060> science<00:01:46.479> fiction

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
he kind of moved from science fiction

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.300 
he kind of moved from science fiction
into<00:01:47.890> reality<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:49.000> my<00:01:49.240> mind<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:50.409> really<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.070> I

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
into reality in my mind I really just I

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.270 
into reality in my mind I really just I
guess<00:01:51.640> opened<00:01:51.790> my<00:01:52.090> eyes<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.560> big<00:01:53.740> thing<00:01:54.040> is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
guess opened my eyes the big thing is

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.630 
guess opened my eyes the big thing is
whether<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:54.700> not<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.930> can<00:01:56.170> duplicate<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.770> and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
whether or not we can duplicate it and

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.649 
whether or not we can duplicate it and
if<00:01:57.820> we<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.090> understand<00:01:58.630> what<00:01:59.610> a<00:02:00.610> device<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.450> or

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
if we can understand what a device is or

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.570 
if we can understand what a device is or
how<00:02:01.780> something<00:02:02.049> operates<00:02:02.680> or<00:02:03.039> what<00:02:03.430> its

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
how something operates or what its

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.700 
how something operates or what its
physical<00:02:04.210> makeup<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.780> that's<00:02:05.140> great

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
physical makeup is that's great

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.410 
physical makeup is that's great
but<00:02:05.860> if<00:02:05.950> we<00:02:06.070> can't<00:02:06.280> duplicate<00:02:06.789> it<00:02:07.119> it's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
but if we can't duplicate it it's

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.650 
but if we can't duplicate it it's
useless<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.929> us<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:10.420> really<00:02:10.539> two

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
useless to us so there's really two

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.170 
useless to us so there's really two
phases<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.190> project<00:02:12.610> going<00:02:12.730> on<00:02:12.910> there

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
phases to the project going on there

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.640 
phases to the project going on there
it's<00:02:13.269> understanding<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:13.930> we're<00:02:14.200> looking<00:02:14.500> at

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
it's understanding what we're looking at

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.180 
it's understanding what we're looking at
and<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:14.950> once<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.310> understand<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.209> can<00:02:16.599> we

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
and then once we understand it is can we

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.350 
and then once we understand it is can we
duplicate<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.310> with<00:02:18.400> earthly<00:02:18.580> materials<00:02:19.239> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
duplicate it with earthly materials in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.059 
duplicate it with earthly materials in
earthly<00:02:19.540> technology<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.739> know<00:02:20.830> unless

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
earthly technology and you know unless

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.620 
earthly technology and you know unless
we've<00:02:21.280> got<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.459> handle<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.910> both<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.330> them

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
we've got a handle on both of them

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
we've got a handle on both of them
all<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.230> technology<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.920> useless<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.700> us<00:02:24.760> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
all that technology is useless to us and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.289 
all that technology is useless to us and
if<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.860> turns<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.310> can't<00:02:27.549> do<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.880> all<00:02:28.090> we

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
if it turns out we can't do that all we

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.690 
if it turns out we can't do that all we
have<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.690> one<00:02:28.900> single<00:02:29.200> prized<00:02:29.950> possession

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
have is one single prized possession

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.380 
have is one single prized possession
that<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.049> take<00:02:32.200> care<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.390> that's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
that we have to take care of and that's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.960 
that we have to take care of and that's
that<00:02:34.630> after<00:02:35.590> all<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.220> been<00:02:36.370> said<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.910> done

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that after all that's been said and done

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.479 
that after all that's been said and done
would<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.930> do<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.200> over<00:02:38.410> again<00:02:38.530> what<00:02:39.430> would

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
would you do this over again what would

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.600 
would you do this over again what would
you<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.790> differently<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.480> would<00:02:41.410> probably<00:02:41.709> have

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
you do differently I would probably have

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.330 
you do differently I would probably have
played<00:02:43.200> along<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:44.980> longer<00:02:45.400> time<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:47.340> would

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
played along for a longer time I would

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.460 
played along for a longer time I would
like<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.580> have<00:02:49.030> known<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:50.170> bit<00:02:50.290> more

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
like to have known a little bit more

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.550 
like to have known a little bit more
about<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.769> technology<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:52.350> probably<00:02:53.350> kept

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
about the technology and probably kept

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.470 
about the technology and probably kept
quiet<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.820> could<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:57.269> possibly<00:02:58.269> never

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
quiet if I could have and possibly never

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.509 
quiet if I could have and possibly never
have<00:02:58.720> said<00:02:58.930> anything<00:02:59.130> yeah<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:01.950> almost<00:03:02.950> wish<00:03:03.340> I

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
have said anything yeah I almost wish I

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.050 
have said anything yeah I almost wish I
had<00:03:03.640> done<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.180> know<00:03:04.329> it's<00:03:05.079> uh<00:03:06.060> it's

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
had done that you know it's uh it's

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.699 
had done that you know it's uh it's
really<00:03:07.329> only<00:03:07.540> caused<00:03:07.900> headaches<00:03:08.380> and

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
really only caused headaches and

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.150 
really only caused headaches and
problems<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:10.320> believe<00:03:11.320> if<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.739> was<00:03:11.890> given

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
problems but I believe if I was given

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.860 
problems but I believe if I was given
the<00:03:12.190> opportunity<00:03:12.489> again<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.209> go<00:03:13.299> back<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.690> time

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
the opportunity again to go back in time

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.080 
the opportunity again to go back in time
and<00:03:14.049> redo<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.590> think<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.220> pretty<00:03:15.609> much<00:03:15.760> would

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
and redo it I think I pretty much would

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.880 
and redo it I think I pretty much would
have<00:03:16.239> just<00:03:16.450> shut<00:03:16.600> up<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.989> gone<00:03:17.560> along<00:03:17.829> with

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
have just shut up and gone along with

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.120 
have just shut up and gone along with
the<00:03:18.069> program<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.700> would<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.569> much<00:03:19.870> preferred

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
the program I would have much preferred

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.630 
the program I would have much preferred
that<00:03:21.130> instead<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:23.140> Navy<00:03:23.350> or<00:03:24.069> whoever<00:03:24.459> it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
that instead of the Navy or whoever it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.509 
that instead of the Navy or whoever it
was<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:25.359> hand-picked<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.410> few<00:03:26.650> renegade

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
was that hand-picked a few renegade

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.240 
was that hand-picked a few renegade
scientists<00:03:28.510> here<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.780> there<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.799> they<00:03:30.010> turn

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
scientists here and there that they turn

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.390 
scientists here and there that they turn
it<00:03:30.400> over<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:32.380> some<00:03:32.560> more<00:03:32.709> qualified<00:03:33.190> people

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it over to some more qualified people

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.220 
it over to some more qualified people
obviously<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.239> was<00:03:34.450> not<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.720> most<00:03:34.900> qualified

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
obviously I was not the most qualified

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.349 
obviously I was not the most qualified
person<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.889> propulsion<00:03:36.489> or<00:03:36.639> field<00:03:36.850> propulsor

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
person on propulsion or field propulsor

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.090 
person on propulsion or field propulsor
or<00:03:37.450> anything<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.019> sort<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.620> was<00:03:38.799> just<00:03:38.980> some

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
or anything of that sort I was just some

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.860 
or anything of that sort I was just some
guy<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.880> mean<00:03:40.120> they<00:03:40.209> could<00:03:40.389> have<00:03:40.480> picked<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
guy I mean they could have picked I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.360 
guy I mean they could have picked I
could<00:03:41.230> have<00:03:41.319> named<00:03:41.530> ten<00:03:41.859> or<00:03:41.980> twelve<00:03:42.190> other

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
could have named ten or twelve other

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.979 
could have named ten or twelve other
guys<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:42.819> were<00:03:42.940> more<00:03:43.090> qualified<00:03:43.329> than<00:03:43.660> me

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
guys that were more qualified than me

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.300 
guys that were more qualified than me
but<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:47.290> know<00:03:47.410> if<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.650> turned<00:03:47.859> it<00:03:47.980> over<00:03:48.069> to

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
but you know if they turned it over to

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.069 
but you know if they turned it over to
the<00:03:48.430> scientific<00:03:48.940> community<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:49.810> a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the scientific community and not just a

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.039 
the scientific community and not just a
couple<00:03:50.290> guys<00:03:51.060> here<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.239> United<00:03:52.540> States<00:03:52.569> I

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
couple guys here in the United States I

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.229 
couple guys here in the United States I
mean<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:54.040> need<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> large<00:03:54.519> group<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.880> people<00:03:55.000> in

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
mean you need a large group of people in

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.460 
mean you need a large group of people in
a<00:03:55.329> large<00:03:55.570> lab<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.290> research<00:03:56.680> what's<00:03:56.979> going<00:03:57.250> on

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
a large lab to research what's going on

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.920 
a large lab to research what's going on
they're<00:03:57.740> not<00:03:58.490> a<00:03:58.520> little<00:03:58.820> quiet<00:03:59.240> installation

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
they're not a little quiet installation

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.260 
they're not a little quiet installation
it's<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.830> security<00:04:01.670> itself<00:04:03.100> that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
it's the it's the security itself that

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.490 
it's the it's the security itself that
prevents<00:04:05.270> them<00:04:05.420> from<00:04:05.480> getting<00:04:05.750> anywhere<00:04:06.260> I

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
prevents them from getting anywhere I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.650 
prevents them from getting anywhere I
mean<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:07.040> they<00:04:07.490> never<00:04:07.700> do<00:04:07.940> work<00:04:08.180> hand<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.600> hand

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
mean it they never do work hand in hand

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.600 
mean it they never do work hand in hand
you<00:04:09.110> can't<00:04:09.380> have<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> military<00:04:10.580> mind<00:04:12.610> science

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
you can't have a military mind science

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.199 
you can't have a military mind science
itself<00:04:14.350> must<00:04:15.519> communicate<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.670> have<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:17.030> have

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
itself must communicate you have to have

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.960 
itself must communicate you have to have
a<00:04:17.530> free<00:04:18.530> exchange<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:19.100> ideas<00:04:19.280> that's<00:04:19.790> how

that<00:05:00.410> was<00:05:00.590> fantastic<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.030> over<00:05:02.390> but

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
that was fantastic and and it's over but

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.340 
that was fantastic and and it's over but
it's<00:05:03.320> kind<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.620> hard<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.860> shake<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.220> loose<00:05:04.250> but

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
it's kind of hard to shake it loose but

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.190 
it's kind of hard to shake it loose but
eventually<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.380> will<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.890> that'll<00:05:07.430> be<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.580> I

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
eventually I will and that'll be that I

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.390 
eventually I will and that'll be that I
think<00:05:09.200> all<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.500> surveillance<00:05:09.890> and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
think all the surveillance and

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.220 
think all the surveillance and
everything<00:05:11.000> stopped<00:05:11.330> I<00:05:11.690> don't<00:05:12.080> think

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
everything stopped I don't think

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.780 
everything stopped I don't think
anyone's<00:05:12.500> bothering<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.100> monitor<00:05:13.490> me<00:05:13.640> I've

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
anyone's bothering to monitor me I've

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.270 
anyone's bothering to monitor me I've
said<00:05:14.300> everything<00:05:14.570> that<00:05:14.720> I<00:05:14.840> know<00:05:14.960> it's<00:05:15.890> been

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
said everything that I know it's been

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.210 
said everything that I know it's been
all<00:05:16.400> over<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:16.880> place<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.440> it's<00:05:18.440> kind<00:05:18.710> of<00:05:18.830> a

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
all over the place so it's kind of a

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.080 
all over the place so it's kind of a
done<00:05:19.640> deal

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
done deal

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.150

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160

there<00:06:28.379> was<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.560> threat<00:06:28.949> to<00:06:28.979> this<00:06:29.370> world<00:06:29.810> from

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
there was a threat to this world from

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.570 
there was a threat to this world from
some<00:06:31.080> other<00:06:31.409> species<00:06:32.150> from<00:06:33.150> another<00:06:33.449> planet

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
some other species from another planet

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.360 
some other species from another planet
outside<00:06:35.580> in<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.240> universe<00:06:36.860> we'd<00:06:37.860> forget<00:06:38.190> all

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
outside in the universe we'd forget all

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.010 
outside in the universe we'd forget all
the<00:06:38.699> little<00:06:38.880> local<00:06:39.060> differences<00:06:39.720> that<00:06:39.840> we

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
the little local differences that we

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.980 
the little local differences that we
have<00:06:40.289> between<00:06:41.159> our<00:06:41.550> countries<00:06:42.000> and<00:06:42.270> we<00:06:42.810> would

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
have between our countries and we would

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.589 
have between our countries and we would
find<00:06:43.229> out<00:06:43.440> once<00:06:43.889> and<00:06:44.069> for<00:06:44.159> all<00:06:44.310> that<00:06:44.970> we<00:06:45.210> really

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
find out once and for all that we really

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.890 
find out once and for all that we really
are<00:06:45.780> all<00:06:46.669> human<00:06:47.669> beings<00:06:48.000> here<00:06:48.389> on<00:06:48.449> this<00:06:48.720> earth

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
are all human beings here on this earth

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.120 
are all human beings here on this earth
together<00:06:49.610> well<00:06:50.639> I<00:06:51.349> don't<00:06:52.349> suppose<00:06:52.740> we<00:06:52.770> can

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
together well I don't suppose we can

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.460 
together well I don't suppose we can
wait<00:06:53.370> for<00:06:53.639> some<00:06:54.270> alien<00:06:54.750> race<00:06:54.960> to<00:06:55.139> come<00:06:55.319> down

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
wait for some alien race to come down

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.830 
wait for some alien race to come down
and<00:06:55.650> threaten<00:06:55.949> us<00:06:56.120> but<00:06:57.120> I<00:06:57.150> think<00:06:57.539> that<00:06:57.690> between

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
and threaten us but I think that between

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.689 
and threaten us but I think that between
us<00:06:58.169> we<00:06:58.650> can<00:06:58.889> bring<00:06:59.370> about<00:06:59.630> that<00:07:00.630> realization

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
us we can bring about that realization

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.870 
us we can bring about that realization
thank<00:07:02.699> you<00:07:02.849> all<00:07:03.060> god<00:07:03.479> bless<00:07:03.719> you
