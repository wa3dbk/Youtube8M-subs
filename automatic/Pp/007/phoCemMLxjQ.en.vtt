00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hi rain game and tv I'm going today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 do a vlog and why am I doing a vlog 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.410
 it's about the king him hard yo 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 probably seen in title above 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 and that's a very nice thing to explain 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 about the king 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.330
 Be the first to explain what a form 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 Delivery happened that in one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.039
 that and in which a Dutch could speak 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.890
 many do not understand that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.990
 and I'll be able to get this out and a few 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 normally no dutch baby 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 plays a completely different language 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 only i'm to god if it's a store 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.809
 and and god can all understand one sees it 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 in the eyes for me in the shot 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.280
 so everything I see and what I can do 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 and should understand that they are you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 so and that is why you saw with me that is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.850
 Dutch talk and we other that is 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.739
 speak a long language and a whole different language 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 that is just the first instance and me 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.489
 indicate that the one falls on is valid 4 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 more in some that just understood 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.170
 not far found it very strange and two 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.500
 and that is exactly what this vlog is about 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.500
 that is a lot of questions 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.040
 do every week if that doesn't work 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.710
 succeed 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 I can say and you don't think anything 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 man so of course whole and yes that way 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.280
 nice 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.380
 but there is very much a lot of time sitting 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 not only the recordings rule the story 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.880
 devising but also editing costs a lot 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 a lot of time certainly takes four to five hours 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 type of work for a video of four 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.770
 minutes 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.479
 let alone if I make it longer so 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 which anyway does not 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.040
 secondly, it is also true that I am my 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.990
 story as a km mentor I want that there 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.890
 only the important things 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 included 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 so not just a walk around and that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.619
 small does not happen just like that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 a little war my hope worked 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.590
 social eclipse doing nothing what would that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.420
 war 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
 so only really important things like 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 now with empire 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 you really see that in the story 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.820
 from david and everyone will see you 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.030
 that was the same as the clean one 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.400
 against and 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.860
 how often am I against empire as a headline 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.530
 now so that is very important 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 and therefore recording makes one build 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.920
 coma lanner recordings more the something 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 important thing is what i should say 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.220
 in the storyline 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 so say a little earlier to go to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.950
 month maybe 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.560
 and like once more and sometimes once 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.470
 less and that's how it will go on 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.020
 my channel and with climene metals 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.280
 because it's just better my close 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.470
 and then you get important things 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.209
 like the last but you see them why 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.590
 i'm dying how i'm dying i'm going 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.420
 especially 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.760
 and must therefore have become god send 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.709
 very important my brother because god 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.050
 and this is also very important because and 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.630
 actually has just a few 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.640
 their and frame have mountains with entropy 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.440
 had to be finished and then you see that I am whole 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.269
 get angry with each other 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.739
 there will be shame for following you something 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.500
 very different in you maybe a little further 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.330
 over and over with you but that's it 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.720
 We will explain this to you I hope 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.620
 that it is now clearer so especially 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.880
 why not me 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.200
 want to record in every day on every week i 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.480
 hope you do not appreciate and also 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640
 Don't complain about a new one during the day 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.239
 chin the shot if I understand you 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.680
 like it 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.630
 but there are plenty of other things 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.299
 which I also just not on my channel 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.810
 only operation and it never will 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.209
 to become 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.030
 me so i hope you will appreciate then 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.090
 and I hope you are right and a favorite 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.150
