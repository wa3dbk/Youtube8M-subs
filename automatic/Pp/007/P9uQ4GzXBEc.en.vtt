00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
is like a point of perspective so if you

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.500 
is like a point of perspective so if you
are<00:03:27.370> standing<00:03:27.609> in<00:03:27.850> front<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.150> it's<00:03:28.329> gonna

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
are standing in front of it it's gonna

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.080 
are standing in front of it it's gonna
look<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.780> these<00:03:29.260> nut<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.829> shaft<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:30.760> if

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
look like these nut and the shaft but if

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.520 
look like these nut and the shaft but if
you're<00:03:31.269> sending<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.630> side<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.200> probably

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
you're sending to the side it's probably

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.559 
you're sending to the side it's probably
gonna<00:03:32.650> still<00:03:32.980> look<00:03:33.190> like<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.459> but<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.180> mean

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
gonna still look like that but I mean

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.789 
gonna still look like that but I mean
yeah<00:03:34.780> if<00:03:34.900> you're<00:03:34.989> standing<00:03:35.230> from<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.560> back

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
yeah if you're standing from the back

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.949 
yeah if you're standing from the back
side<00:03:35.829> then<00:03:36.400> you'd<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.180> way<00:03:37.510> way<00:03:37.720> far

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
side then you'd have to be way way far

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.390 
side then you'd have to be way way far
back<00:03:38.019> behind<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.530> towers<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.220> then<00:03:39.310> you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
back behind the towers and then you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.470 
back behind the towers and then you
could<00:03:39.519> probably<00:03:39.670> see<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.880> same<00:03:40.120> thing<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.390> was

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480

trying<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.720> look<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:40.989> see<00:03:41.440> if<00:03:41.470> i<00:03:41.650> could<00:03:41.709> get

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920
