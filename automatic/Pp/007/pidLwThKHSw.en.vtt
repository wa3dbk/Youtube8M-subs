a surveillance camera with a TV monitor
the<00:00:18.570> camera<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.080> inexpensive<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> connects

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the camera is inexpensive and connects

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.550 
the camera is inexpensive and connects
to<00:00:20.400> any<00:00:20.550> TV<00:00:21.029> with<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> composite<00:00:21.810> video<00:00:21.930> input<00:00:22.140> a

clear plastic overlay is used to trace

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.640 
clear plastic overlay is used to trace
and<00:00:27.570> represent<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> cutter<00:00:28.529> position<00:00:30.650> when

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and represent the cutter position when

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.319 
and represent the cutter position when
