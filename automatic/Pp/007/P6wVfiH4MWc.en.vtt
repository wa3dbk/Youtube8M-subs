down to ten percent problem we're going

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.120 
down to ten percent problem we're going
to<00:02:29.810> start<00:02:29.870> off<00:02:30.200> everybody<00:02:30.680> with<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.890> hundred

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
to start off everybody with a hundred

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.760 
to start off everybody with a hundred
percent<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.580> we<00:02:31.670> got<00:02:31.760> complicated

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.770 

but<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.460> your<00:02:36.640> chance<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.150> feel<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
but you get your chance to feel the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.200 
but you get your chance to feel the
power<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.200> acceleration<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:39.040> part<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
power and acceleration on part of the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.790 
power and acceleration on part of the
oval<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.600> then<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> course<00:02:41.410> takes<00:02:41.680> you

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
oval and then the course takes you

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.350 
oval and then the course takes you
through<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.070> infield<00:02:42.430> where<00:02:43.090> we've<00:02:43.210> added

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
through the infield where we've added

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.390 
through the infield where we've added
some<00:02:43.480> Road<00:02:43.780> course<00:02:44.050> elements<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.040> really

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
some Road course elements so that really

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
some Road course elements so that really
showcases<00:02:45.610> handling<00:02:46.480> characters<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:47.170> these

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
showcases handling characters of these

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.350 
showcases handling characters of these
cars<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.370> really<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.820> proper<00:02:49.240> way

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
cars and that really is the proper way

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.930 
cars and that really is the proper way
to<00:02:49.390> showcase<00:02:49.690> these<00:02:50.080> type<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.320> cars

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.090 

go<00:02:54.510> out<00:02:54.630> there<00:02:54.840> don't<00:02:55.020> attack<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> course<00:02:55.770> but

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
go out there don't attack the course but

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.890 
go out there don't attack the course but
figure<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.490> all<00:02:56.730> out<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.120> then<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.600> speed

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
figure it all out and then the speed

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.170 
figure it all out and then the speed
build<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.560> from<00:02:58.770> there<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.760> once<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.060> kind

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
build it up from there and once you kind

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.580 
build it up from there and once you kind
of<00:03:00.270> get<00:03:00.390> through<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.690> center<00:03:00.930> section<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.380> kind

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
of get through the center section I kind

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.080 
of get through the center section I kind
of<00:03:01.650> referred<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.130> center<00:03:02.370> section<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.850> big

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
