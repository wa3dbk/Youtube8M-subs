00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 yes hello together today is yes 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.960
 Playstation 4 appeared I had it 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.420
 here she is also represented and me 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.730
 Here she runs just fine 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 at least that's the way it works here 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.400
 output of video and everything works only 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 Unfortunately, the following does not work here 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.779
 killzone and here drive and now 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 can you have a look 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 nothing happens it happens completely and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.980
 nothing at all that so the cd once had 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 assumed shortly, he has now again 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 kicked out directly and takes since then 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.380
 not at all anymore 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.410
 I have had the system once before 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.890
 reinitialized and new again 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 started up and everything but it happens 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.160
 Here nothing more I can 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 a bit try in here too 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 push 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.690
 he does not do anything he makes a blockade 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.110
 the only thing that works is here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 has a button on the drive output 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.239
 to press shortly afterwards then beeps 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 once briefly then he just tries that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.660
 to pick out part of it but apparently 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.030
 Something is broken inside here somehow 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.979
 what that would realize that I'm in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 the cd try to reinzuschieben or 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 yes that's the way it looks 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.490
 but still a few broken the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 playstation on the way playstation 4 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 I hope you are not of it 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 affected if you still ordered one 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 or otherwise i am just such a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.930
 a bit like the ochs in front of the mountain because 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.850
 through the playstation support phone 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.460
 store I do not come through or 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.229
 playstation sport phone hotline komme 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.470
 I have not been through for four hours 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.150
 busy and yes it is great it is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.670
 simply great 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.659
 I can do what I want and it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 it does not do anything different here 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.630
 or else it will and can 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.110
 It is very frustrating the whole thing 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 it works here 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.460
 and I'm not from sony either 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 used to that what was broken time 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640
 it does not deliver from the beginning 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 really works as I said there 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.020
 had read once and then 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 immediately thrown out again and that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.540
 It was just such a little info 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 video I wish you anyway 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.310
 Have a nice day until then
