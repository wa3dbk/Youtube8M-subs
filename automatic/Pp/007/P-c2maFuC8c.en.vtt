 I offer nothing, you cry as a child 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.420
 but you deserve it and endure that pain 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.759
 I just hope you feel what you felt 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.040
 my heart I was not to blame for 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.750
 I was excited but it was my fault 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 for having fallen in love 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920
 I'm not spiteful but I'll do the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.070
 exception and that karma will return everything 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.350

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.840

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 in a scream 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 far away from you I'm going away from you I'll be 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.860
 just to be at peace and no longer go back 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.200
 to see away from you I'm going like that I'll feel 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.780
 better even though I'm not with you anymore 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.700
 will be better and now I get up that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.920
 I was on the ground but I know what to find 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.050
 in someone's arms the consolation no longer 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.360
 I will suffer for someone I will not cry anymore 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 positive optimist and forward I will continue 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.680
 forward to continue in search of love 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.690
 lost is still looking for the love that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.790
 I never had and with me I know that love 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.590

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.930
 happiness thanks to him I'm going to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.240
 find better is that you stay with the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.220
 heart broken because the end is stopped 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.710

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.860
 that you want to be my girlfriend is my 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.050
 repentance and now it is that finally 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.480

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.090

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.070

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.070
 of I love you now says goodbye 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.940

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.590
