00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.529
 hi everyone guys are crazy names 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.380
 today we will see how to insert the lyric 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.070
 sofia the roof in the songs on the iphone or 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.039
 ipod 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.539
 obviously I believe that life the ipod only on 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.340
 ipod touch 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 then itunes will allow us to do 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 this as I will now show you but it is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 a fairly boring procedure indeed 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 you will have to click right on one 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.110
 song whatever get him for gets 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 information shakes because there was in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.579
 Italian and go to the roof to this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 point you will have to insert the text of the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 song or copy it from a site but 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 how can you tell if one has one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.160
 library or want to get the text of a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.649
 whole album as I will show in this 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.730
 driving is a pretty boring job 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.660
 so today we will see exactly how 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 put the text to all the songs 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.640
 together then to do this we will use 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.409
 this fantastic lyric jazz program 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.950
 which unfortunately only works 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.540
 on mac but I'll just find one very much 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.830
 similar or even the same in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.720
 windows version and I will make the video guide 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 also for windows users 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 let's see that it doesn't work 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.600
 we open black cats call is like i 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 present present in this interface 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.540
 in a very simple way we now 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.880
 we will go to itunes to select all 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.299
 songs we want for you 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 the text below him and then holding 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.290
 press the shift key the selections 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.920
 all and I go back all the nam on get 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.180
 lincoln and felsinea murtagh selection 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.290
 will start looking for all the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.670
 songs 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.100
 here is the number of songs 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.159
 selected here is the number of those 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 found and if it is missing if someone 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.180
 say 3d 2d 13 for example to make a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.619
 example 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.380
 ok as you can see it was also 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.250
 fast enough we can close the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.040
 program 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.320
 if we now apologize to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.730
 click on a song with therefore for 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.200
 example we take own black block 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.440
 for example, I would not always take the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.620
 first at that hour of yours until we go 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.850
 applying hay formations is subtext 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.709
 we will find the text and the song 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.930
 now by connecting our iphone the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.810
 travel connected we go to finn 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.630
 the music adds value 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.000
 obviously the album if it isn't already 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.510
 added and click on sync ok 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.850
 perfect 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.660
 after the synchronization we go to 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.660
 see if it worked 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.500
 let's open the nudity application 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.380
 and let's go look for the moon 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.800
 ok now i'll start a song a 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.800
 case 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.420
 and here is the text we can do 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.610
 disappear when we simply want to 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.540
 clicking on the cover image e 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.220
 always make it reappear by clicking 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.290
 well I would say that that's all 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.280
 I recommend you vote and comment hello a 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.280
