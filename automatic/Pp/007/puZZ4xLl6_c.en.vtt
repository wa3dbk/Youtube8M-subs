00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
using 34 that may be because i'm at an

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.470 
using 34 that may be because i'm at an
angle<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:25.160> could<00:02:25.280> use<00:02:25.459> 23<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> lot<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.360> you

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
dot-to-dot symbol there which means go

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.229 
dot-to-dot symbol there which means go
back<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.050> first<00:03:24.200> stop<00:03:27.700> okay<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.120> just
