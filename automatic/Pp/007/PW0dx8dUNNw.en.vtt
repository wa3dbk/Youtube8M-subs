00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.140
 tuning this concept is known practically 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.540
 every driver but today I would like to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.429
 talk not about car tuning 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.950
 and on 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.950
 chip tuning what it is and what it gives 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.170
 nasik the form of work boils hello 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.870
 Andrei stonecrop dose 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.280
 chip they sense the chips they hear all the tuning 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:40.370
 I wanted to talk about this 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 today chip tuning chip tuning more and more 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.360
 This concept is at the hearing and yet what 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.670
 such chip tuning with what it is eaten and 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.100
 how relevant is it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.989
 relevant I think it is always chip tuning 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 chip tuning is a change to the factory 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.500
 engine control unit settings 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.110
 currently all automotive 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.790
 injection engines and diesel engines 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.850
 equipped with control units so 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.560
 called brains chip tuning this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.860
 change factory settings 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.750
 these same brains that give these changes 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 settings 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.960
 people come with different questions 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.840
 regards on chip tuning someone 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 interested in increasing the power of someone 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.170
 speed dynamic elasticity 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.330
 engine controls in all whether 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.920
 cars can do chip tuning for 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.170
 in almost everyone from 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.649
 injector family vazov there 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.490
 let's say take a chevrolet daewoo class 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.399
 there lanos aveo and cars above higher above 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.750
 above again what a person wants 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.880
 do with your auto world for what him 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.000
 need chip tuning or increase power 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.560
 either reduce the flow without say so 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.869
 power loss 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.149
 if earlier to increase the same 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.950
 power we had to intercept 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.640
 mechanical part in the engine now 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.399
 for 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.810
 economy for dynamism us 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.700
 enough to change the software 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.770
 car settings and is it always possible 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.340
 for chip cars s talk about 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.200
 practice 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.609
 but there is a car technically sound and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.030
 According to him there is a suitable program 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.999
 is always 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.399
 how much is a complicated operation after all 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.890
 this is enough control unit 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.990
 they need a special knot in the car 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.430
 attitude to but nothing happened and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.200
 as a driver as an owner I will always 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.540
 worry about what they do with my brain 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.840
 car certainly node is not something that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.540
 say so thin it 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 very not cheap so I have to let on 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.690
 only to those people who have experience 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.599
 which equipment is 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.500
 skills in working with these operations about 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.300
 how is it done 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.800
 chip tuning I think it's worth talking to 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.540
 why our next program 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.540
 that every car owner should 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.220
 understand who he gives the car for 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.349
 chip tuning in order to become 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.360
 really faster and more economical 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.480
 there were no side effects and 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.610
 consequences after such an operation 100
