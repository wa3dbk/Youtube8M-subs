00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
my right eyes which is weird I've never

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.300 
my right eyes which is weird I've never
I<00:01:09.920> didn't<00:01:10.820> know<00:01:10.909> that<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.150> was<00:01:11.360> never<00:01:11.510> told<00:01:11.840> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
I have this is like the biggest mirror
that<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.980> have<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.670> forgot<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.180> mention<00:01:27.300> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that I have so I forgot to mention that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750 
that I have so I forgot to mention that
the<00:01:28.110> glasses<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.620> wearing<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:28.980> are<00:01:29.430> my

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
the glasses I'm wearing right now are my

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.630 
the glasses I'm wearing right now are my
boyfriend's<00:01:30.270> classes<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.050> his<00:01:31.680> vision<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.310> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
boyfriend's classes and his vision is so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
boyfriend's classes and his vision is so
much<00:01:32.940> weaker<00:01:33.300> than<00:01:33.330> mine<00:01:33.660> like<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.530> pretty

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
much weaker than mine like this pretty

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.700 
much weaker than mine like this pretty
much<00:01:34.950> corrects<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.550> vision<00:01:35.880> by<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.180> 1%<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.260> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
much corrects my vision by like 1% so it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.090 
much corrects my vision by like 1% so it
allows<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.550> see<00:01:38.730> from<00:01:39.740> here<00:01:40.740> instead<00:01:41.010> of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
allows me to see from here instead of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.760 
allows me to see from here instead of
here<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:41.940> face<00:01:42.120> so<00:01:42.690> I'm<00:01:43.050> just<00:01:43.380> using<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
here in my face so I'm just using this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.060 
here in my face so I'm just using this
as<00:01:44.060> something<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> give<00:01:45.390> me<00:01:45.420> something<00:01:46.070> clear

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
as something to give me something clear

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.690 
as something to give me something clear
okay<00:01:47.550> so<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.300> my<00:01:48.330> left<00:01:49.020> eye<00:01:49.470> I'm<00:01:50.340> really

sorry<00:01:50.910> if<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.390> any<00:01:51.540> point<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.500> gets

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
sorry if at any point this kind of gets

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.400 
sorry if at any point this kind of gets
blurry<00:01:52.980> because<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.400> really<00:01:53.760> can't<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410

blurry because I really can't see the
screen<00:01:55.770> too<00:01:55.980> well<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.370> I<00:01:56.400> don't<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.120> it's
