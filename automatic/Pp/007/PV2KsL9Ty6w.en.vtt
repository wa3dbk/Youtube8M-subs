00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.180
 guys i'm going to show you what I 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.960
 eat this afternoon I took I'll do a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.179
 marigold with nectarines and pinard and date 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 so I took a kilo of nectarines and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.960
 I thought it was a kilo a little 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.070
 more dangerous on weighed to see and one 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 sell the stones because I have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 kept deposit I had her farm 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.769
 preview 1 kg of nectarines and I have 300 g 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.550
 spinach then are spinach 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.110
 frozen because I had more expenses 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.110
 I will put as I go 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.080
 we must put it in installments 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.480
 takes a lot of volume the reserves 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.480
 plans to leave the naval branch 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.730
 it represents a lot of spinach and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.370
 to have introduced quite a lot to do as well 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.370
 of proteins and iron 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.910
 so it's a meal ready to show 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.910
 nutritious 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.429
 and as the rates are still not 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.579
 are still not very fruitful 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.189
 caloric 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.719
 I add the gym buzz and see 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.270
 what is it why one I said I 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.640
 need it once two small 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.429
 centimeters in one or two dates 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.500
 do no date drama why I do not 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.540
 do not take the real date because I 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.099
 find that it's a bit of luxury in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.299
 France and very really helped dates 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.459
 and cries actually or you 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.700
 register for you to remove the nuclei it 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 there was teeth then voila but me 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.040
 I take the slats bad 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.040
 source ap 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.970
 There you go 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:19.230
 it is a beverage quite to trek 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.920
 and sweet that is delicious just for 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.020
 to say that represents 700 82 calories so 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.630
 this art does not tell us excessively 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.350
 galdric and that represents anyway in 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.980
 iron spiral and 21 grams of 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.980
 Protein frankly and gk and I can not wait 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.350
 in a room ansart it corresponds to 40 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.290
 % dd need vega 3 for example 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.940
 then finally finally function based 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.900
 number of calories to eat or 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.330
 1300 calories a day is really in 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:58.080
 the more delicious it is then I'm going 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:01.410
 will vote for you but that's 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:06.180
 delicious a point but it's really 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.530
 but really delicious because we 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.770
 can be said one spinach but some 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.160
 fresh spinach like that with a hectare 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.170
 innate tsunami it's really finally for 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.760
 try because my luck that 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.480
