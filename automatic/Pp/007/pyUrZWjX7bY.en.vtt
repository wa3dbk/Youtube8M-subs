hot chocolate and another thing we

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.689 
hot chocolate and another thing we
noticed<00:06:58.900> when<00:06:59.080> we<00:06:59.350> were<00:06:59.530> testing<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.460> is

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
noticed when we were testing it is

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.140 
noticed when we were testing it is
people<00:07:01.660> tend<00:07:02.199> to<00:07:02.350> lift<00:07:03.039> it<00:07:03.280> up<00:07:03.460> and<00:07:03.699> and<00:07:03.940> they

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
people tend to lift it up and and they

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.270 
people tend to lift it up and and they
start<00:07:04.419> to<00:07:04.539> bite<00:07:04.780> before<00:07:05.470> the<00:07:05.770> chocolate<00:07:06.160> is

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
start to bite before the chocolate is

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.680 
start to bite before the chocolate is
over<00:07:06.610> so<00:07:07.360> we<00:07:07.570> made<00:07:07.750> it<00:07:07.780> about<00:07:08.080> 30%<00:07:08.919> larger<00:07:09.690> so

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
over so we made it about 30% larger so

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.330 
over so we made it about 30% larger so
these<00:07:10.870> are<00:07:11.110> not<00:07:11.259> actually<00:07:11.740> a<00:07:11.889> regular

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
these are not actually a regular

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.860 
these are not actually a regular
marshmallow<00:07:12.850> but<00:07:13.120> they're<00:07:13.300> actually<00:07:13.479> all

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
marshmallow but they're actually all

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.969 
marshmallow but they're actually all
natural<00:07:14.440> so<00:07:15.009> it's<00:07:15.850> a<00:07:16.120> bit<00:07:16.300> harder<00:07:16.690> to<00:07:17.380> make<00:07:17.590> but

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
natural so it's a bit harder to make but

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.469 
natural so it's a bit harder to make but
there's<00:07:18.190> no<00:07:18.310> artificial<00:07:18.639> flavoring<00:07:19.330> or
