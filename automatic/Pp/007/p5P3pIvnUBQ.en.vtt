00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.150 

well<00:04:34.730> you<00:04:34.850> know<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.770> going<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.040> be<00:04:37.130> a

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
well you know this is going to be a

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.970 
well you know this is going to be a
two-part<00:04:37.640> video<00:04:37.820> instead<00:04:38.390> of<00:04:38.450> one<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:39.800> makes

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
two-part video instead of one that makes

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.310 
two-part video instead of one that makes
way<00:04:40.220> more<00:04:40.250> sense<00:04:43.360> not<00:04:44.360> sense<00:04:44.720> but<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.110> way

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
way more sense not sense but it's way

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.500 
way more sense not sense but it's way
easier<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.460> do<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.820> instead<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.150> cutting

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
easier to do that instead of cutting

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.500 
easier to do that instead of cutting
stuff<00:04:47.840> out<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.950> taking<00:04:49.370> too<00:04:49.550> long<00:04:49.730> for<00:04:50.120> drawing

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
stuff out to taking too long for drawing

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.790 
stuff out to taking too long for drawing
but<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.020> know<00:04:51.910> except<00:04:52.910> I<00:04:53.680> am<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:56.620> didn't<00:04:57.620> think

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
but I know except I am I didn't think

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.720 
but I know except I am I didn't think
this<00:04:58.040> would<00:04:58.190> take<00:04:58.430> this<00:04:58.730> long<00:04:59.350> honestly

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
this would take this long honestly

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.950 
this would take this long honestly
thought<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:01.790> don't<00:05:02.090> take<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.330> look<00:05:02.510> at<00:05:02.630> seven

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960
