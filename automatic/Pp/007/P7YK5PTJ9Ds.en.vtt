00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 gl we are in a bit of a dip we have had lamps that went on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.880
 not very good 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.630
 and now it didn't go well what is your challenge so yes I acted 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.959
 make the jump of five and a half meters on a basket 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.329
 that is called one 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.189
 smart thinking 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.869
 and then certainly 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.470
 smart busy 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.119
 do you know what people think 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.900
 already raided 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.489
 what is that in part the basketball that you 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.569
 Thomas Schoorel has increased considerably 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.380
 backwards the day before 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 theo explain it is out of control it is balanced and adorned 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.290
 we have here 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.910
 we've had this for years 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.670
 it turned out to be a buyer that I see that then I am you then I grab the basket 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.700
 they hardly 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 I'm going on the big trampoline 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.830
 I don't have any spyker it was so it's not a bag of potatoes 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.250
 but it went as high as possible 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.170
 the main part jumps over 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.620
 osn zersel so to get farther so I need my 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.970
 cavities 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.660
 turn mother's distance into 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.050
 vrt 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.210
 singer yes 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.020
 I also no longer discuss the distance between the trampoline and the boss 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.040
 to describe it except 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.930
 meter it is fantastic a centimeter less no and with that 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 so I am very precise there too until the outbreak of things like that 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.049
 you go on this but then you can with that ball if you end up here with you 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.229
 come face to face with it now don't see that do 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.240
 and that will be very difficult but this happens what he must jump so then 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.370
 it still becomes free 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.150
 and this is fantastic when this happens 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.430
 whether this happens ladies and gentlemen a that we see later how it will end that will from 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.230
 make a flow of five and a half meters from mucus at the fairs 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.479
 is it hard 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.399
 who saves 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.419
 I think ambulance is in the air 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:22.489
 and the other when it was fantastic to see a 13 year old boy from Bilthoven 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 let a moment know it knows 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.479
 was arrested again 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.299
 poppy sound from that aggressive japan 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.389
 and it was also used for a long time 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.769
 Johan Nijenhuis would have been there a year earlier 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.239
 the Americans yet 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.689
 i tried the rule that he would rather do it though d 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.170
 Mario in common with a jump of five men I know it's pretty columns because there 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.579
 is that the ball 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.769
 he now concentration 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.309
 yes jump on 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.679
 you get three attempts 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.199
 if something goes wrong once in 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.489
 goes it sometime 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.489
 what do you do to stay that balance 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.389
 gosh what's your name in the building where his movie is big 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:12.009
 year's first hit 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.009
 three attempts and no more no time limit 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.280
 Please do not put your head against things on deck because it is painful 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.279
 do have a good choice for the program 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.659
 peta object with which you go there the first attempt 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.449
 what are you doing 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.449
 to concentrate 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.830
 high eyes throws high eyes hoboken 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.599
 I am not yet 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.059
 handball 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:34.840
 he can stop 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.840
 it would be nice if a challenge once 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.360
 goes a little well 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.490
 if you have a step by step year 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.169
 and we are not finished yet 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.169
 now also on another July 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.779
 then he goes 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.779
 previously drove is behind you 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.919
 as you think 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.040
 what do you say I have not muted an idea great either 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.710
 do that with thinking so look at the repetition not look at how 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.949
 beautiful 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.129
 balkenende she said 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.309
 although 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.309
 holla is good sign 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.720
 do you think i can know this we already have a worn hip 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.050
 no supervision during the training is labor law and I bet I can do it 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:27.400
 points and 200,000 euros a year won a thousand euros you are challenged 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.340
 otherwise it does better than 10,000 euros but does not do this in the blood 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.590
 Have you now five belonged to a confrontation and Nicolette
