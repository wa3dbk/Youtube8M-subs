00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.849
 gonzalo and audi with the a3 not only that 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.710
 let's say he opened the way in a segment that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.150
 it became very competitive but it was 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 reference in all the years that it has been 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.450
 journey of this vehicle lives in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.550
 Argentina marked a very deep footprint 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.110
 for the sales of the brand with this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.239
 renovation that is very complete that 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.829
 it really is deep and in almost all 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.680
 the aspects what are the expectations 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.320
 I say why overcome or deepen 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.030
 a success as fast as this one does not end 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 being so easy is not true if the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 expectations that we have with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.140
 all the history that we say well of the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.609
 three backwards are very high but what 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 most important of all that are to the design 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.109
 but they are real because we know well the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.839
 market that has this car here and this 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.670
 it's a totally new car where the 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.219
 overcoming itself is in the car has 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.359
 a lot of technological elements 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.600
 taken from car of top segments 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.069
 that not only renew the car but that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.140
 they incorporate a lot of technologies 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.350
 new and that we are convinced that it 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.930
 to remain the leader 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 the focus of the segment is urgent 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.810
 ment of Argentina and would like me 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.189
 tell when you said the changes 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.530
 complete not only that they are sold in the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.140
 market but you do me a summary of 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.220
 the most important thing that incorporates in what 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.420
 that has to do with the transformation 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.190
 that you good the car is a new car 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.350
 of its essence when a new car of its 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.750
 essence is that the platform is 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.460
 totally new and incorporates material from 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.979
 new technologies for example in what 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.140
 it's ultra audio that is looking to make the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.509
 lighter car in weight thing that improves 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.360
 the performance the performance of the car and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.190
 other incorporates inside the mmd 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.500
 third generation with a screen that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.619
 retractable inside the center panel of the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.960
 car that is slim fit very light 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.030
 incorporates electro mechanical brake 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.220
 all elements of the segments 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.080
 superiors and also incorporates elements 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.539
 of active and passive security in line 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.229
 assist side assist as to what 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.909
 is technology features for example the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.850
 possibility to equip with the system 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.520
 sound go to light in the audio 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.280
 xenon technologies with led 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.900
 continuous is a totally new car 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.200
 let's say the design of the seats 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.690
 upholstered tires always keeping the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.760
 aesthetic line that characterized the audi 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.380
 a3 and the engines with which 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.110
 Argentines arrive we are 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.850
 bringing this car with three engines or 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.230

 manual version electronic and strong and 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.590
 with traction 4 in this the novelty is that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.650
 we incorporate the attraction to 2 4 to the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.180
