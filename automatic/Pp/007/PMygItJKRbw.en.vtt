00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.129
 Porsche needs special situation we live there and after the 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:04.850
 Player could 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.930
 last season Inter 1 0 in Bochum won either way the jump in 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.869
 the clause made the class 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.249
 and now for free there 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.740
 Werder 13 points as at the same time in the first round already he 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.359
 must be confirmed now 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.529
 "We played e10 24-bit so slowly we should believe it 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.369
 that they really only have a very good team 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.349
 strong on the defensive is that I believe ours so lifted that 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.649
 Confessional confession conceded 31 goals 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.670
 removed 76 very little 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.920
 That too stability and we are simply fire dangerous in the front 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.120
 graduation 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 and just like yesterday's games, the games just still believe in it 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.530
 still must now forced 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.900
 Consumption you demand through the debris poachers luxury 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.840
 this also applies to Freiburg also applies to Mainz for the guests FC Nuremberg 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.420
 at the moment 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.130
 and that's just clubs 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.570
 work very meticulously where the coach 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.770
 Pay attention that theirs even if the sum of the single players may not be 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.140
 Outstanding is a team on the power to bring the place and we 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.670
 Of course what the phenomenon that the usual suspects in the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 Fight for the European Cups almost collective have adopted with 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.010
 Stuttgart Bremen Hamburg Schalke Wolfsburg Seißen great vacuum 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 emerged and clubs like Hannover 96 encountered quite impressive 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.800
 both now there are many little things that make this team look for them 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.220
 the goal of Jan Schlaudraff 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.900
 Pölten the second goal of him must also run from us 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.840
 took him 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.240
 Pölten to the team 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.340
 are all aspects that lead us to a very positive course 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.780
 to have 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.060
 without success 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.939
 that's never the course that's called this start in the Bundesliga 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:37.860
 Great for us 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.120
 the mines important 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.010
 the 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.950
 This happens to every player that he is Solid Victory Column they have been seated 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.590
 but it should not happen and is as good as a solid win 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.200
 Not 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 i know insure the word 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 No intention nominates the brain so what it will pay for 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.450
 So I think there are both parties agree 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.460
 Wissembourg and I hope that no one percent interest 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.840
 the so unforgiving would be the special situation 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.730
 if so 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.170
 We have to be philosophical about the concept of intention 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.230
 The third man on a short break discusses a small problem again 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.199
 September in the house 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.639
 Fischer is over at the World Cup like on drug that it is actually over 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.929
 Questions need a different policy Ulrich Fischer are what values ​​the 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:28.149
 Last days, Oliver James Leape wants to say finally 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.149
 You have to experience that as an association that has to be in front of the windows 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.979
 and we want to experience that with us instead 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.859
 overestimated game itself Hesse and Schleswig-Holstein there was allowed by 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.539
 Moritz said 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:46.389
 that is so that or an unclouded fortune AuM it anyway Europe lie 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.479
 Will be interesting if you do that when you're doing quarterfinals 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.029
 Of course it is clear that we want to go there clearly want our position 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:54.989
 defend 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.470
 Of course we want to show Bayern Munich a game 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.360
 Obviously, the two of us are not that easy 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.619
 defeat now at home so have the arena 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:07.109
 Percent fact is also we have experienced other things in the last song 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.519
 so that we can be courageous on the one hand 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.430
 on the other hand, but very prudent deal with this situation 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.040
 and that I find class that the team had also said year 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.709
 copied 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.889
 Of course, Europe is our goal but they make a stopover 50 points 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.090
 and then it goes on 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.430
 that was a very clear sign that we were there in the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.950
 Has sent out early phase 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.310
 We have not come up with a point that already on Buy and Son 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.310
 Know what we need for we want to win the spiders the incredible 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.360
 Buzz Borussia Dortmund and it is also the mirror of the offer 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.989
 A list of these funds for these fees is of course self-confident 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 we have all success series show 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.180
 we play in full control of the session 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.120
 and it's me playing at winning and then switching fast fast too 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.300
 Großkotz wants to be a fantastic role model for Dortmund as well 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.449
 yesterday 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.339
 to let its players properly from the role of victory both games are live 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.789
 seen all the time 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.079
 but percent 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.909
 this was a player of course also the 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.109
 Quasi a grip because not only defensive but also offensive 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.329
 but that's why the squad must defend as they took on a hit 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.109
 the sprinted he must of course help to close the page under Gross Kreutz 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.500
 that's the mast kilometer that's madness and has a huge quality 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.650
 and show everyone else with his 19 years we can wrap that 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.270
 march 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.070
 from Westerhausen does not matter 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.870
 in Bayern Munich against Hannover 96 but either continued to run as 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.139
 rss 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.590
 but so much in unity that he played last night 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.699
 towards the end 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.400
 Percentages were bills and and bands playing outstanding season 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.259
 and many more captain percent 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.789
 been injured for a long time 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.509
 Drawings are very important for the trophies in that 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.650
 I think there is 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.430
 the overall mood 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.699
 the Team 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.029
 is just sensational and there are coaches already percent 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.789
 a big influence their stories 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.940
 and secondly 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.370
 she poses 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.889
 not a player who was outside the team 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.099
 He did not play but he is much more with the team 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.120
 not only players remained who was 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.050
 and it will continue to be so so next to 60 the leader 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.050
 but have been pushed back 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.189
 that certain structures have changed but sometimes 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.889
 certainly clear because some 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.099
 have brought good performance, the keel I have to do now back first 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.209
 The throat will do what the coach told them to. Rifkin will wait and go 

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:33.819
 and sometimes it is used whether he is perfidious now by the statement namely 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.240
 Islam of the story but I do not think he thought of it 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.949
 Coach said we are not talking about the word anymore he said so himself 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.400
 that's the topic already done in this way by what can one do 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:45.770
 Coach actually 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.850
 At this stage of his career, it is more enjoyable than a club 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.430
 Six years ago, bankruptcy was said to have made this run a training club 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.509
 our state and our fans have probably just medicated dogs to us 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.770
 Bundesliga team within the shortest time is in the Europa League 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.460
 to lead and then to a visit to a league leaders of all time 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.360
 do 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.340
 I think that Jürgen Klopp does not automatically have someone in 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.500
 doppelwandigen and here was always the Bayern trained I think so 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.909
 He does not tick and that would be in view of what is in the Bundesliga 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.229
 for a pretty funny percent, I think the Bayern course for favorite 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.279
 for the favorite 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.680
 per in Hannover but all 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.070
 There's a lot going on so Fred Astaire after the cup defeat 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.560
 against Schalke RAA and it's no coincidence that Louis van Gaal is supposed to be absolutely 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.979
 if today schwergetan faced with his question 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.779
 with the coach was sometimes allowed to ask why a certain player which 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.020
 Position plays 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.259
 Kostal immediately 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.289
 so there is also evidence that he is so that probably even 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.450
 did not feel happy with the question at the latest on 4 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.510
 nine months 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.720
 really the measure of all things they have played a sensational cup final 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.770
 then in the champions league final with Buddy Michaelis of Wolf under reserve 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.790
 Schweinsteiger and and found Bommel that was the strongest FC Bayern percent of 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.949
 recent history leaves us without any need 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.669
 The disappeared Schweinsteiger had to take their form 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.499
 The Michaelis sold out of botnets I've got from Borries 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.249
 me that the Michaelis and when should we yes we have 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:13.759
 and Butt is also sold out 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.819
 No, it has been a problem from the beginning 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.099
 Percent also of fanfare 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:22.759
 the FC Bayern I think without hormones of relatively often missing just 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.240
 Wernig has seen games like Robben win a good third of his games 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.710
 had made 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.840
 It's just a completely different quality of one on the court 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.280
 perhaps almost on par with Messi and Ronaldo as in the 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.030
 e-jugend halt once decide as a situation National Council on 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.979
 Holland and Harwich 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.240
 I've always noticed that people betrayed it 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.550
 and there ignited coach what some march 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.199
 what a shame 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.460
 the first thought that both the interests of all concerned 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.360
 hor 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.589
 they will be Inter Milan first 

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:56.479
 we win the ribbons to go round 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.729
 she will come to the cup final and their cup winner 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:00.419
 this is ManU
