I'd<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:09.300> talk<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.809> simple

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
I'd like to to talk about a simple

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.850 
I'd like to to talk about a simple
feature<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.940> 3ds<00:00:12.330> max<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.679> can

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
feature we have in 3ds max but that can

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860 
feature we have in 3ds max but that can
be<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.490> useful<00:00:14.759> when<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.630> play

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
be really really useful when you play

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.380 
be really really useful when you play
with<00:00:16.170> rendering<00:00:16.710> engine<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.400> when<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.210> need

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
with rendering engine and when you need

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.720 
with rendering engine and when you need
to<00:00:18.420> play<00:00:20.570> maintaining<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> same<00:00:22.730> parameters

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to play maintaining the same parameters

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.099 
to play maintaining the same parameters
for<00:00:24.060> different<00:00:24.570> rendering<00:00:24.990> type<00:00:25.760> inside<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
for different rendering type inside the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.690 
for different rendering type inside the
render<00:00:28.109> setup<00:00:28.760> you<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
render setup you see that we have on the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.180 
render setup you see that we have on the
down<00:00:32.700> haria<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.140> possibility<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
down haria there the possibility to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.020 
down haria there the possibility to
choose<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.140> rendering<00:00:37.140> engine<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.680> if

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
choose the rendering engine there if

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
choose the rendering engine there if
iterative<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.300> production<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> have

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
iterative or production or if you have

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
iterative or production or if you have
to<00:00:41.520> use<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> active<00:00:42.210> shade<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.410> see

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
to use the active shade then you see

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
to use the active shade then you see
that<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> possibly<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.700> use<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.270> camera

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that we have to possibly to use a camera

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.650 
that we have to possibly to use a camera
and<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.410> lock<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.059> useful

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and to lock it and that's really useful

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
and to lock it and that's really useful
so<00:00:48.930> every<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.039> click<00:00:50.430> over<00:00:50.940> render

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
so every time we click over render

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.040 
so every time we click over render
production<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:53.219> render<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> last<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
production to render the last one you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.160 
production to render the last one you
don't<00:00:55.289> need<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.340> which<00:00:57.210> viewport

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
don't need to think about which viewport

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670 
don't need to think about which viewport
is<00:00:58.289> selected<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.180> used<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.750> few

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is selected because it really used a few

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.700 
is selected because it really used a few
youths<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> future<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
youths at there but the future I like to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.149 
youths at there but the future I like to
talk<00:01:04.890> about<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.760> preset<00:01:06.299> channel<00:01:06.869> there

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
talk about is the preset channel there

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.719 
talk about is the preset channel there
and<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.180> let's<00:01:10.729> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and you see that we have let's this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.960 
and you see that we have let's this
window<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.540> bit<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:13.020> lower<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.340> see

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
window a little bit bit lower you see

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.940 
window a little bit bit lower you see
that<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.560> some<00:01:16.560> presets<00:01:17.009> ready<00:01:17.790> done<00:01:18.600> by

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
that we have some presets ready done by

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
that we have some presets ready done by
the<00:01:19.950> outer<00:01:20.220> disk<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.000> talking<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the outer disk and I talking about the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.710 
the outer disk and I talking about the
3ds<00:01:22.110> max<00:01:22.470> scanline<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:24.000> feature<00:01:24.240> there

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
3ds max scanline with some feature there

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
3ds max scanline with some feature there
the<00:01:25.380> lighting<00:01:25.740> allowances<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the lighting allowances and the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
the lighting allowances and the
inventory<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
inventory one you see that we have the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
inventory one you see that we have the
daylight<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:31.100> daylight<00:01:32.100> an<00:01:32.430> idle<00:01:33.210> line<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.840> no

GI and you see that we have also a
preset<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.759> named<00:01:39.229> FFX<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.610> that's<00:01:41.610> me

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
preset and it's named FFX and that's me

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.870 
preset and it's named FFX and that's me
in<00:01:41.880> film<00:01:42.180> facts<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.560> saved<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.700> maintain

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
in film facts and I saved it to maintain

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.830 
in film facts and I saved it to maintain
some<00:01:45.420> presets<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.920> Tim<00:01:47.340> effects<00:01:47.840> render

some presets for some Tim effects render
you<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you see that we have there the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.060 
you see that we have there the
possibility<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.479> load<00:01:51.720> preset<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.799> save

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
possibility to load preset and to save

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.719 
possibility to load preset and to save
preset<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> preset<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.680> contain<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:56.520> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
example final render
okay<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.540> see<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.990> then<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.710> have<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
okay and you see that then we have the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.390 
okay and you see that then we have the
Select<00:02:25.370> preset<00:02:25.970> category<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.980> asking

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Select preset category and it is asking

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.170 
Select preset category and it is asking
to<00:02:28.760> understand<00:02:29.300> what<00:02:29.960> we'd<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.800> save<00:02:31.180> and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
to understand what we'd like to save and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.640 
to understand what we'd like to save and
you<00:02:32.300> see<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.660> there<00:02:32.990> we<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
you see that there we have the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.400 
you see that there we have the
parameters<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.400> we<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.150> common<00:02:35.600> that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
parameters and we have the common that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.640 
parameters and we have the common that
that's<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.930> effects<00:02:39.320> and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
that's this one we have the effects and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.400 
that's this one we have the effects and
the<00:02:39.820> effects<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.090> there<00:02:41.390> inside<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
the effects is there inside the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.350 
the effects is there inside the
rendering<00:02:42.830> environment<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.240> environment

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360 
rendering environment the environment
and<00:02:44.990> we<00:02:45.440> have<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.680> environment<00:02:46.160> they<00:02:46.340> are

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and we have the environment they are

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.550 
and we have the environment they are
inside<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> rendering<00:02:47.270> menu<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:48.140> then<00:02:48.380> we

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
inside the rendering menu and then we

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.490 
inside the rendering menu and then we
have<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.920> rendering<00:02:49.280> elements<00:02:49.730> there<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.080> we

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
have the rendering elements there and we

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.010 
have the rendering elements there and we
have<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> general<00:02:51.920> final<00:02:52.490> render<00:02:52.760> stage<00:02:53.030> one<00:02:53.330> in

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
have a general final render stage one in

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.890 
have a general final render stage one in
the<00:02:54.290> final<00:02:54.830> renders<00:02:55.100> each<00:02:55.280> one<00:02:55.550> we<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.570> say<00:02:56.840> if

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the final renders each one we can say if

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.440 
the final renders each one we can say if
the<00:02:57.170> final<00:02:57.470> render<00:02:57.770> raytracer<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.790> indirect

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the final render raytracer and indirect

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.650 
the final render raytracer and indirect
and<00:02:59.600> illumination<00:03:00.200> stops<00:03:01.420> obviously<00:03:02.420> if<00:03:02.540> you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
and illumination stops obviously if you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.120 
and illumination stops obviously if you
have<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.840> different<00:03:03.260> rendering<00:03:03.680> engine<00:03:03.950> you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
have a different rendering engine you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.760 
have a different rendering engine you
can<00:03:04.310> save<00:03:04.580> different<00:03:05.030> stuffs<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.690> as<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.560> see

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
can save different stuffs and as you see

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.490 
can save different stuffs and as you see
we<00:03:06.950> can<00:03:06.980> obviously<00:03:07.520> just<00:03:08.390> select<00:03:09.290> for<00:03:09.470> example

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
we can obviously just select for example

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.730 
we can obviously just select for example
one<00:03:10.040> or<00:03:10.640> we<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.390> decide<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.110> save<00:03:12.320> just<00:03:12.530> a

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
one or we can decide to save just a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.580 
one or we can decide to save just a
common<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.459> effects<00:03:14.170> environment<00:03:15.170> using<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
common and effects environment using the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.150 
common and effects environment using the
ctrl<00:03:15.980> key<00:03:16.010> or<00:03:16.400> maybe<00:03:17.300> just<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.900> common<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
ctrl key or maybe just a common and the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.520 
ctrl key or maybe just a common and the
final<00:03:19.940> render<00:03:20.209> stage<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.020> it's<00:03:21.230> really

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
final render stage one so it's really

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.520 
final render stage one so it's really
really<00:03:21.860> simple<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.820> useful<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.810> when<00:03:24.380> you

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
really simple and useful and when you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.890 
really simple and useful and when you
like<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:25.220> have<00:03:25.430> all<00:03:25.880> these<00:03:26.150> parameters<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
like to have all these parameters and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500 
like to have all these parameters and
let's<00:03:27.680> think<00:03:27.860> about<00:03:28.070> for<00:03:28.580> example<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:29.209> save

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
let's think about for example to save

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.900 
let's think about for example to save
just<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.680> render<00:03:30.950> elements<00:03:31.070> because<00:03:31.730> for

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
just the render elements because for

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.270 
just the render elements because for
example<00:03:32.270> in<00:03:32.360> this<00:03:32.450> case<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.410> have<00:03:34.160> an

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
example in this case we like to have an

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.140 
example in this case we like to have an
output<00:03:34.730> all<00:03:35.060> those<00:03:35.480> passes<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.410> layers<00:03:37.150> for

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
output all those passes and layers for

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.370 
output all those passes and layers for
an<00:03:38.690> entire<00:03:39.050> set<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.410> shot<00:03:39.890> rendered<00:03:40.610> we'd

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
an entire set of shot rendered we'd

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.680 
an entire set of shot rendered we'd
final<00:03:42.380> render<00:03:42.680> on<00:03:42.830> different<00:03:43.220> scenes<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:44.300> we

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
final render on different scenes so we

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.710 
final render on different scenes so we
can<00:03:44.870> go<00:03:44.959> there<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.470> we<00:03:46.340> can<00:03:46.520> say<00:03:46.790> say<00:03:47.239> preset

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
can go there and we can say say preset

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.400 
can go there and we can say say preset
and<00:03:48.530> we<00:03:48.709> can<00:03:48.950> name<00:03:49.160> final<00:03:49.820> render<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.750> then

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
and we can name final render and then

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.860 
and we can name final render and then
save<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.160> we<00:03:52.340> decide<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.970> add<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.570> your

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
save and we decide to add just your

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.949 
save and we decide to add just your
inner<00:03:54.050> elements<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.709> say<00:03:55.360> ok<00:03:56.360> everything<00:03:56.870> is

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
inner elements and say ok everything is

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.120 
inner elements and say ok everything is
saved<00:03:57.290> inside<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:58.190> one<00:03:58.400> final<00:03:58.850> render<00:03:59.150> and

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
saved inside this one final render and

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.479 
saved inside this one final render and
cancel<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.540> let<00:04:02.540> think<00:04:02.840> about<00:04:03.080> for<00:04:03.410> example

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
cancel and let think about for example

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.750 
cancel and let think about for example
two<00:04:04.900> Lord<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:07.160> change<00:04:07.489> everything<00:04:07.880> cancel

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
two Lord to change everything cancel

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.339 
two Lord to change everything cancel
let's<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.440> for<00:04:12.310> example<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:13.120> scene<00:04:13.930> done

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
let's think to for example a scene done

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.870 
let's think to for example a scene done
using<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:15.250> mental<00:04:16.030> ray<00:04:17.130> okay<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.489> it's

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
using a mental ray okay so it's

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.629 
using a mental ray okay so it's
different<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.169> we<00:04:20.620> remove<00:04:21.609> everything<00:04:22.240> from

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
different and we remove everything from

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.330 
different and we remove everything from
the<00:04:26.400> render<00:04:27.400> elements<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.979> we<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:30.310> a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
the render elements so we have a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.909 
the render elements so we have a
different<00:04:31.000> friending<00:04:31.449> engine<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.020> we<00:04:32.800> have

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
different friending engine and we have

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.730 
different friending engine and we have
different<00:04:33.160> properties<00:04:33.639> there<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.630> we<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:35.620> go

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
different properties there and we can go

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.640 
different properties there and we can go
there<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.160> select<00:04:36.970> final<00:04:37.360> render<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.320> you

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
there and select final render and you

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.430 
there and select final render and you
see<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.400> saying<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:40.180> inside<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.750> we

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
see it is saying that inside that we

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.800 
see it is saying that inside that we
have<00:04:41.560> just<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.010> render<00:04:42.340> elements<00:04:42.460> if<00:04:43.300> we<00:04:43.690> have

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
have just a render elements if we have

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.629 
have just a render elements if we have
more<00:04:44.169> elements<00:04:44.320> we<00:04:44.770> can<00:04:44.949> select<00:04:45.430> which

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
more elements we can select which

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.510 
more elements we can select which
elements<00:04:46.120> we<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.870> import<00:04:47.440> let's<00:04:48.310> say

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
elements we like to import let's say

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.570 
elements we like to import let's say
plot<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:49.960> we<00:04:50.139> go<00:04:50.350> there<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.889> see<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.370> we

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
plot and if we go there you see that we

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.240 
plot and if we go there you see that we
have<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:52.060> old<00:04:52.180> configuration<00:04:53.050> for<00:04:53.380> the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
have the old configuration for the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.840 
have the old configuration for the
preset<00:04:55.740> let's<00:04:56.740> think<00:04:56.919> for<00:04:57.130> example<00:04:57.250> now<00:04:57.789> to

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
preset let's think for example now to

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.070 
preset let's think for example now to
load<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:59.169> different<00:05:00.060> stuffs<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.449> this<00:05:01.840> one

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
load a different stuffs like this one

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.740 
load a different stuffs like this one
scanline<00:05:02.470> radiosity<00:05:03.039> hi<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:04.180> see<00:05:04.389> that<00:05:04.539> we

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
scanline radiosity hi you see that we

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.230 
scanline radiosity hi you see that we
have<00:05:04.900> different<00:05:05.320> stuffs<00:05:05.949> we<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.789> select<00:05:07.120> the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
have different stuffs we can select the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.330 
have different stuffs we can select the
environment<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.900> just<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.039> scanline

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
environment and just the scanline

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.029 
environment and just the scanline
renderer<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.120> load<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.870> see<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.770> we

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
renderer and load and you see that we

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.760 
renderer and load and you see that we
have<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.849> these<00:05:16.180> can<00:05:16.450> I<00:05:16.599> render<00:05:16.990> obviously

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
have now these can I render obviously

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.430 
have now these can I render obviously
because<00:05:18.070> we<00:05:18.250> say<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:19.000> load<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:20.139> scanline

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
because we say we load the scanline

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.980 
because we say we load the scanline
preset<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:21.700> we<00:05:21.880> have<00:05:22.030> all<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.419> other<00:05:22.599> stuff

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
preset and we have all the other stuff

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.129 
preset and we have all the other stuff
set<00:05:23.440> as<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.919> previous<00:05:24.310> one<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:24.849> we<00:05:25.720> have<00:05:25.810> just

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
set as the previous one so we have just

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.379 
set as the previous one so we have just
for<00:05:26.289> example<00:05:26.770> drew<00:05:27.190> tracer<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:28.060> inner

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
for example drew tracer and inner

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.350 
for example drew tracer and inner
environment<00:05:28.539> sees<00:05:29.430> as<00:05:30.430> coming<00:05:30.880> from<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.270> old

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
environment sees as coming from the old

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.570 
environment sees as coming from the old
one<00:05:31.660> if<00:05:32.200> we<00:05:32.470> go<00:05:32.620> for<00:05:32.800> example<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.340> fume

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
one if we go for example in the fume

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.690 
one if we go for example in the fume
effects

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
effects

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.440 
effects
is<00:05:36.480> loading<00:05:38.270> okay

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
is loading okay

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.960 
is loading okay
render<00:05:40.110> elements<00:05:40.200> but<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:41.430> see<00:05:41.640> that<00:05:41.790> we

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
render elements but and you see that we

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.520 
render elements but and you see that we
have<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.240> render<00:05:42.510> elements<00:05:42.630> I<00:05:43.050> prepared<00:05:43.440> for

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
have the render elements I prepared for

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.700 
have the render elements I prepared for
some<00:05:44.520> fumefx<00:05:44.820> scenes<00:05:45.630> you<00:05:45.990> see<00:05:46.020> we<00:05:46.380> add<00:05:46.500> just

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
some fumefx scenes you see we add just

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.460 
some fumefx scenes you see we add just
the<00:05:47.130> Alpha<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.670> fire<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.270> smoke<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:49.320> see

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
the Alpha the fire the smoke and it see

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.660 
the Alpha the fire the smoke and it see
the<00:05:49.590> depth<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:51.230> that's<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.500> way<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:52.740> can<00:05:53.400> use

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
the depth so that's the way you can use

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.080 
the depth so that's the way you can use
the<00:05:54.080> preset<00:05:55.080> you<00:05:55.440> can<00:05:55.470> see<00:05:55.920> even<00:05:56.190> load<00:05:56.580> all<00:05:56.910> the

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
the preset you can see even load all the

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.860 
the preset you can see even load all the
preset<00:05:57.480> you<00:05:57.750> like<00:05:57.990> 12<00:05:58.500> and<00:05:59.420> it's<00:06:00.420> really

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
preset you like 12 and it's really

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.210 
preset you like 12 and it's really
really<00:06:01.200> useful<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:03.080> to<00:06:04.080> have<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.590> possibility

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
really useful to to have the possibility

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.150 
really useful to to have the possibility
to<00:06:05.310> use<00:06:05.550> parameters<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:07.080> configuration<00:06:07.860> for

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
to use parameters and configuration for

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.520 
to use parameters and configuration for
the<00:06:08.430> rendering<00:06:08.730> engine<00:06:09.150> and<00:06:09.270> also<00:06:10.110> for

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
the rendering engine and also for

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.220 
the rendering engine and also for
different<00:06:10.680> rendering<00:06:11.310> engine<00:06:11.670> so<00:06:12.390> you<00:06:13.080> have

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
different rendering engine so you have

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.320 
different rendering engine so you have
not<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:13.650> set<00:06:13.980> manually<00:06:14.550> all<00:06:14.820> the<00:06:15.030> staffs

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
not to set manually all the staffs

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.880 
not to set manually all the staffs
forever<00:06:15.690> time<00:06:16.020> but<00:06:16.380> you<00:06:16.560> have<00:06:16.680> the

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
forever time but you have the

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.870 
forever time but you have the
possibility<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.550> use<00:06:17.730> it<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:19.050> make<00:06:19.230> it<00:06:19.850> to<00:06:20.850> a

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
possibility to use it to make it to a

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.080 
possibility to use it to make it to a
better<00:06:21.570> workflow<00:06:22.220> so<00:06:23.220> for<00:06:23.640> the<00:06:23.730> moment<00:06:23.850> that's

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
better workflow so for the moment that's

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.570 
better workflow so for the moment that's
