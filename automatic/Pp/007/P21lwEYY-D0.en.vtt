results of that let's see how the Nissan

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.320 
results of that let's see how the Nissan
Rogue<00:01:09.869> does<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:11.729> vehicles<00:01:12.030> are

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
Rogue does all of these vehicles are

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.320 
Rogue does all of these vehicles are
traveling<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> same<00:01:13.229> average<00:01:13.470> speed<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
traveling at the same average speed and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.969 
traveling at the same average speed and

while this vehicle hasn't driven off its
line<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.400> much<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.729> previous<00:01:18.150> vehicles<00:01:19.040> it's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
line as much as previous vehicles it's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
line as much as previous vehicles it's
enough<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> affect<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> drivers<00:01:21.479> ability<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
enough to affect the drivers ability to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.880 
enough to affect the drivers ability to
avoid<00:01:22.619> trouble<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.490> returning<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> lane

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
avoid trouble when returning to the lane

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.260 
avoid trouble when returning to the lane
next<00:01:25.890> vehicle<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.610> Ford<00:01:26.909> Escape<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.119> the

next vehicle the Ford Escape this is the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.960 
next vehicle the Ford Escape this is the
worst<00:01:30.540> case<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.990> understeering<00:01:31.710> yet<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.610> also

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
worst case of understeering yet but also

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850 
worst case of understeering yet but also
notice<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> nose<00:01:33.689> dipping<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.320> braking

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
notice the nose dipping from braking

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
notice the nose dipping from braking
that's<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> driver<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.540> system

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that's not the driver that's the system

the<00:01:38.640> driver<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> interest<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the driver in the interest of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
the driver in the interest of
maintaining<00:01:40.259> stability<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.399> doesn't
