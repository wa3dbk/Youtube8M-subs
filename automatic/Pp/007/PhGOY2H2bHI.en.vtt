his<00:00:57.660> stock<00:00:57.989> lives<00:00:58.320> pretty<00:00:58.739> quickly<00:00:59.129> because

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
his stock lives pretty quickly because

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
his stock lives pretty quickly because
of<00:01:00.000> his<00:01:00.090> small<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.750> light<00:01:01.079> frame<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.980> makes

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
of his small and light frame this makes

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
of his small and light frame this makes
it<00:01:02.430> easy<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.940> bigger<00:01:03.149> enemies<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.809> knock<00:01:04.019> him

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it easy for bigger enemies to knock him

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.770 
it easy for bigger enemies to knock him
back<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> make<00:01:05.010> him<00:01:05.280> fall<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.060> screen

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
back and to make him fall off the screen

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
back and to make him fall off the screen
but<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.650> me<00:01:07.710> thinking<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.549> far<00:01:08.909> would

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
but that got me thinking how far would

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
but that got me thinking how far would
Mario<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.930> fall<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.380> him<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.710> actually

fall<00:01:38.939> about<00:01:39.360> 20<00:01:39.810> feet<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.890> think

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
fall about 20 feet and you would think

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039 
fall about 20 feet and you would think
that<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.460> super<00:01:41.880> hero<00:01:42.060> would<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.659> able<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that a super hero would be able to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
that a super hero would be able to
survive<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.470> 20-foot<00:01:44.280> fall<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.180> mean

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
survive a 20-foot fall right I mean

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.539 
survive a 20-foot fall right I mean
that's<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.140> falling<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.070> top<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.460> a

that's like falling from the top of a
giraffe<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.600> even<00:01:49.200> humans<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.979> survive

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
