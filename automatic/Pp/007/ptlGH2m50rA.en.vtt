00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.309 

welcome<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.460> experiment<00:00:02.939> into<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.929> idea

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
welcome to this experiment into the idea

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.940 
welcome to this experiment into the idea
that<00:00:05.480> crystals<00:00:06.480> can<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.350> an<00:00:07.440> impact<00:00:07.770> on

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
that crystals can have an impact on

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.810 
that crystals can have an impact on
biological<00:00:08.730> organisms<00:00:10.400> basically<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:11.639> I've

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
biological organisms basically what I've

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.419 
biological organisms basically what I've
done<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.660> experiment<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.769> test<00:00:14.309> this

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
done in this experiment is to test this

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.630 
done in this experiment is to test this
idea<00:00:14.639> by<00:00:15.030> uh<00:00:15.059> plants<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> what<00:00:17.100> I've<00:00:17.220> done<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
idea by uh plants so what I've done is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.330 
idea by uh plants so what I've done is
is<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> put<00:00:18.210> thirty<00:00:18.600> water<00:00:19.050> cress<00:00:19.350> seeds<00:00:19.590> into

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
is to put thirty water cress seeds into

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.830 
is to put thirty water cress seeds into
each<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.630> these<00:00:21.779> eight<00:00:22.170> pots<00:00:22.670> I've<00:00:23.670> also<00:00:23.850> put<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
each of these eight pots I've also put a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
each of these eight pots I've also put a
rose<00:00:25.320> quartz<00:00:25.680> crystal<00:00:26.279> which<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.029> claimed<00:00:27.449> by

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
rose quartz crystal which is claimed by

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.320 
rose quartz crystal which is claimed by
many<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> healing<00:00:28.529> crystal<00:00:29.070> into<00:00:30.029> each

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
many to be a healing crystal into each

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
many to be a healing crystal into each
of<00:00:30.539> these<00:00:30.689> four<00:00:31.080> pots<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.679> I've<00:00:32.340> left<00:00:32.579> these

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
of these four pots and I've left these

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.569 
of these four pots and I've left these
four<00:00:33.149> pots<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.570> control<00:00:33.989> pots<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.460> I'm

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
four pots as control pots so what I'm

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
four pots as control pots so what I'm
going<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.420> compare<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.530> amount<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
going to do is compare the amount of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.990 
going to do is compare the amount of
plant<00:00:38.940> growth<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:40.230> pots

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
plant growth in these pots

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.240 
plant growth in these pots
compared<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> these<00:00:42.600> pots<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.649> give<00:00:44.010> me<00:00:44.160> about

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
compared to these pots and give me about

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.220 
compared to these pots and give me about
this<00:00:45.030> experimental<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.590> one

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
this experimental is that because one

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.189 
this experimental is that because one
quite<00:00:49.230> quickly<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.120> I'm<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.300> give<00:00:51.629> roughly

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
quite quickly so I'm gonna give roughly

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
quite quickly so I'm gonna give roughly
the<00:00:52.289> same<00:00:52.469> amount<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.860> water<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.699> every<00:00:54.300> single

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the same amount of water to every single

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.110 
the same amount of water to every single
pot<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.789> after<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:57.329> four<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.530> five<00:00:58.739> days

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
pot and after about four or five days

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.770 
pot and after about four or five days
I'm<00:01:00.120> gonna<00:01:00.390> look<00:01:00.570> -<00:01:02.270> yeah<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.600> what's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I'm gonna look - yeah see what's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
I'm gonna look - yeah see what's
happened<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.010> also<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> be

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
happened really but I'm also going to be

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.840 
happened really but I'm also going to be
looking<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> day-to-day<00:01:06.360> basis<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:09.020> see<00:01:10.850> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
looking on a day-to-day basis to see you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.130 
looking on a day-to-day basis to see you
know<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> progress<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.580> yes<00:01:14.580> that's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
know what the progress is yes that's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
know what the progress is yes that's
everything<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
everything for now I just like to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
everything for now I just like to
quickly<00:01:18.180> say<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.960> except<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.009> isn't<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
quickly say that except this isn't a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.310 
quickly say that except this isn't a
laboratory

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
laboratory

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.249 
laboratory
except<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.619> completely<00:01:23.189> control<00:01:24.259> I've

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
except it's not completely control I've

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.789 
except it's not completely control I've
made<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.799> basics<00:01:26.430> grounds<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> same

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
made all the basics grounds of the same

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.749 
made all the basics grounds of the same
so<00:01:28.799> please<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.780> claim<00:01:31.759> or

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so please don't take this as a claim or

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.640 
so please don't take this as a claim or
whatever<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> results<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:33.750> bones<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
whatever the results of these bones a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.520 
whatever the results of these bones a
claim<00:01:35.340> either<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
claim either way that you know it's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.679 
claim either way that you know it's
better<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.310> evidence<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.479> thought

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
better than evidence but I just thought

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.940 
better than evidence but I just thought
it<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.110> an<00:01:40.320> interesting<00:01:40.619> experiment

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
it would be an interesting experiment

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.649 
it would be an interesting experiment
okay<00:01:43.950> yeah<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
okay yeah that's all for now so this is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.429 
okay yeah that's all for now so this is
day<00:01:45.960> one<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> I'll<00:01:46.890> report<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.439> tomorrow

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
day one and I'll report back on tomorrow

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.179 
day one and I'll report back on tomorrow
day<00:01:49.770> two<00:01:49.829> about<00:01:50.579> progress<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.750> experiment

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.109 

day<00:01:55.759> two<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.450> experiment<00:01:57.170> into<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.729> idea

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
day two of this experiment into the idea

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.440 
day two of this experiment into the idea
that<00:01:59.380> crystals<00:02:00.380> can<00:02:00.939> positively<00:02:01.939> interact

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
that crystals can positively interact

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.730 
that crystals can positively interact
with<00:02:03.049> other<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.590> organism

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
with other to organism

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.370 
with other to organism
again<00:02:06.740> these<00:02:07.310> are<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.670> pots<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.599> rose

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
again these are the pots with rose

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.880 
again these are the pots with rose
quartz<00:02:09.739> in<00:02:10.330> these<00:02:11.330> are<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> pots<00:02:12.080> with<00:02:12.440> no

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
quartz in these are the pots with no

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.839 
quartz in these are the pots with no
rose<00:02:13.130> gold<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.420> they<00:02:14.599> do<00:02:14.660> no<00:02:15.170> progress

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
rose gold and they do no progress

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.520 
rose gold and they do no progress
economy<00:02:16.849> green<00:02:17.030> growth<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:18.140> I'm<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
economy green growth so I'm going to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.860 
economy green growth so I'm going to
wait<00:02:18.650> from<00:02:18.890> tomorrow<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.760> if<00:02:20.120> anything

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
wait from tomorrow to see if anything

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.130 
wait from tomorrow to see if anything
has<00:02:21.170> happened

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
has happened

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.520 
has happened
day<00:02:24.140> three<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.830> experiment<00:02:26.319> still<00:02:27.319> not

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
day three of this experiment still not

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.880 
day three of this experiment still not
much<00:02:27.709> progress<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.549> bit<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.390> germination<00:02:30.319> going

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
much progress a bit of germination going

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.229 
much progress a bit of germination going
on<00:02:31.099> in<00:02:31.940> all<00:02:32.120> pots<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:33.700> nothing<00:02:34.700> else<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.060> say

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
on in all pots but nothing else to say

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.740 
on in all pots but nothing else to say
really<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:35.860> going<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.980> see<00:02:37.190> what<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:37.549> like

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
really so going to see what it's like

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.930 
really so going to see what it's like
tomorrow<00:02:38.830> hopefully<00:02:39.830> they'll<00:02:40.190> be<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> bit<00:02:40.730> more

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
tomorrow hopefully they'll be a bit more

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.640 
tomorrow hopefully they'll be a bit more
growth<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.630> fourth<00:02:45.080> day<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.319> the

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
experiment there is now some green

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.759 
experiment there is now some green

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
growth in all of the pots but as of yet

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.420

experiment into whether razor courts in

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.660 
experiment into whether razor courts in
effect<00:03:01.280> sparked<00:03:01.640> growth<00:03:02.709> there's<00:03:03.709> good<00:03:03.950> plant

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
effect sparked growth there's good plant

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.150 
effect sparked growth there's good plant
growth<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.090> all<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.420> pots<00:03:05.630> now<00:03:06.069> apart<00:03:07.069> from

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
growth in all of the pots now apart from

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.190 
growth in all of the pots now apart from
this<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:07.640> which<00:03:08.299> seems<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.049> gone<00:03:09.140> wrong

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
this one which seems to have gone wrong

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.080 
this one which seems to have gone wrong
in<00:03:09.410> some<00:03:09.739> way<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:09.950> we're<00:03:10.400> discount<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.850> you

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
in some way so we're discount it as you

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.199 
in some way so we're discount it as you
get<00:03:14.329> as<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.819> really<00:03:17.180> a

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
get as you can see is it really a

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.059 
get as you can see is it really a
difference<00:03:17.660> between<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.470> pots<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:18.920> left

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
difference between the pots of the left

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.160 
difference between the pots of the left
side<00:03:20.170> pots<00:03:21.170> on<00:03:21.380> this<00:03:21.560> side<00:03:22.600> what<00:03:23.600> I'm<00:03:23.750> going<00:03:24.109> to

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
side pots on this side what I'm going to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.890 
side pots on this side what I'm going to
do<00:03:24.380> is<00:03:24.560> end<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.799> experiment<00:03:25.160> today<00:03:25.690> I'm<00:03:26.690> going

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
do is end the experiment today I'm going

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.220 
do is end the experiment today I'm going
to<00:03:26.989> pull<00:03:27.230> them<00:03:27.410> out<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:29.329> we<00:03:29.690> can<00:03:29.870> then<00:03:30.019> have<00:03:30.200> a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
to pull them out and we can then have a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.640 
to pull them out and we can then have a
visual<00:03:30.560> comparator<00:03:32.889> basically<00:03:35.560> with<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
visual comparator basically with the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.819 
visual comparator basically with the
plants<00:03:36.950> out<00:03:37.130> or<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.730> beside<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.600> see<00:03:39.079> if<00:03:40.150> yeah

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
plants out or so beside and see if yeah

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:50.460 
plants out or so beside and see if yeah
well<00:03:42.829> when<00:03:43.250> when<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.750> more<00:03:44.930> detailed<00:03:45.350> level

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.100 

okay<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.530> day<00:03:52.190> five<00:03:52.460> conclusions<00:03:53.270> of<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.810> rose

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
okay so day five conclusions of the rose

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.430 
okay so day five conclusions of the rose
quartz<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:55.540> Keros<00:03:56.540> called<00:03:56.840> crystal<00:03:57.200> on

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
quartz on Keros called crystal on

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.330 
quartz on Keros called crystal on
watercraft<00:03:58.010> growth<00:03:58.820> experiment<00:04:00.220> what<00:04:01.220> I've

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
watercraft growth experiment what I've

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.540 
watercraft growth experiment what I've
done<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.880> pulled<00:04:02.270> out<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.840> evening<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:04.100> I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
done it I pulled out this evening and I

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.600 
done it I pulled out this evening and I
set<00:04:04.820> them<00:04:05.000> side-by-side<00:04:05.330> in<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:05.930> comparison

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
set them side-by-side in the comparison

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.610 
set them side-by-side in the comparison
so<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:08.510> plant<00:04:08.930> seedlings<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.890> have<00:04:10.070> here<00:04:11.620> from

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
so the plant seedlings we have here from

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.280 
so the plant seedlings we have here from
the<00:04:12.770> past<00:04:12.920> we've<00:04:13.160> rose<00:04:13.340> quartz<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.540> these

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
the past we've rose quartz in and these

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.350 
the past we've rose quartz in and these
seedlings<00:04:15.710> here<00:04:16.160> are<00:04:16.489> from<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.910> pots<00:04:17.150> with

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
seedlings here are from the pots with

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.650 
seedlings here are from the pots with
neighbors<00:04:17.780> Colton<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:19.670> despite<00:04:20.150> saying<00:04:20.420> I

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
neighbors Colton so despite saying I

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.210 
neighbors Colton so despite saying I
didn't<00:04:20.930> think<00:04:21.350> there<00:04:21.500> was<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.650> difference<00:04:22.040> from

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
didn't think there was a difference from

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.020 
didn't think there was a difference from
above<00:04:22.640> I<00:04:23.500> think<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.340> could<00:04:25.550> argue<00:04:25.730> this

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
above I think and you could argue this

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
above I think and you could argue this
is<00:04:26.270> purely<00:04:26.930> observational<00:04:27.920> bias<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:29.050> again

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
is purely observational bias that again

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.700 
is purely observational bias that again
as<00:04:30.950> in<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:31.970> previous<00:04:32.450> experiment<00:04:33.230> these

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
as in the previous experiment these

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.310 
as in the previous experiment these
plants<00:04:34.580> here<00:04:34.760> have<00:04:35.030> done<00:04:35.210> better<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:37.040> ones

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
plants here have done better the ones

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.770 
plants here have done better the ones
that<00:04:39.320> were<00:04:39.530> in<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.070> pots<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.430> rose<00:04:40.640> quartz

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.200 

not<00:04:44.780> them<00:04:45.050> quite<00:04:45.830> as<00:04:46.010> well<00:04:46.220> marginal

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
not them quite as well marginal

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.450 
not them quite as well marginal
difference<00:04:49.720> yeah<00:04:50.750> not<00:04:51.140> huge<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:51.560> if<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:52.430> just

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
difference yeah not huge but if we just

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.540 
difference yeah not huge but if we just
look<00:04:52.640> at<00:04:52.910> my<00:04:53.000> pear<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.860> see<00:04:55.130> what<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.370> think

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
look at my pear and see what you think

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.830 
look at my pear and see what you think
from<00:04:55.760> up<00:04:55.910> here<00:04:56.090> again

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
from up here again

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.960 
from up here again
you<00:04:57.020> know<00:04:57.170> maybe<00:04:57.430> observational<00:04:58.430> bias<00:04:58.670> from

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
you know maybe observational bias from

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.110 
you know maybe observational bias from
me<00:04:59.150> but<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.140> think<00:05:00.620> these<00:05:00.890> have<00:05:01.190> done<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.670> bit

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
me but I think these have done a bit

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.890 
me but I think these have done a bit
better<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:03.440> I've<00:05:03.680> just<00:05:03.800> put<00:05:03.920> a<00:05:04.070> ruler<00:05:04.310> here

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
better and I've just put a ruler here

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.360 
better and I've just put a ruler here
kind<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.080> rock<00:05:06.380> example<00:05:07.010> of<00:05:07.100> what<00:05:07.250> the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
kind of a rock example of what the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.610 
kind of a rock example of what the
height<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:08.920> again<00:05:09.920> I<00:05:10.040> think<00:05:10.280> that<00:05:10.610> might<00:05:11.330> be

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
height is again I think that might be

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.430 
height is again I think that might be
off<00:05:12.620> an<00:05:12.830> inch<00:05:13.690> for<00:05:14.690> me<00:05:14.780> tomorrow<00:05:15.080> an<00:05:15.170> average

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
off an inch for me tomorrow an average

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.560 
off an inch for me tomorrow an average
in<00:05:15.590> these<00:05:15.770> ones<00:05:16.010> tried<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.090> make<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.330> base

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
in these ones tried to make the base
