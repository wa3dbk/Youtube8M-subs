00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.440
 Thursday, March 20 the farmers of 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 sundgau was invited by the room 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
 of agriculture attended a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.260
 demonstration of mechanical weeding at 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.880
 roppentzwiller the weeder in action this 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.179
 day there belongs for a week 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.400
 only at richard farm today 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.010
 there were two goals so the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.550
 first is to highlight the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.410
 performance of the tools available on 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.590
 the market today and the second 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 proved that this performance she 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.710
 is currently used in agriculture 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 biological students 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.559
 one of the major obstacles to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.930
 producers are his goal is to pass 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 in bio is the management of weeds 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 the richard farm precisely work in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.969
 conventional and in bio their production 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.550
 de is already certified agriculture 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 biological 9 hectares of cereals are 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.520
 currently in the second year of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.410
 conversion conventional agriculture 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 still concerns the rest of the surfaces 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 cultivated as well as the cattle workshop 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
 the aim being to pass 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.520
 all organic farming 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 by 2015 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.250
 we have a farm of about 80 hectares 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 with different workshops 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.570
 we want to go organic because we 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.560
 think two by the bio we will arrive 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 with what we have 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.130
 without increasing our production or 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.290
 cute monday armaments at the level of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.630
 cattle we will manage to live well behind 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.439
 and so we compare a lot for example 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.180
 for the trials of direct selling for 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.920
 the milk one would also like pulled towards the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.689
 sale grain to direct sale 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 for cereals it will also be 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.380
 following the niches in the end we 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.619
 will try to market our cereals 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.720
 we ourselves so it's really for good 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.060
 value our products and after because 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.159
 we are attracted by the technicality of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.299
 organic farming and we think 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.740
 that today there is a lot to do 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.790
 in this area and also by conviction 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's true we do not see each other 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.750
 processed in class in 30 years that's right 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 think about our health too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.439
 would like to cultivate otherwise everything 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.850
 just the current interest for 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.950
 the farmer to convert to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 organic farming is economical 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.630
 finally we find ourselves in a market 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.909
 a market a mode of production that is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.860
 very bearer the price of cereals is 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.060
 very good we know advise a rotation 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.100
 make a technical plan for that 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.650
 the farmer find themselves there with 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.380
 correct returns that will be valued 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.459
 with a very good price in the market of 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.380
 the organic cereal and which price 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.030
 will definitely stay good long enough 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.709
 since France imports the majority 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 organic cereals that she 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.700
 consume 7 hoeing your forty thousand 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.320
 euros partly because of its guidance 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.030
 by high precision cameras 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.890
 philippe and his associates hope 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.269
 cushion it as quickly as possible 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.370
 thanks to the redemption price of their 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.810
 different productions in bio they 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.250
 took two years of reflection and 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.470
 exchanged with other professionals 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000
 to find this versatile tool 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.220
 the hoe was actually bought for 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.570
 weed all the farm's interests 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.320
 to know that this machine can 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.489
 the cereal weed starts to 14 and 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.370
 half to three meters fifty wide 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.709
 it can also weed soybeans or 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.690
 other culture at any 43 centimeters and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.570
 half wide on or iran and she can 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.570
 also weed weeding plants that 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.400
 are going to be sown an integrator of 77 5 on 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.290
 6 so this machine is really 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.310
 done to work on the completeness 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.650
 crops from their farms 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.470
 this type of investment can make 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.390
 some reluctant farmers 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 however there is the plant plan for 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.660
 the pve environment that helps to help 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.980
 financially buying the purchase of this 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.299
 tool 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.010
 that's why you are advised to 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.100
 contact the Chamber of Agriculture 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.840
 when you want to acquire this type 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.970
 tool for two reasons the first the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.620
 pe as I just pointed out and the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.049
 second to have technical advice 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.329
 to make the right choice and make sure 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.930
 the use of tools will be done in 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.930
 best conditions possible
