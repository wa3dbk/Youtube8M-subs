paper mache but if there's a way yep
I'll<00:01:23.310> find<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.810> found<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.320> I've

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I'll find it and I think I found it I've

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
I'll find it and I think I found it I've
put<00:01:26.100> too<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.490> flour<00:01:26.760> in<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> bowl<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
put too much flour in the bowl when it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.700 
put too much flour in the bowl when it
starts<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> look<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.530> bread<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.610> too<00:01:29.910> dry

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
starts to look like bread it's too dry

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.820 
starts to look like bread it's too dry
if<00:01:31.710> bread<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.369> flour<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> water<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:34.590> eat

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
if bread is flour and water and we eat

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.850 
if bread is flour and water and we eat
it<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:36.000> paper<00:01:36.690> mache<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.110> flour<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> water

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.389 
it and paper mache is flour and water
and<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.910> don't<00:01:39.119> eat<00:01:39.330> it

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
and we don't eat it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.359 
and we don't eat it
think<00:01:41.399> about<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:42.680> every<00:01:43.680> machine<00:01:43.890> turns<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
think about that every machine turns to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.859 
think about that every machine turns to
a<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.850> hard<00:01:45.090> substance

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
a very very hard substance

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
a very very hard substance
what<00:01:46.830> if<00:01:46.920> bread<00:01:47.100> turn<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> poop<00:01:48.680> yeah<00:01:49.850> hard

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
what if bread turn to poop yeah hard

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.920 
what if bread turn to poop yeah hard
poop<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.600> guess<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.710> saying<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.100> eat<00:01:53.250> bread

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930
