00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 it seems and some if you would be interested in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.870
 here of the cameramen myths and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.250
 realities of clear lipo yes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.700
 because I also bet you it's the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.380
 New Year's purpose of the majority is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 lose weight and one of the biggest 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.300
 liposuction tools and that's why I 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220
 It's nice for you as an extra we keep 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.230
 alive 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 How about 29 decision and doubts continue 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 what a wonder not there we will continue too 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.539
 we will follow you hear them we have 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 talked a lot about the lipo but there 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.620
 much myth around a lot of myth 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.379
 doubts things that people have in the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.829
 mind no and well I would like to clarify 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.899
 several exact points the first one that is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 good a liposuction is not going to serve 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 to lose weight have the most 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.789
 think since there are no patients who say 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.490
 so that always open a liposuction 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.250
 ho because it is not to lose weight 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.700
 is to contour the body is contour 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 body or whether we can draw 45 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.040
 liters of fat but does not mean that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.480
 we will lose those 45 kilos that all 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.510
 the week you're going to be thinking that 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.520
 even if you weigh yourself a week 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.230
 after a liposuction it may be that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.970
 keep expressing the same or a little 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.150
 more for the retention of the liquid that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.700
 do you then good myth does not work for 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.010
 lose weight another myth that I have been 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.470
 talked a lot not that they see it as 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.890
 the solution of already if you did a lipo 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.780
 you do not regain weight exactly says 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.570
 do not believe that the treatment is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.820
 definitive and therefore not obviously if you 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.770
 you want to keep the results of a 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.160
 Liposuction either of face abdomen 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.229
 of the gluteus of what you have done 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.840
 you need to continue with a diet and the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.840
 exercise while you are wearing this the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.970
 result or what you have of a surgery 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.040
 You can keep it from a liposuction 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.050
 between 5 and 8 years because 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.420
 the age is obviously advancing 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.280
 metabolism is slowing down and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.979
 you start from normally 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.740
 of fat that not only with exercise 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.200
 you can eliminate those then eye is not 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.080
 forever the result must be given 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 maintenance and good in the longest time 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.080
 possible there are no patients 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.569
 unfortunately we do them the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.120
 treatment the surgery and all three 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.220
 months the value and are the worse 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.200
 say because I also do not know if it's another 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.989
 myth or nothing else is a matter of patients 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 but in counterpart they say that it is as if 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.560
 they will prune you and that the reverse comes a bounce 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.450
 but in addition it is still true what 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.269
 it happens that we remove all fats and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.350
 all the fat cells the deposit 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.739
 it's like a sack 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.600
 then if we leave and remove 80% and 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.040
 we leave 20 to 20 percent that having 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.680
 possible it can be re-inflated 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.380
 very much and we are seeing your image 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.230
 this is about another myth and speaks that 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.069
 says it's to treat or cure the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.900
 cellulite and I did not go much to 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.569
 Sometimes we have patients that with two or 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.360
 three sessions of liposuction spaced 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.070
 between three to six months each one improves 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.580
 a lot but it is not a curative treatment 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.070
 for 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.050
 and another question that has also been 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.140
 become myth is true or not is 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.430
 true that liposuction is recommended 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.920
 when you are really overweight 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.750
 no no no no no no nothing but good 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.540
 there are people who are listening right now 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.150
 this is sounding for treatment of 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.940
 obesity as long as you have 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.770
 also diabetes or hypertension right now 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.860
 they are doing studies at the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.990
 international that eliminate or remove 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.240
 certain amount of fat improves this 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.460
 metabolic syndrome so it's called 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.230
 then but so far it is not 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.330
 authorized is not recommended without 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.610
 However, there are studies and I could 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.950
 to make us about five or ten years 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.840
 helping it to be a treatment 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.550
 adjuvant for this your first exact 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.530
 of but to date we can say that 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.240
 which affirms is simple before a model before 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.670
 and when there is no longer a lot of excess fat 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.280
 are those little deposits that are 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.930
 resist so it's good especially for 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.970
 example men when they want 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.459
 do the abdomen liposuction saying 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.900
 all I will not make muscles 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.590
 they know that they are going to see themselves like that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.049
 squares 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.810
 I say hear if you've been doing 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.550
 abdominal exercises for example this 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.160
 that the skin when adhering is going to 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.380
 sit down to score but if you're not 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.010
 marking the rex 'abdominal muscles 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.639
 If you are not exercising, the skin is stuck 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.350
 the muscles still have the same 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.250
 shape what develops is muscle 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.070
 by marking series and there comes another myth or 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.620
 question let's put it in which they say that 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.669
 the skin hangs tremendously and does not 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.530
 recover that is always the produced thing if 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.930
 we as plastic surgeons 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.419
 we are recommending a liposuction is 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.130
 because we believe that your skin has 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.229
 enough with the penalty that you have the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.290
 ability to retract is like a league 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.090
 also haha ​​no no all patients 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.610
 but all areas are candidates for 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.470
 only under construction not sometimes 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.050
 we have to cut that excess skin 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.610
 so then we value it, but if the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.680
 doctor is recommending that if you are 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.229
 suitable for a liposuction you have to 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.000
 wait between a month and a half and three months 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.340
 that skin retract 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.890
 then it's not like it's going to hang 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.240
 that we send the strips and all the 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.400
 post surgical garments of which 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.150
 we have talked, does not beating the bra like 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.320
 the sleeves the postoperative girdles 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.510
 they are precisely for that skin to be 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.180
 pick up back then the skin does not 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.590
 plays and from there I think there is another myth 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.810
 on the use of sashes according to the 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.940
 temperature and weather not and climate 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.070
 exactly many people want the 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.650
 Winter is the best time to have surgery 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.530
 of liposuction because they say it's cold 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.660
 You put on a belt that does not bother you so much 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.940
 like in the summer but good that also 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.280
 it's a myth I even tell you you know 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.620
 that for the holidays and for the forced and 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.090
 the guadeloupe-kings to forget it is not 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.460
 well you do not have much will power 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.620
 until a liposuction later and already with 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.730
 the little time that we have left another 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.160
 myth that I think is very important 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.260
 many people say it is a treatment 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.820
 totally that he does it to you right now 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.370
 the newly presented ones to the increases the 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.140
 one of the afternoon the extract or because 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.550
 who see that it is aesthetic or that nothing else 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.680
 I will not do and construction from here 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.289
 the arms you are so little do you think that at 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.240
 another will be perfectly and not 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.180
 take also if we take you to 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.889
 operating room because you're being careful 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.839
 is resting being at home is 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.180
 quiet do not think it 's also us 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.919
 nothing but that which is the least invasive 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.379
 Well, if it's an aggression to the body and there's 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.779
 to take care of something and thank you very much 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.520
 for you seriously look and prepare 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.979
 for Christmas and those in liposuction 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.449
 as everything is a good treatment but 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.029
 you also have to put on your part I say 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.189
 do not forget clear and good 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.899
 missing more myths we make you one
