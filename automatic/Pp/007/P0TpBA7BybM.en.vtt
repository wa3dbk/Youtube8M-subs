the<00:00:22.230> way<00:00:22.350> through<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:24.109> you<00:00:25.109> want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.439> go<00:00:25.619> about

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the way through and you want to go about

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
the way through and you want to go about
an<00:00:26.130> inch<00:00:26.279> from<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.820> edges<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.960> way

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
an inch from the edges all the way

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.950 
an inch from the edges all the way
around<00:00:28.789> reason<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.060> when<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.390> roll<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
around reason for that when we roll it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.819 
around reason for that when we roll it
up<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:32.160> stuffing<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.870> expand<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.649> will

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
up the stuffing will expand and it will

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.729 
up the stuffing will expand and it will
ooze<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> ends<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.590> need

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
ooze out to the ends so you don't need

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
ooze out to the ends so you don't need
to<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.340> ends<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:38.790> off<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> bat<00:00:39.239> okay

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
pork up what you need to do is gently

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.240 
pork up what you need to do is gently
fold<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> pork<00:01:12.509> over<00:01:12.690> you<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> too

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
fold the pork over you don't want it too

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
fold the pork over you don't want it too
tight<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.300> firm<00:01:15.800> okay<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.450> ease

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
tight you want it firm okay so just ease

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.249 
tight you want it firm okay so just ease
it<00:01:19.560> over<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.570> tighten<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.050> too<00:01:22.229> much

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it over if you tighten it too much

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
it over if you tighten it too much
you'll<00:01:22.770> lose<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.310> stuffing<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you'll lose all the stuffing out of the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
you'll lose all the stuffing out of the
ends<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> ease<00:01:26.190> it<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:27.590> just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
ends I'm going to ease it around just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.880 
ends I'm going to ease it around just
like<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> keeping<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> stuffing<00:01:30.539> in<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
like so keeping the stuffing in and you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.889 
like so keeping the stuffing in and you
want<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> open<00:01:32.550> edge<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.660> bottom

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
want the open edge on the very bottom

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.700 
want the open edge on the very bottom
when<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> roll<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.830> or<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.000> tie<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.360> up

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
when you roll it or when you tie it up

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
when you roll it or when you tie it up
just<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> technique<00:01:42.180> using<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
just like so the technique using the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.279 
just like so the technique using the
butcher<00:01:43.170> string<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.940> looks<00:01:45.450> difficult<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
butcher string it looks difficult but it

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.070 
butcher string it looks difficult but it
really<00:01:46.470> isn't<00:01:46.800> if<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> route<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
really isn't if this is a route you

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.370 
really isn't if this is a route you
rather<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.800> go<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> get

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
rather not go what you can do is get

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.190 
rather not go what you can do is get
some<00:01:52.440> bamboo<00:01:52.770> skewers<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.960> through

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
some bamboo skewers and just go through

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.050 
some bamboo skewers and just go through
the<00:01:55.380> end<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.910> Pierce<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> pork<00:01:58.619> stays

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
the end and Pierce it so the pork stays

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.029 
the end and Pierce it so the pork stays
shut<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.229> need<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.440> do<00:02:01.709> when<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
shut then what you need to do when you

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.219 
shut then what you need to do when you
bake<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.789> doesn't<00:02:02.970> open<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:04.050> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
bake it so it doesn't open have the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.469 
bake it so it doesn't open have the
skewers<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> bottom<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.910> pan<00:02:06.179> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
skewers on the bottom of the pan that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
skewers on the bottom of the pan that
will<00:02:07.140> hold<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.410> pork<00:02:07.649> together<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> pork

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
will hold the pork together as a pork

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.880 
will hold the pork together as a pork
cooks<00:02:08.910> its<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> tighten<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.200> it'll

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
cooks its going to tighten up it'll

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.229 
cooks its going to tighten up it'll
tighten<00:02:11.069> around<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.459> skewers<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.060> won't

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
tighten around the skewers and it won't

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.660 
tighten around the skewers and it won't
open<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.630> but<00:02:13.170> make<00:02:13.349> sure<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> open

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
open up but make sure you have the open

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.089 
open up but make sure you have the open

edge of the pork on the bottom okay I

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.360 
edge of the pork on the bottom okay I
prefer<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.400> use<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.970> string<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.280> using<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
prefer to use the string so using the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.110 
prefer to use the string so using the
butcher<00:02:23.640> string<00:02:24.230> for<00:02:25.230> piece<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.770> size
