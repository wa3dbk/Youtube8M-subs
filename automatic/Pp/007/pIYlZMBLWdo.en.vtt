off<00:01:46.369> our<00:01:46.610> future<00:01:46.909> is<00:01:47.030> much<00:01:47.209> different<00:01:47.630> from

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
off our future is much different from

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.279 
off our future is much different from
crisis<00:01:48.170> city<00:01:48.380> how<00:01:49.219> so<00:01:50.170> everything<00:01:51.170> is

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
crisis city how so everything is

is just luck anything still intact
otherwise<00:01:56.539> nothing<00:01:57.289> in<00:01:57.560> particular<00:01:57.680> some

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
otherwise nothing in particular some
