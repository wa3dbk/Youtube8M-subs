00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys so I've been working on some

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.900 
hey guys so I've been working on some
game<00:00:03.389> mechanics<00:00:04.049> not<00:00:04.830> necessarily<00:00:05.430> anything

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
game mechanics not necessarily anything

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.440 
game mechanics not necessarily anything
to<00:00:06.270> game<00:00:06.690> pitch<00:00:07.040> I've<00:00:08.040> just<00:00:08.400> decided<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.300> work

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
to game pitch I've just decided to work

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.780 
to game pitch I've just decided to work
on<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.469> reckon<00:00:10.800> some<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> things

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
on this and I reckon some of the things

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.200 
on this and I reckon some of the things
I've<00:00:12.030> done<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.809> far<00:00:12.840> pretty<00:00:13.230> cool<00:00:13.759> so<00:00:14.759> put<00:00:15.000> like

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I've done so far pretty cool so put like

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.050 
I've done so far pretty cool so put like
a<00:00:15.420> curse<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.500> cook<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.369> move<00:00:17.609> towards

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
a curse I can cook and to move towards

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.359 
a curse I can cook and to move towards
it<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:19.080> also<00:00:19.230> hold<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> mouse<00:00:19.859> button<00:00:19.920> down

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
it can also hold the mouse button down

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.109 
it can also hold the mouse button down
and<00:00:20.609> he<00:00:20.760> will<00:00:20.910> follow<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> could<00:00:24.000> just

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and he will follow it so I could just

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.150 
and he will follow it so I could just
click<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.600> down<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> Jeff<00:00:28.019> I've<00:00:28.980> also

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
click way down there and Jeff I've also

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.910 
click way down there and Jeff I've also
got<00:00:29.730> camera<00:00:30.179> clicking<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:31.289> got<00:00:31.500> zooming

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
got camera clicking so I've got zooming

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400 
got camera clicking so I've got zooming
in<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.450> can't<00:00:33.480> zoom<00:00:34.050> in/out

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
in and out but you can't zoom in/out

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.090 
in and out but you can't zoom in/out
past<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.040> walls<00:00:35.250> i<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.670> stop<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> camera

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
past the walls i can stop the camera

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.729 
past the walls i can stop the camera
from<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.399> through<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.850> walls<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
from going through the walls so this is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.040 
from going through the walls so this is
like<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> dynamic<00:00:41.700> camera<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> reacts<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
like a dynamic camera that reacts to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.790 
like a dynamic camera that reacts to
walls

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 

so<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> tan<00:00:47.879> clipping<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:48.960> it's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so I tan clipping off this is what it's

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950 
so I tan clipping off this is what it's
like<00:00:49.350> without<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:50.610> interacting<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> course<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
like without it interacting of course it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
like without it interacting of course it
goes<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.440> grooves<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
goes through grooves and it's kind of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.610 
goes through grooves and it's kind of
just<00:00:54.480> disgusting<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.290> they<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.530> look

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
just disgusting that they can look

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.139 
just disgusting that they can look
through<00:00:55.949> stop<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.590> off

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
through stop back on and no better off

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.310 
through stop back on and no better off
every<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.079> go

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
every now and then you will see it go

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
every now and then you will see it go
through<00:01:01.559> walls<00:01:01.800> that's<00:01:02.220> because<00:01:02.610> I've<00:01:02.790> done<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
through walls that's because I've done a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.790 
through walls that's because I've done a
smooth<00:01:04.019> transition<00:01:04.559> between<00:01:06.590> see<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
smooth transition between see how it

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.590 
smooth transition between see how it
clicks<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.490> between<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
clicks in between there and there's a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
clicks in between there and there's a
slight<00:01:10.229> transition<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.550> of<00:01:11.670> slow<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
slight transition that's kind of slow I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.830 
slight transition that's kind of slow I
flip<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.399> an<00:01:14.640> instantaneous<00:01:15.270> clip

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
flip that or it's an instantaneous clip

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
flip that or it's an instantaneous clip
yeah<00:01:16.440> that's<00:01:16.649> like<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> sometimes<00:01:20.100> it's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
yeah that's like so sometimes it's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.749 
yeah that's like so sometimes it's
slightly<00:01:20.670> click<00:01:21.090> through<00:01:21.360> stuff<00:01:21.630> put<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.500> on

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
slightly click through stuff put that on

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.380 
slightly click through stuff put that on
what<00:01:23.759> kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> looks<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.600> disgusting

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
what kind of looks a bit disgusting

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.750 

single<00:01:28.290> flip<00:01:28.500> around<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.190> where<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
single flip around like that where is

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.120 
single flip around like that where is
like<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.479> much<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:31.290> nicer

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.399 

and<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.759> camera<00:01:35.090> rotation<00:01:35.540> has<00:01:35.840> been<00:01:36.049> smooth

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
and the camera rotation has been smooth

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.370 
and the camera rotation has been smooth
that's<00:01:37.100> normal<00:01:37.729> that's<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.270> smooth<00:01:38.539> which<00:01:39.200> is

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
that's normal that's it smooth which is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:51.550 
that's normal that's it smooth which is
kind<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.710> nice

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:10.290 

here

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

this<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.990> done<00:02:11.440> quite<00:02:11.890> simply<00:02:12.190> actually<00:02:13.320> with

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
this is done quite simply actually with

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.110 
this is done quite simply actually with
a<00:02:14.350> raycast<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:17.560> all<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:18.280> doing<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.790> ray

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
a raycast all all I'm doing is ray

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.280 
a raycast all all I'm doing is ray
casting<00:02:19.690> from<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.200> center<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.680> my<00:02:21.430> guy<00:02:21.670> out

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
casting from the center of my guy out

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.270 
casting from the center of my guy out
towards<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.380> camera<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.560> raycast<00:02:26.980> will

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
towards the camera and the raycast will

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.150 
towards the camera and the raycast will
hit<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> wall<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.710> then<00:02:29.710> all<00:02:29.860> you've<00:02:30.010> got<00:02:30.130> to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
hit the wall and then all you've got to

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.540 
hit the wall and then all you've got to
do<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.550> get<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.060> distance<00:02:32.020> between<00:02:32.170> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
do is get the distance between the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.300 
do is get the distance between the
origin<00:02:33.550> point<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.890> collision<00:02:35.890> point<00:02:36.100> of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
origin point and the collision point of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.830 
origin point and the collision point of
the<00:02:36.460> raycast<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:38.880> then<00:02:39.880> all<00:02:40.000> I've<00:02:40.180> done<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.450> on

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the raycast and then all I've done is on

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.780 
the raycast and then all I've done is on
if<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:42.660> raycast<00:02:43.860> distance<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.160> more<00:02:45.610> than

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
if the raycast distance is more than

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.450 
if the raycast distance is more than
health<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.510> less<00:02:46.780> than<00:02:47.020> alpha<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:48.280> your

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
health is less than alpha that your

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.870 
health is less than alpha that your
camera<00:02:48.850> zoomed<00:02:49.120> out<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.960> alarm<00:02:50.880> forcibly

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
camera zoomed out and alarm forcibly
