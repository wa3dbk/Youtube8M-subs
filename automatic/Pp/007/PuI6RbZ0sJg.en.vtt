it<00:01:55.229> showcases<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.070> using<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.549> using<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
it showcases it using it on using a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
it showcases it using it on using a
variety<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.509> moves<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:58.680> i<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:58.920> i

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
variety of moves all of which i think i

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.889 
variety of moves all of which i think i
could<00:01:59.490> maybe<00:01:59.820> figure<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.570> don't<00:02:00.750> know

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
could maybe figure out i don't know

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.880 
could maybe figure out i don't know
there<00:02:01.049> might<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.200> been<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.380> couple<00:02:01.590> new<00:02:01.860> ones

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
there might have been a couple new ones

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
there might have been a couple new ones
i'm<00:02:02.250> assuming<00:02:02.520> it'll<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> signature

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
i'm assuming it'll have like a signature

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
i'm assuming it'll have like a signature
move<00:02:04.020> maybe<00:02:04.290> unless<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.280> one<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> got

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
move maybe unless the one that it got

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
move maybe unless the one that it got
last<00:02:06.000> gen<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> its<00:02:06.990> signature

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
last gen would just be its signature

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
last gen would just be its signature
move<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.680> general<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> might<00:02:09.149> get

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
move in general but it might get

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.460 
move in general but it might get
something<00:02:09.599> cool<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.319> always

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
something cool with that that always

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.380 
something cool with that that always
been<00:02:10.679> nice<00:02:10.860> also<00:02:11.640> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
been nice also in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.180 
been nice also in
the<00:02:12.480> magazines<00:02:13.020> which<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.500> will<00:02:13.680> show<00:02:13.830> right

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the magazines which I will show right

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.880 
the magazines which I will show right
now<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> picture<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.770> looks

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
now there is a picture of it it looks

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
now there is a picture of it it looks
slightly<00:02:17.069> different<00:02:17.430> though<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
slightly different though it's a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.270 
slightly different though it's a
slightly<00:02:18.240> green<00:02:18.720> tint<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.470> which<00:02:20.069> I'm

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
slightly green tint to it which I'm

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880 
slightly green tint to it which I'm
assuming<00:02:20.490> means<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> shiny

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
assuming means that that is the shiny

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.040 
assuming means that that is the shiny
version<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.730> because<00:02:24.330> shiny<00:02:24.600> mew<00:02:24.810> 2<00:02:24.900> i

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
version of it because shiny mew 2 i

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.380 
version of it because shiny mew 2 i
believe<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.560> slightly<00:02:25.800> green<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.209> kind

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
believe is slightly green so that's kind

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
believe is slightly green so that's kind
of<00:02:27.420> cool<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:27.959> even<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
of cool it that will even be in the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.080 
of cool it that will even be in the
movie<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.709> begin<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.160> if<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.880> is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
movie to begin with if that is what is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.210 
movie to begin with if that is what is
in<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.420> movie<00:02:30.720> otherwise<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.100> be<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
in the movie otherwise that can be a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.310 
in the movie otherwise that can be a
completely<00:02:32.580> different<00:02:32.970> thing<00:02:33.320> entirely

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
completely different thing entirely

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.050 
completely different thing entirely
which<00:02:34.650> could<00:02:34.800> be<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.010> another<00:02:35.340> form<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
which could be like another form of you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580 
which could be like another form of you
too<00:02:36.240> if<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.540> come<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:36.900> multiple<00:02:37.440> ones

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
too if they come out with multiple ones

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350 
too if they come out with multiple ones
that<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.890> very<00:02:38.100> interesting<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.060> first<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that be very interesting but first I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
that be very interesting but first I
just<00:02:39.570> think<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.840> shiny<00:02:40.080> version<00:02:40.500> that's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
just think it's a shiny version that's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220 
just think it's a shiny version that's
pretty<00:02:41.280> cool<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.640> see<00:02:41.670> as<00:02:41.970> well<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.959> anyways

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
pretty cool to see as well but anyways

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
pretty cool to see as well but anyways
that<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.280> video<00:02:44.400> everyone<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
news I've kind of been holding off on

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.430 
news I've kind of been holding off on
making<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.540> video<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> last<00:02:49.020> couple<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> days

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
making a video the last couple of days

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.140 
making a video the last couple of days
just<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.010> knew<00:02:50.190> something<00:02:50.489> from<00:02:50.790> x<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
just because I knew something from x and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150 
just because I knew something from x and
y<00:02:51.239> was<00:02:51.450> going<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> come<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.200> soon<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.800> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
y was going to come out really soon so I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.100 
y was going to come out really soon so I
definitely<00:02:53.400> wanted<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.780> jump<00:02:54.959> on

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
definitely wanted to get the jump on
