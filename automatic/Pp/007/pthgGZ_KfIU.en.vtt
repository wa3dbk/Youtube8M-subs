00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 Be sure to make a gauge before knitting the work 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.660
 Gauges are turtle- knitted so that the same size can be obtained regardless of who knits 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660
 Say 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:29.060
 A gauge that specifies how many eyes are in a 10-cm square at one time is a gauge 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:35.870
 Knitting diagram 2 is always displayed in the number of steps 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.870
 Makes the needle thicker if the specified number of gauge crosses is large 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.050
 Also, if the specified number of folds is small, make the needle thinner 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.590
 Let's actually knit a basic gauge 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.270
 Turn over after the making eyes will start the resentment of the second stage 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.270
 Hmm 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 Hmm 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 Nn 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 I will 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 Hmm 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 When the second row is over , we will change it and weave the third row 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.700
 The third stage will be a table knitting 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.280
 me 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.210
 It has been 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.810
 Wait 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.750
 me 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.049
 Do before you Thank this 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.049
 this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.590
 It is the fourth step when the third step is finished 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.460
 The fourth stage is the purl 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.150
 That knitting Table knit and purl alternately for each one stage 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.150
 We say medias Ami 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:29.160
 If it rains about 20 cm in length, keep your eyes down so that it will not be unwound even if you remove the fabric from the needle 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.190
 We knit two eyes first 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.190
 Hmm 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.770
 me 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.770
 Previously Place the hits first 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.770
 Hmm 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.329
 me 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.329
 can you do 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.850
 can you do 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 Hmm 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.069
 Says the song rice in this way we covered the eyes 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.019
 Second generation eyes are over 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.050
 Stretch the thread and cut with scissors 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.050
 Hmm 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.280
 me 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.060
 I'm thinking 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.930
 of 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.930
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.930
 wh 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.220
 This is done 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.110
 is the first to give medias we can gather only in the table in this way, the front surface 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 Hmm 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.480
 Place the iron in order to adjust the eye 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.569
 Count the number of steps in the frame with a knit gauge 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.569
 Hmm 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.390
 1 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.390
 Then count how many people are in the frame 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.790
 Compare with the designated number
