can be used as an impact tool the
primary<00:00:54.379> fighting<00:00:55.379> component<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.429> the<00:00:56.879> saber

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
primary fighting component of the saber

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.899 
primary fighting component of the saber
is<00:00:57.449> its<00:00:57.780> blade<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> long<00:00:59.190> cutting

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
is its blade you have the long cutting

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.389 
is its blade you have the long cutting
edge<00:01:00.059> typically<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.019> saber<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.859> first<00:01:02.129> half

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
edge typically on a saber the first half

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
edge typically on a saber the first half
of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> blade<00:01:02.969> isn't<00:01:03.569> sharpened<00:01:04.290> that's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
of the blade isn't sharpened that's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.120 
of the blade isn't sharpened that's
where<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> parry<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.150> second<00:01:06.600> half<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
where you parry with the second half is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.289 
where you parry with the second half is
sharpened<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> business<00:01:09.149> end

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
sharpened and that's the business end

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
sharpened and that's the business end
that's<00:01:09.509> what<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> cut<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.200> quite<00:01:11.100> often<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that's what you cut with quite often the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
that's what you cut with quite often the
top<00:01:11.880> edge<00:01:12.149> for<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> first<00:01:12.750> seven

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
top edge for about the first seven

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
top edge for about the first seven
inches<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.920> towards<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> point<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
inches going towards the point is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
inches going towards the point is
sharper<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.479> also<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sharper and also this is to make it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
sharper and also this is to make it
easier<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.729> thrust<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> blade<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:18.960> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
easier to thrust for the blade to go in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
easier to thrust for the blade to go in
sometimes<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.399> perfect

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
sometimes you don't have a perfect

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.819 
sometimes you don't have a perfect
opening<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> lot<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.899> time<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.500> thrust

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
opening or a lot of time for your thrust

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.270 
opening or a lot of time for your thrust
so<00:01:23.250> even<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.000> lesser<00:01:24.990> movement<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.950> blade

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so even a lesser movement of this blade

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280 
so even a lesser movement of this blade
when<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.060> fully<00:01:27.390> sharp<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.049> allow<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
when it's fully sharp and will allow it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
when it's fully sharp and will allow it
to<00:01:28.439> enter<00:01:28.799> even<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> slight

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to enter even when you have a slight

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
to enter even when you have a slight
opportunity<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.320> good<00:01:31.380> idea

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
opportunity so it's a really good idea

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.630 
opportunity so it's a really good idea
to<00:01:32.189> sharpen<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.880> edge<00:01:33.149> of<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.420> saber

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
to sharpen the back edge of your saber

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.499 
to sharpen the back edge of your saber
the<00:01:35.640> hilt<00:01:36.000> offers<00:01:36.509> both<00:01:36.689> protection<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.590> an

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
the hilt offers both protection and an

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
the hilt offers both protection and an
offensive<00:01:39.509> weapon<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.229> keeps<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
offensive weapon it keeps your

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
offensive weapon it keeps your
opponent's<00:01:42.000> blade<00:01:42.719> off<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.380> hands<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:43.979> out

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
opponent's blade off your hands and out

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
opponent's blade off your hands and out
of<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.670> fingers<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> thumb<00:01:45.539> it<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.350> acts

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
of your fingers and thumb it also acts

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
of your fingers and thumb it also acts
as<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> giant<00:01:47.280> pair<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> brass<00:01:47.820> knuckles<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
as a giant pair of brass knuckles you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.279 
as a giant pair of brass knuckles you
can<00:01:48.990> punch<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.880> melee<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.960> close

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
can punch with it in a melee or up close

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.590 
can punch with it in a melee or up close
and<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.590> fighting<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.820> hammer<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.359> with

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and in fighting you can hammer down with

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.760 
and in fighting you can hammer down with
the<00:01:54.780> butt<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:57.210> good

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770

little heavier I'll go to a
three-quarters<00:03:17.580> wrap<00:03:17.820> if<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.210> gives<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.570> a

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
can very quickly change my angle of

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.850 
can very quickly change my angle of
attack<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:29.100> can<00:03:29.430> very<00:03:29.640> quickly<00:03:29.820> defend<00:03:30.480> and

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
attack I can very quickly defend and

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.050 
attack I can very quickly defend and
counter-attack<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> blade<00:03:32.760> is

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
counter-attack but the blade is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660 
counter-attack but the blade is
literally<00:03:33.480> alive<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.590> hand<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.100> I'm<00:03:35.490> going

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
literally alive in my hand and I'm going

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.410 
literally alive in my hand and I'm going
to<00:03:35.730> use<00:03:35.970> gravity<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.959> my<00:03:37.500> Ally<00:03:38.040> as<00:03:38.280> opposed<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
to use gravity as my Ally as opposed to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.090 
to use gravity as my Ally as opposed to
having<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.900> fight<00:03:40.170> with<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.530> weapon<00:03:40.830> all<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
having to fight with the weapon all the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.040 
having to fight with the weapon all the
time<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.060> first<00:03:42.330> thing<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.720> grip

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
time so the first thing is the grip

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.590 
time so the first thing is the grip
think<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.800> terms<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.790> begins<00:03:45.120> at<00:03:45.300> 90

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
think in terms of this it begins at 90

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.900 
think in terms of this it begins at 90
degrees<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.650> squeezes<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.280> about<00:03:47.489> 60
