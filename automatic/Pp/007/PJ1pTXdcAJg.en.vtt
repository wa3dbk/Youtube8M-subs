00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.960
 a production cycle 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 It's a taste more than 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.119
 so it deserves to end 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.730
 at the end of the period 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.810

 to present what is possible for the expenditure of the product 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.940
 before I made the milk I expected 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.870
 when administration 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.000
 needed to change the consumption of a given product 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.110
 but do not have to produce 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.759

 and with that the administration works 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550
 on 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.940
