00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 what was the game plan for sanji and 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.960
 Did I have to adjust it badly? 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.750
 the course of the meeting but what was the plan 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 play your football more turn 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.949
 rather than think there is a good opponent 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.980
 the field is nice nice atmosphere very 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.320
 many fans just needed it 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.260
 the task was not to get lost on the contrary 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.380
 feel confident start 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.690
 control the ball and that we basically and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.489
 did after removal of course it became 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.890
 a little harder in terms of what 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.800
 building up in defense like that more or less 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
 of course they did it already because 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 even though they scored a goal 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 the minority he was a little harder 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 Of course we can say that the team played 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.199
 unlike 1 match completely 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 liberated psychologically 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 it seemed that in this meeting your 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.710
 maximum but i think not maximum i think 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 all the same 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 there is still a reserve anyway 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.880
 the best games i'm sure are still ahead 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 the fact that they played well liberated 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.720
 sure this is a fact after the match in 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.750
 dressing room see what was the atmosphere 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.820
 that is, there was a holiday feeling that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 have achieved a good result or 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 nevertheless, with a brother that prevailed 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.640
 account did not keep wins serge kornilenko 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.619
 what was the atmosphere of the plane i just 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.020
 I do not know, I immediately went there by car 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:40.159
 home of course I think the atmosphere was 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 a good plus still survived such 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.530
 can say half time in 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.840
 minority 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 even with all this managed to score 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.670
 goal what final atmosphere was on 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 good such games are probably just 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.409
 train and practice 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 in the course of the matches after it arose 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.580
 certain questions to the arbiter on your 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.369
 sight 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.970
 impacted how did you make his decision as a result 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.130
 given what was happening on the field and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 Are these claims valid? 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.040
 Well, as for probably in Malachi and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.290
 second half then here of course on my 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.670
 the gaze here was 100% 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.980
 a fan 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.269
 here but what concerns the removal of their 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.860
 hand then here I think no complaints 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.530
 to him can't you really have been 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.170
 two violations for which the judge was 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.540
 rightly rate it as two yellow 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.750
 cards but if we talk about what 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.730
 once more the judge helped anji it was 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.570
 I can say that there have been worse in the game 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.650
 we are therefore not accustomed to this and 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.620
 so much on the field it's not 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.750
 felt like the result of sanji up 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.329
 inspires confidence can be 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.120
 psychological in you personal to the team 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.660
 something that really caught your game and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.790
 there are a lot of good matches ahead of us 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.240
 the result but certainly certainly after 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.340
 such games of confidence on comes and 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.520
 I hope that we swept and continue to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.290
 the next game but here, too, again 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.540
 after such good games right 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.610
 but played again on a good field with 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.450
 so I'm not good for some kind of aura 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.970
 was present 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.349
 sign we now have fields probably such 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.510
 the fields will be difficult to show such 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.090
 good game so here probably 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.190
 there will be more struggle but right now 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.200
 in our position it is more important 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.319
 Now on earlier such a good game but 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.510
 it certainly does not 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.160
 not least and basically I think everything 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.739
 still 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.690
 Go and win a garden and there will be 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:58.200
 depend on how physically we are 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.200
 we will show ourselves well thanks
