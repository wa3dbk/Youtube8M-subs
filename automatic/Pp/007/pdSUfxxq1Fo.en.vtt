into the shoes right now
hariya<00:00:43.700> pretty<00:00:44.700> good<00:00:44.940> color<00:00:45.930> separations<00:00:46.969> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
hariya pretty good color separations the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
hariya pretty good color separations the
black<00:00:48.300> spurts<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:51.180> very<00:00:51.620> less

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
black spurts very good it's a very less

bleeding<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> paper<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> comes<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
bleeding on the paper when it comes to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.250 
bleeding on the paper when it comes to
collars<00:00:55.980> separations<00:00:56.989> especially<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
collars separations especially when you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.040 
collars separations especially when you
work<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.760> high-end<00:00:59.760> photographic<00:01:00.629> papers

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
work with high-end photographic papers

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.670 
work with high-end photographic papers
so<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.329> good<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.559> with

the ink if you volume devolopment
printers<00:01:07.320> very<00:01:07.530> low<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.970> would<00:01:09.090> be

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
printers very low that would be

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
printers very low that would be
something<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> little<00:01:09.750> cedar<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
want to start using the laser machine

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
want to start using the laser machine
especially<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.590> colors

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
especially if you're going to do colors

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you want to get a laser machines might

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
you want to get a laser machines might
be<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.150> pricey<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.650> also<00:01:32.100> the

volume of it might be might be a good
suggest<00:01:36.329> them<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> laser<00:01:36.930> machine<00:01:37.369> also

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
suggest them to get a laser machine also

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
suggest them to get a laser machine also
something<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> consider<00:01:39.240> these

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
something you want to consider these

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.700 
something you want to consider these
days<00:01:40.049> most<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> major<00:01:41.360> factors<00:01:42.360> are

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
days most of the major factors are

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.660 
days most of the major factors are
putting<00:01:43.710> everything<00:01:43.890> together<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.579> know

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
putting everything together you know

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
putting everything together you know
that<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that they all time would just be the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.330 
that they all time would just be the
copier<00:01:46.979> fax<00:01:47.820> machines<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:49.350> laser<00:01:49.710> machine<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
copier fax machines the laser machine so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.670 
copier fax machines the laser machine so
for<00:01:50.549> now<00:01:50.670> everything<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.360> called

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
for now everything is called

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
for now everything is called
multifunction<00:01:52.680> printers<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.030> like

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
multifunction printers they have like

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.190 
multifunction printers they have like
this<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.810> example<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.820> has

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
this one for example also it has

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.149 
this one for example also it has
scanning<00:01:58.200> faxing<00:01:58.950> copying<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.420> printing<00:02:01.159> so

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
scanning faxing copying and printing so
