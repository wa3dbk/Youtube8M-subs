 at 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.200
 abdoulaye aw is vincent see cpjp 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.200
 philippe marouane 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.050
 it's a kind of super smash bros 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.030
 Brawl for what is sure they 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.949
 remember on wii but it's a 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.050
 playstation version with all the heroes 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.089
 playsation and I think it's great 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.040
 cool I find that just at the level of 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.680
 moves it's a little slow otherwise 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540
 it's dynamic it moves it's not going to me 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.739
 what I do not quite understand these lÃ©vy or 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.879
 converse bah there it's so much fun 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.530
 it's a bit weird 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.149
 he has a very good grip 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.440
 now the steps if they went 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.500
 intuitive and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.600
 a disconcerting ease of play just 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 press to be certain key for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 costs frankly no she's not bad 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.330
 solo play I do not know what it 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 worth it but in multi is in any case it's ok 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.350
 really the stroke stratos him versus 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.050
 for example it could attack 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.250
 other end of the screen it was 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.020
 unplayable same 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.540
 yeah that was a rake if they 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.100
 had cracked everyone else 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.700
 with kratos we had four crac I 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.050
 believe that everyone understood 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.590
 that it was a little swift so the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.570
 other and premiums and cities to the south 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.789
 but they were very long and spitting 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.890
 also to stuff well there we played with 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.109
 I played with la vita and it was 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.729
 still very complicated bah I 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.869
 look at the screen in fact it's like 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.890
 I had a controller in hand so I 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.259
 find that change it is not 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 really obvious me trophy all the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.920
 touch time 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.360
 I had the button r2 and all that I 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.850
 did not know what was it 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.859
 since not often plays ps vita 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.509
 it's all about habitat 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.670
 missed keys compared to the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.649
 ps3 controller and I could not for example 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 access certain costs because it 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.360
 was missing some ruin that if I 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.620
 reproach to compared to the hall at the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.840
 ps vita report to the controller 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.569
 if not 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.370
 with ps vita that's it really gives 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.800
 a good game perspective the restless 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.319
 ingres I 'm going a lot to brawl so there 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.200
 I find myself a little bit here they took 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.890
 the same recipe it's different but the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.140
 recipe is the same 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.980
 I have had the opportunity to play both 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.269
 and I still preferred the briefcase 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.540
 it's more accessible 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.430
 we feel better actually on the controller I 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.870
 find it less 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.640
 ordered in less speed less gross than 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.379
 smash bros but he looks ready 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.819
 smash brawl technique it was really 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.250
 the brothel that typed in every way 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.340
 there it is we swoon the buttons it gives 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.719
 nothing and that makes shit it's worth 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.269
 to pass itself is the same principle 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.939
 I think it's funny it was a 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.349
 little more tactical all that finally 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.340
 depends on which level to play but there 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.349
 it's a lot more between friends 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.969
 it's funny and its souks 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.689
 smash bros it's even easier to 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:14.060
 to play because I do not have the stage 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.909
 took it's wise we can not 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.579
 drop his sauce and parise have changed that 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.889
 compared to smash bros ie 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.840
 we are a game it is what in 2d what 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.060
 distort summer placed that right to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.290
 left we can see fall necessarily a 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.919
 big melee that's a shame 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.810
 yeah yeah yeah I buy it direct is 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.090
 clearly yeah that's really good 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.389
 I love the world of sony playstation 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.019
 the free characters and company believes 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.240
 frankly that I liked me well I 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.830
 will surely buy it 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.810
 we will buy to do that in an evening 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.930
 between repeats and where it's really the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.930
 class
