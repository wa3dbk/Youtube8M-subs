00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.720
 fanboy for my size device I would like 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.220
 that this is less 5.0 more fan boy who 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.330
 stuck to education which is paying all 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.920
 linked to stocks at the price of two dollars 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.420
 and what it allows you to face and 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.800
 to animate the he counts they are the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.410
 on the springboard of your device 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.270
 the seconds are aldok the dates that 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.980
 indicates the number of pages and the wac and 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.540
 francky the full back then that 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.920
 just works for the springboard of 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.899
 your device of course then you have 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.090
 all the effects finally you have the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.030
 possibility to put jitter inc kenzi 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.620
 exact menara outside makes that all 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.510
 that you have to do if he buy 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.710
 install confirmed once they 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.390
 were installed will be designed united 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.800
 springboard of your fanboys 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.329
 who heads the same place in the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 fine adjustments as we can see 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.739
 on my springboard currently we see 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.120
 that my dock federated or not even men 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.250
 and ring gods ie a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.809
 swing from left to right j mee la 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.700
 same kind of effect for the dock 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.070
 so if we get sent here it's the same 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.990
 thing when we founded a sister then 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.110
 fingers also makes you see that 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.640
 it's done I'll be consistent here 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.530
 same thing on the second page on 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.420
 all pages faction it goes in the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.610
 settings of course you have football here 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.470
 you must put a year that 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.150
 firstly I put jitter reign here 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.500
 that I can show you all 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.939
 effects to you to test them 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.920
 finally you still have the opportunity 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.310
 depending on the sections to put no 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.630
 effect then here if we look a little bit so 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.460
 I put a little more to the right 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.950
 you'll see it's a little bit more 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.930
 long to move from left to right then 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.030
 that's controlling the time the animation 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.880
 made me I 'm not ready I put it to 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.840
 at around 1.251 it's moving fast 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.549
 acceptable 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.130
 which will return to the settings 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.079
 the icons that's still the others 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.490
 when you close an application this 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.810
 never no effect because if you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.700
 put something go the ags and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.619
 finally we see that it jerks a little 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.000
 but you get the idea that 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.039
 that it makes everything change the seconds 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.590
 when closing an application does that 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.840
 I leave it to our effects the gimmi dock 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 always jeetoo ring fac if we see that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.520
 it's jogging like on the dock 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.410
 maximin zoom zoom out and know well 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.530
 zuma 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.140
 of Tuesday as this makes these only 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.000
 animations the bell little their soul and 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 hadji land keith hampton or even there 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 put a name effect finally that I want 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.720
 just be it the dock that moves the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 springboard sorry that was the locle 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.570
 and else I took off with 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.810
 activator mass and the same principle 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.980
 that's where sql pumping shown here then 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.560
 you have small dots for 10 and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.160
 that you have two pages does that the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.160
 small dots 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.080
 it's controlled by the dowry so it can 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.500
 zoom in or bad it's the same kinds of 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.210
 movements 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.890
 finally that you decide whoever did not want 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.780
 get there faster 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.450
 me I put your nofx price that it does not 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.130
 gives nothing to do it because they are 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
 did not know springboard from my device and the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.570
 wallpaper that's when you go 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.890
 fermi apply it an application fac to 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.930
 in the settings like this 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.380
 moment they pose that it's like 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.220
 a drop of water made as soon as I closed 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.320
 keep ben walker 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 it makes a little bubble that if I 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.870
 put it faster you'll see what it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.850
 will do the beauty to see faster if I 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.270
 the food next day akhenaton here 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.100

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.580
 in the wallpapers we are always the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.920
 same animations in our same minus 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.550
 does that now flip left to 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.720
 right but it's going to flip like this 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.800
 does not hurt that I did well 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.820
 loved their shoulders for the press this is 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.310
 to hide every second 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.910
 viral infection iphone that we did not 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.500
 no need 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.830

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.790
 total of five stars so why 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.420
 this brand new kind of animation nand 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.850
