00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.330
 I took xr the energizing drink for 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.790
 all Colombian boxers champion 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.529
 of the champions we are already here 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.980
 at the Miami International Airport 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.990
 welcome teacher to this and the last 20 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.570
 Darley Perez is already going to take what 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 is going to be this big fight and that we're 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.170
 in a city leaving the Cubans 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.619
 course this good chosen site 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.110
 precisely to acclimate to give you here 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.090
 let's do some sessions of parry and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.060
 above all we will work on what of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.290
 acquisition speed 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.570
 at a high level of reaction to 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.760
 get set up for the fight 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.290
 do not worry about the Cubans who are 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.670
 suddenly they will give you the fight to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.670
 give him and suddenly that giving him 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.380
 so you do not worry about that from 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.300
 soon the Cubans are going to see to give 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.740
 to train the glove is not that I 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.570
 I want with which I do not come for 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.940
 make them witchcraft I believe in witchcraft 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.910
 so I'm going to do some tricks of 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.700
 witchcraft to guide him to turn it off 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.040
 and all those things the environment the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.900
 required then for that reason 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.140
 we came here we know there are 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.740
 nail 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.240
 a group of cuban boxers here we go to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.970
 pay some to help us 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.520
 do sparring and logically and also 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.100
 so much to give them in the style environment 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.870
 Cuban boxing era knows pretty well 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.030
 for him it was a long time 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.500
 as an Olympic-style boxer he 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 He faced many Cubans to whom 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.540
 he also won no problems to come 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.940
 to the mouth with your story give it now 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.970
 Well, we're already in boxing with 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.940
 the point with giving him and he gets with his 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.710
 suitcase the illusion of this great combat 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.050
 in canada and now that is in miami 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.720

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.360

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.550
 get ready for the fight and go up 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 do my job and ready what we know 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.580
 is a junior who comes from 126 pounds 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.780
 rises to 135 pounds I think that 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.780
 that will be something favorable for you 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.360
 and it can be and it can not be but 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.370
 how come to make them fight like 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.490
 the tea has to go find no tunnel 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.520
 exactly we have to do a job 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.710
 pretty good in that aspect and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.390
 wait for him to come and counterattack 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.040
 and ready to protect a strategy of 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.900
