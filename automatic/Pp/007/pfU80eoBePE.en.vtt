00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.720
 I 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.719
 6 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.399
 it's been ten years since the laws exist 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.930
 prevents to produce this kind of music 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.000
 outside places that can receive 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 public so labeled etc 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.120
 we know very well that they asked for 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 permissions in this context we do not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 was absolutely not getting so we do not 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 could not we knew very well that we 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.000
 was borderline had the risk of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.089
 the evening is canceled at any time 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 the system is confiscated that here 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.600
 so we lived with this record during 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 ten years because it was important for 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.089
 we present this scene under this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.379
 angle and today after ten years after 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.159
 that we did this countdown because 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 that we realized that they were 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.509
 more and more difficult we have 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.960
 decided maybe to change format of 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.670
 to space the moments of having 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.050
 different ambitions be also of 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.360
 produce informally in 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.910
 places like this one has since 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.289
 we are given the opportunity to 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.649
 to improve the sound in conducting our 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.759
 skills to light the video of the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.649
 to give your impression when 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 even in a place that sees passing 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.610
 they have me every day is not a 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.470
