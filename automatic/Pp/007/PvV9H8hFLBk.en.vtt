00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
the house tough to come obviously have

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.230 
the house tough to come obviously have
you<00:00:15.660> preseason<00:00:16.470> stuff<00:00:16.859> every<00:00:17.640> fitness<00:00:17.970> coach

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you preseason stuff every fitness coach

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450 
you preseason stuff every fitness coach
as<00:00:18.390> their<00:00:18.539> own<00:00:18.630> ideas<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:18.990> stuff<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.470> uh<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.890> was

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
as their own ideas and stuff so uh I was

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.429 
as their own ideas and stuff so uh I was
always<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.300> here's<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
always this now but I think here's the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.599 
always this now but I think here's the
added<00:00:22.680> pressure<00:00:22.830> you're<00:00:23.189> fighting<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
added pressure you're fighting for a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.890 
added pressure you're fighting for a
place<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> World<00:00:24.300> Cup<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
place for the World Cup with you so you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170 
place for the World Cup with you so you
have<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.400> grown<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.670> against<00:00:27.000> boys

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
have your you have grown up against boys

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
have your you have grown up against boys
who<00:00:27.869> were<00:00:27.960> fighting<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> same<00:00:28.470> shirt<00:00:28.800> or

who were fighting for the same shirt or

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
who were fighting for the same shirt or
maybe<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.480> makes<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> tips<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.080> over<00:00:31.170> the

I think you know I think Poland father
it<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.329> it's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it is what it is I think you know it's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.450 
it is what it is I think you know it's
the<00:00:52.050> facilities<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.559> great<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the facilities are great there and you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.889 
the facilities are great there and you
know<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.420> everything<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
know we go that way from everything you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
know we go that way from everything you
know<00:00:54.930> cuz<00:00:55.140> he<00:00:55.199> fly<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.620> Gdansk<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> it's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
know cuz he fly into Gdansk and it's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
know cuz he fly into Gdansk and it's
like<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> three-hour<00:00:57.600> bus<00:00:57.780> journey<00:00:58.020> nowhere

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
like a three-hour bus journey nowhere

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
like a three-hour bus journey nowhere
and<00:00:58.920> obviously<00:00:59.340> we<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.690> really

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and obviously we can do have to really

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.209 
and obviously we can do have to really
focus<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.410> training<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.010> that's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
focus on your training I think that's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.139 
focus on your training I think that's
why<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.910> away<00:01:03.030> from

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
why we go there to get away from

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
why we go there to get away from
everything<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.080> focus<00:01:04.170> on

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
everything and really just focus on

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
everything and really just focus on
ourselves<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.309> camp<00:01:05.820> we're<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.600> out

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
ourselves and the camp we're in the out

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.600 
ourselves and the camp we're in the out
the<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> train<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.740> poori<00:01:08.189> alien<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the to train to make that poori alien to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.109 
the to train to make that poori alien to
most<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.939> us<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.630> haven't<00:01:09.780> done<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
most of us we haven't done much of it

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
most of us we haven't done much of it
it's<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.390> tough<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:12.950> it's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's going to be tough there but it's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.260 
it's going to be tough there but it's
good<00:01:14.100> good<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> spend<00:01:14.549> again<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
good good to spend again some time to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
good good to spend again some time to
get<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.570> quality<00:01:15.659> time<00:01:15.810> together<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
get some quality time together as a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
get some quality time together as a
squad<00:01:16.830> maybe<00:01:17.340> away<00:01:17.610> from<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> line<00:01:18.060> made<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
squad maybe away from the line made the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
squad maybe away from the line made the
whales<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> goldfish<00:01:19.560> ball

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
whales like that kind of goldfish ball

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.240 
whales like that kind of goldfish ball
I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:20.909> company<00:01:22.250> obviously

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I think it's all about company obviously

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.429 
I think it's all about company obviously
after<00:01:23.520> last<00:01:23.790> World<00:01:24.030> Cup<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.110> pleased

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
after last World Cup as really pleased
with<00:01:25.530> results<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.670> think

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
with results I think you know I think

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.190 
with results I think you know I think
not<00:01:27.030> only<00:01:27.060> myself<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> whole<00:01:27.930> squad

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
not only myself but the whole squad

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
not only myself but the whole squad
realized<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.340> probably

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
realized you know it was probably

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.840 
realized you know it was probably
fittest<00:01:29.820> we've<00:01:29.970> been<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.200> unit<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:32.369> not

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
fittest we've been as a unit for if not

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
fittest we've been as a unit for if not
you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.390> first<00:01:33.659> time<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.020> ever<00:01:34.140> Jimmy<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you know first time or ever Jimmy and it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.310 
you know first time or ever Jimmy and it
was<00:01:34.799> brilliant<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.750> yeah<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.930> hard<00:01:37.110> work

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
was brilliant and yeah it's hard work

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.569 
was brilliant and yeah it's hard work
but<00:01:37.500> obviously<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:37.920> pays<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.280> towards

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
but obviously it all pays off towards

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.980 
but obviously it all pays off towards
the<00:01:38.610> end<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.030> last<00:01:39.240> World<00:01:39.420> Cup<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.780> looking

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the end but last World Cup I was looking

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
the end but last World Cup I was looking
after<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> part<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.100> we

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
after to be a part of it you know and we

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.999 
after to be a part of it you know and we
were<00:01:41.640> fit<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.090> fair<00:01:42.619> no<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> were<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
were fit to be fair no if you were to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
were fit to be fair no if you were to
fit<00:01:44.189> us<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.210> brand<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.960> we

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
fit us that was brand little bit but we

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.920 
fit us that was brand little bit but we
were<00:01:46.170> fit<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.770> did<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.100> some<00:01:47.810> really<00:01:48.810> good

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
were fit we did make some really good

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
were fit we did make some really good
games<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> gym<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.340> field<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> yeah

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
games in the gym on the field so yeah

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.300 
games in the gym on the field so yeah
obviously<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.229> fit<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.009> more

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
obviously the fit you are the more

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.679 
obviously the fit you are the more
chance<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.729> gallery<00:01:54.060> especially<00:01:54.630> at

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
chance to do gallery especially at

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.630 
chance to do gallery especially at
international<00:01:55.110> level<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.470> think<00:01:55.680> sometimes<00:01:56.520> in

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
international level I think sometimes in

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.100 
international level I think sometimes in
the<00:01:56.700> past<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.060> probably<00:01:57.360> our<00:01:57.600> Achilles

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the past is probably our Achilles

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740 
the past is probably our Achilles
everywhere<00:01:58.860> we've<00:01:58.979> faded<00:01:59.939> off<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.570> end<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
everywhere we've faded off at the end of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
everywhere we've faded off at the end of
the<00:02:00.840> games<00:02:00.990> while<00:02:01.770> I'll<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.100> strong

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the games while I'll be in strong

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.490 
the games while I'll be in strong
positions<00:02:02.729> doing<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.119> or<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:04.110> three<00:02:04.350> yeah

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
positions doing this or all three yeah

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.399 
positions doing this or all three yeah
you<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.100> start<00:02:05.659> start<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you see we can start start the with a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.380 
you see we can start start the with a
bang<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.220> hopefully<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
bang really and then hopefully like a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.699 
bang really and then hopefully like a
bit<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> momentum<00:02:09.869> effect<00:02:10.379> home<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
bit of momentum effect home for the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.890 
bit of momentum effect home for the
World<00:02:10.860> Cup
