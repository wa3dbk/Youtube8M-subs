00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
being a bridge operators I don't know

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
being a bridge operators I don't know
about<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> misconceptions<00:01:59.250> I<00:02:00.179> think<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.509> used

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
about the misconceptions I think it used

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
about the misconceptions I think it used
to<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.929> that<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.320> all<00:02:01.469> thought<00:02:01.740> we're<00:02:02.070> old

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to be that they all thought we're old

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.709 
to be that they all thought we're old
and<00:02:02.520> fat<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.409> think<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:05.450> true<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.479> any

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and fat and I think that's true in any

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.900 
and fat and I think that's true in any
profession<00:02:13.129> they're<00:02:14.129> up<00:02:14.250> there<00:02:14.430> sleeping

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
profession they're up there sleeping

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.420 
profession they're up there sleeping

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
yeah I think that's the biggest thing is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.690 
yeah I think that's the biggest thing is
that<00:02:17.459> they<00:02:18.209> seem<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.569> think<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:19.459> they<00:02:20.459> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
that they seem to think that they just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.920 
that they seem to think that they just
sit<00:02:21.629> around<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:23.370> nothing<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:24.150> sleep<00:02:24.599> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
sit around and do nothing but sleep and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:34.559 
sit around and do nothing but sleep and
open<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.739> bridge<00:02:26.660> that's<00:02:27.660> really<00:02:28.349> not<00:02:28.500> true

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.949
