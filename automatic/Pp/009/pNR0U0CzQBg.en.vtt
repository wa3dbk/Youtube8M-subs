 that can purchase look i need the dates 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 where do you start with the camera 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.120
 you use a pan that can handle 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 the heat is also sitting and the board 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.670
 sugar in a thin layer on the bottom 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.869
 spread and then wait until the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 sugar and beautiful and luring color 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.950
 am this movement windows we know 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950
 scattered boskalis 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.960
 sugar is now closed and now we do the 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.960
 butter 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.820
 defend each other nicely over the bottom 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.250
 from the pan and then we came 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.890
 there and the shower with the cut side 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 down 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.240
 and of course you between us 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.950
 and then it's the turn of a browse 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.190
 I have a package of frozen puff pastry 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.830
 let it thaw and it's all slices 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.630
 seperate to defrost and expose on a 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 to pass up stack 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.019
 the pictures southwards 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.209
 and have neatly finished in all slices 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.709
 a pile laid once rolled out 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.660
 to a rectangular piece and we are going 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.120
 won in the model that we want 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.120
 have one in time for three women 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.940
 drank a little 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.940
 at the workplace 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.200
 little flower on top of the bed 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.200
 you did it and we will call it 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.409
 in lotr again to about the thickness 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.030
 which the pictures were the origin so 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.870
 it's so 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.870
 3 mm 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.930
 Work water roll out tomorrow so you have one 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.180
 nice thick poop gets so dependent 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.250
 makes that must have 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.650
 then I cut a global circle through 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.549
 but your captured form 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.549
 do you strive off 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:45.470
 then we literally take the foil b 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.860
 to dough over the squares in the dam you 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.090
 he is still too big for me so me 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.090
 just go make a size smaller 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.340
 next to your good size and then we go with 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.490
 stop in 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:19.220
 That means you have the edge to it 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:21.290
 pushes down to your tickets are that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.600
 looks like this 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.570
 and that's how the oven goes 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.070
 I grab my data at 180 degrees about that 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.070
 about 20 minutes of joke 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:05:09.300
 that armed so long and gold and that 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:05:12.690
 and the delicious 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.400
 go brown carpet with spacious 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.070
 serve well with a scoop of ice cream as 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.130
 dessert or both a cup of coffee with 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.260
 manslaughter and want that and my version 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.940
 of that it comes to light in our 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.380
 intent to go to every episode of 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.930
 universe to the design from it 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.420
 program and then deeper into it 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.740
 to go during this wreck 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.060
 this time I went through with 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.550
 puff pastry from the freezer and the 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.110
 supermarket very easy but can 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.240
 Of course also that you yourself puff 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.370
 makes've never done 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.440
 explain it is difficult to hear no 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.660
 costs forever 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.980
 handyness is not too bad if you want that 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.420
 I show that once 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.220
 just leave me a message that we 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.040
 life hurt how much to contention 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.480
