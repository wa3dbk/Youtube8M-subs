something that I just ran across this is
the<00:00:06.870> tiniest<00:00:08.929> remotely<00:00:09.929> controlled

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
mass production it's very cute I can't

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.460 
mass production it's very cute I can't
even<00:00:16.800> find<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.190> place<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.580> hold<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.470> made

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
even find a place to hold on to it made

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.560 
even find a place to hold on to it made
a<00:00:19.500> few<00:00:19.740> modifications<00:00:19.890> put<00:00:20.820> some<00:00:21.000> color<00:00:21.270> tape

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a few modifications put some color tape

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
a few modifications put some color tape
on<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.710> doggone<00:00:23.100> thing

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
on it so I can see this doggone thing

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
on it so I can see this doggone thing
it's<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> modifications<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> transmitter

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it's a modifications to the transmitter

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's a modifications to the transmitter
and<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.660> thought<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> did<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.800> pass<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.310> on

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and I thought I did I just pass this on

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.080 
and I thought I did I just pass this on

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:28.880 

nothing<00:01:18.740> happened<00:01:19.159> there

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:43.840 

the<00:01:29.890> gear<00:01:30.190> is<00:01:30.340> not<00:01:30.550> meshing

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.120 

okay<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.180> buzzing<00:01:45.659> came<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.650> gear

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
okay the buzzing came because this gear

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.740 
okay the buzzing came because this gear
this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.000> sloppy<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:49.370> they<00:01:50.370> make<00:01:50.750> noise

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this is so sloppy here they make noise

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.859 
this is so sloppy here they make noise
if<00:01:52.140> they're<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.440> messed<00:01:52.800> right<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:54.630> was

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
if they're not messed right and it was

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.859 
if they're not messed right and it was
not<00:01:55.190> binding<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.790> believe<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
not binding so believe it or not all I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.370 
not binding so believe it or not all I
did<00:01:58.110> was<00:01:58.229> loosen<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> screw<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.070> this<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
did was loosen the screw on this so the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.560 
did was loosen the screw on this so the
body<00:02:01.619> isn't<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.160> tight<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.910> went<00:02:03.360> back

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
body isn't so tight and that went back

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
body isn't so tight and that went back
the<00:02:03.810> meshing<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:05.220> shouldn't<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.550> any

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the meshing and you shouldn't have any

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.090 
the meshing and you shouldn't have any
trouble<00:02:06.150> with<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.650> yeah<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.680> little

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
trouble with that yeah that little

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.279 
trouble with that yeah that little
infrared<00:02:09.060> receiver<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.810> there<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.170> not

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
infrared receiver right there I'm not

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
infrared receiver right there I'm not
crazy<00:02:10.560> about<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.039> location<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
crazy about the location of that it's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.020 
crazy about the location of that it's
just<00:02:12.390> above<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> seat<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.340> problem<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.850> when

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
just above the seat the problem is when

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.010 
just above the seat the problem is when
you're<00:02:15.150> coming<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:15.810> out<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> sky

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
you're coming down out of the sky

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.340 
you're coming down out of the sky
rapidly<00:02:19.850> you're<00:02:20.850> aiming<00:02:21.360> down<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
rapidly you're aiming down at the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.340 
rapidly you're aiming down at the
helicopter<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:23.550> out<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.880> sight<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.810> you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
helicopter and it's out of sight so you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.770 
helicopter and it's out of sight so you
usually<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:26.100> crash<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:27.239> out<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.540> range

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
usually will crash going out of range

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.830 
usually will crash going out of range
over<00:02:28.590> those<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.510> receivers<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
over those that little receivers on the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.570 
over those that little receivers on the
bottom<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.410> think<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.739> should<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.040> here<00:02:32.400> on

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
bottom I think it should be up here on

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.040 
bottom I think it should be up here on
the<00:02:32.700> top<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.239> most<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.630> time<00:02:33.870> you're

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the top and most of the time you're

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.140 
the top and most of the time you're
pointing<00:02:34.380> down<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.980> I've<00:02:35.280> added<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.790> mirror

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
pointing down at it I've added a mirror

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.509 
pointing down at it I've added a mirror
on<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.630> bottom<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.250> when<00:02:38.370> I'm

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
on the bottom of here so that when I'm

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.150 
on the bottom of here so that when I'm
aiming<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.739> infrared<00:02:40.739> light<00:02:40.980> will

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
aiming down the infrared light will

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.550 
aiming down the infrared light will
bounce<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.670> instead<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:43.410> more

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
bounce up instead of a little more

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.550 
bounce up instead of a little more

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
other side there was none in there but

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.390 
other side there was none in there but
it<00:02:50.850> does<00:02:51.060> hold<00:02:51.299> there's<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.660> flat<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.200> notch<00:02:53.130> on

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
it does hold there's a flat and notch on

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.300 
it does hold there's a flat and notch on
this<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.750> gears<00:02:55.049> get<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> little<00:02:55.650> sloppy<00:02:55.950> I

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
this but the gears get a little sloppy I

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.680 
this but the gears get a little sloppy I
added<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.030> washer<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.570> spacer<00:02:58.230> under<00:02:58.590> here<00:02:58.829> so

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
added a washer for spacer under here so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.690 
added a washer for spacer under here so
if<00:03:00.690> these<00:03:01.230> gears<00:03:01.530> wouldn't<00:03:01.829> be<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.130> sloppy<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
if these gears wouldn't be so sloppy and

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.729 
if these gears wouldn't be so sloppy and
it's<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:03.150> smooth<00:03:03.600> when<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.230> gets<00:03:04.440> sloppy

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
it's a little smooth when it gets sloppy

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.509 
it's a little smooth when it gets sloppy
it<00:03:05.010> won't<00:03:05.220> fly<00:03:06.769> as<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.070> see<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
it won't fly as you can see here I

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.060 
it won't fly as you can see here I
modified<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.209> my<00:03:09.450> transmitter<00:03:10.049> sticks<00:03:10.500> but<00:03:10.769> it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
modified it my transmitter sticks but it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:19.750 
modified it my transmitter sticks but it
didn't<00:03:11.430> help

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.040 

okay<00:03:20.760> there's<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.030> couple<00:03:21.060> delicate<00:03:21.780> things

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
okay there's a couple delicate things

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.650 
okay there's a couple delicate things
here<00:03:22.320> want<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> show<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:22.890> one<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.330> little

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
here want to show you one if this little

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.010 
here want to show you one if this little
rivet<00:03:25.020> pops<00:03:25.260> out<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:26.600> it's<00:03:27.600> going<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.870> be

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
rivet pops out of here it's going to be

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.930 
rivet pops out of here it's going to be
out<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.170> balance<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:29.550> you're<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.880> a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
out of balance so if you're all of a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.970 
out of balance so if you're all of a
sudden<00:03:30.240> to<00:03:30.300> start<00:03:30.600> shaking<00:03:31.080> look<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.860> your

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
sudden to start shaking look for your

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.500 
sudden to start shaking look for your
rivet<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.520> going<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.790> put<00:03:32.940> mine<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.330> with

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
rivet I'm going to put mine in with

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.470 
rivet I'm going to put mine in with
amazing<00:03:33.840> group<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.380> little<00:03:34.620> drop<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:36.330> also

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
amazing group a little drop on it also

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.660 
amazing group a little drop on it also
helps<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.900> lot<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.170> trim<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.530> out<00:03:37.620> first<00:03:38.010> we

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
helps a lot to trim it out first we

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:47.120 
helps a lot to trim it out first we
apply<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:45.590> okay<00:03:46.590> I've<00:03:46.740> made<00:03:46.770> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
apply it okay I've made the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.150 
apply it okay I've made the
modifications<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:49.200> my<00:03:49.320> transmitter<00:03:49.890> so

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
modifications here to my transmitter so

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.910 
modifications here to my transmitter so
I<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.460> hold<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.880> doggone<00:03:51.390> thing<00:03:51.560> I've<00:03:52.560> shown

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
I can hold the doggone thing I've shown

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.730 
I can hold the doggone thing I've shown
you<00:03:53.040> about<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.640> screw<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.180> top<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.870> the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
you about the screw on the top and the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.360 
you about the screw on the top and the
motors<00:03:56.130> let's<00:03:56.940> go<00:03:57.150> ahead<00:03:57.270> and<00:03:58.220> give<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
motors let's go ahead and give it a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.830 
motors let's go ahead and give it a
little<00:03:59.580> flight<00:03:59.850> here<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.330> what<00:04:00.510> happens

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.880 

sadly<00:04:03.840> there's<00:04:04.050> no<00:04:04.110> way<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.470> make<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.740> go

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
sadly there's no way to make it go

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.640 
sadly there's no way to make it go
forwards<00:04:05.520> or<00:04:05.670> backwards<00:04:05.730> only<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.960> or<00:04:07.140> down

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.930 

well<00:04:15.650> no<00:04:15.740> matter<00:04:15.980> how<00:04:16.130> much<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.459> try<00:04:16.610> to<00:04:16.700> get

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
well no matter how much you try to get

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.790 
well no matter how much you try to get
to<00:04:17.060> trim<00:04:17.330> close<00:04:17.630> that's<00:04:18.290> all<00:04:18.500> you're<00:04:18.650> ever

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
to trim close that's all you're ever

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.430 
to trim close that's all you're ever
going<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.310> close<00:04:19.840> turning<00:04:20.840> left<00:04:21.020> or<00:04:21.200> right

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
going to get close turning left or right

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.620 
going to get close turning left or right
is<00:04:21.650> done<00:04:21.890> with<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.160> right<00:04:22.400> stick<00:04:22.790> but<00:04:23.480> it's

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
is done with the right stick but it's

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.780 
is done with the right stick but it's
either<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:24.050> or<00:04:24.080> off<00:04:24.350> it's<00:04:24.800> not<00:04:25.010> proportional

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
either on or off it's not proportional

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.300 
either on or off it's not proportional
so<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.600> can't<00:04:27.110> just<00:04:27.350> proportionately<00:04:28.010> turn

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
so you can't just proportionately turn

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.930 
so you can't just proportionately turn
it<00:04:29.200> then<00:04:30.200> if<00:04:30.410> you<00:04:30.500> do<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.980> trim<00:04:31.220> close<00:04:31.520> you

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
it then if you do get the trim close you

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.120 
it then if you do get the trim close you
know<00:04:31.970> adding<00:04:32.510> power<00:04:32.930> or<00:04:33.200> removing<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.890> makes

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
know adding power or removing it makes

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.990 
know adding power or removing it makes
it<00:04:34.310> spin<00:04:34.610> since<00:04:35.360> there's<00:04:35.570> no<00:04:35.750> gyro<00:04:36.290> so<00:04:37.040> it's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
it spin since there's no gyro so it's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.610 
it spin since there's no gyro so it's
just<00:04:38.210> going<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.420> basically<00:04:38.600> go<00:04:39.140> up<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.500> down

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
just going to basically go up and down

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:51.210 
just going to basically go up and down
and<00:04:39.920> spin<00:04:40.700> which<00:04:40.880> whichever<00:04:41.360> way<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.660> turn<00:04:41.780> it

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.680 

you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:08.590 

here<00:05:00.140> we<00:05:00.260> go<00:05:00.910> sink<00:05:01.910> settle<00:05:02.270> down

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:28.110 

you

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.629 

at<00:05:29.020> least<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.440> mere<00:05:29.710> kept<00:05:29.980> it<00:05:30.130> from<00:05:30.250> going<00:05:30.400> out

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
at least a mere kept it from going out

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:37.620 
at least a mere kept it from going out
of<00:05:30.669> range<00:05:35.490> but<00:05:36.490> once<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:36.880> get<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.210> all<00:05:37.360> figured

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
of range but once you get it all figured

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.580 
of range but once you get it all figured
