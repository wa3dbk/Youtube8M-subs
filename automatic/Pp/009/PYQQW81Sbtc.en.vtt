the<00:01:43.290> first<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:43.829> being<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> he<00:01:44.369> said<00:01:44.579> he

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the first of which being that he said he

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
the first of which being that he said he
play<00:01:45.000> tested<00:01:45.450> domination<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.320> time

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
play tested domination with no time

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
play tested domination with no time
limit<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> round<00:01:47.670> switch<00:01:47.970> whenever<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
limit with a round switch whenever it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.389 
limit with a round switch whenever it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
hits a hundred points first and a win at
200<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:51.930> goes<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> later<00:01:52.619> say<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
200 so then he goes on to later say I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
200 so then he goes on to later say I
didn't<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> would<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
didn't think that I would like it but it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.389 
didn't think that I would like it but it
eliminates<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> strangeness<00:01:56.040> with

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
eliminates some of the strangeness with

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.399 
eliminates some of the strangeness with
mathematical<00:01:57.149> elimination<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.899> games

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
mathematical elimination and the games

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
mathematical elimination and the games
still<00:01:58.829> go<00:01:59.009> fast<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.909> guys<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
still go fast so you guys do you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
still go fast so you guys do you
remember<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.600> black<00:02:00.840> ops<00:02:01.049> 2<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.710> were<00:02:01.740> two

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
remember in black ops 2 there were two

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
remember in black ops 2 there were two
rounds<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.149> time<00:02:03.479> based<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.170> could

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
rounds but it was time based you could

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
rounds but it was time based you could
exceed<00:02:04.829> 100<00:02:05.460> points<00:02:05.729> per<00:02:06.030> round<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.509> if<00:02:06.570> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
exceed 100 points per round and if that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.449 
exceed 100 points per round and if that
was<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> case<00:02:06.960> pretty<00:02:07.829> much<00:02:07.950> you'd<00:02:08.129> end<00:02:08.310> up

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
was the case pretty much you'd end up

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.100 
was the case pretty much you'd end up
winning<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> game<00:02:09.060> regardless<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> had<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
winning the game regardless if you had a

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.839 
winning the game regardless if you had a
great<00:02:10.560> first<00:02:10.770> half<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.310> would<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
great first half it would take a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.550 
great first half it would take a
monumental<00:02:12.599> collapse<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.349> n

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
monumental collapse to n

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.589 
monumental collapse to n
losing<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.069> any<00:02:14.190> second<00:02:14.670> half<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.000> domination

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
losing at any second half of domination

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.690 
losing at any second half of domination
so<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:16.080> Vonderhaar<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.709> hinting<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.280> here<00:02:17.550> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so what Vonderhaar is hinting at here is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.150 
so what Vonderhaar is hinting at here is
something<00:02:18.060> genuinely<00:02:18.930> new<00:02:19.050> for<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.010> that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
something genuinely new for the way that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.860 
something genuinely new for the way that
domination<00:02:20.610> has<00:02:20.730> been<00:02:20.940> approached<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.569> call

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
domination has been approached in call

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
domination has been approached in call
of<00:02:21.900> duty<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.260> recent<00:02:22.860> years<00:02:22.890> something<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
of duty in recent years something that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.070 
of duty in recent years something that
would<00:02:23.970> probably<00:02:24.360> work<00:02:24.510> out<00:02:24.750> pretty<00:02:24.959> well

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
would probably work out pretty well

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.199 
would probably work out pretty well
honestly<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> cool<00:02:26.220> idea<00:02:26.430> something

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
honestly this is a cool idea something

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.000 
honestly this is a cool idea something
that<00:02:27.360> gives<00:02:27.780> us<00:02:28.050> maybe<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.770> bit<00:02:28.920> of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
that gives us maybe a little bit of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.979 
that gives us maybe a little bit of
insight<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:29.880> black<00:02:30.090> ops<00:02:30.300> 3<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.660> right<00:02:30.840> now

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
insight with black ops 3 but right now

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.660 
insight with black ops 3 but right now
that<00:02:31.319> isn't<00:02:31.560> anything<00:02:32.040> he<00:02:32.280> said<00:02:32.459> he'd<00:02:32.550> just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
that isn't anything he said he'd just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.670 
that isn't anything he said he'd just
play<00:02:32.970> tested<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:33.989> confirmed<00:02:34.380> or

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
play tested it it's not confirmed or

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
play tested it it's not confirmed or

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
denied anything like that it's just

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.300
