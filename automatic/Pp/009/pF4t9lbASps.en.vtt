more<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:26.040> having<00:01:26.220> expectations<00:01:26.549> they

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
more than not having expectations they

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
more than not having expectations they
lead<00:01:27.900> by<00:01:27.930> example<00:01:28.140> he's<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> yellowing

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
lead by example he's not a yellowing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
lead by example he's not a yellowing
screamer<00:01:30.329> he<00:01:30.750> goes<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.380> he<00:01:31.619> mamas<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
screamer he goes out and he mamas is a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.510 
screamer he goes out and he mamas is a
very<00:01:32.610> talented<00:01:33.799> player<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.040> he<00:01:35.100> scores<00:01:35.369> big

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
very talented player and he scores big

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.920 
very talented player and he scores big
goals<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.939> certainly<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> team<00:01:36.509> leans<00:01:36.750> on

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

trying to achieve our goals and the next
level<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.349> he's<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:11.069> his<00:02:11.280> way<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.629> to<00:02:12.680> play

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
level I think he's on his way to to play

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
level I think he's on his way to to play
at<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> pro<00:02:14.069> level<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.580> see<00:02:15.060> him<00:02:15.180> or<00:02:15.239> his<00:02:15.330> game

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
at the pro level and see him or his game

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.449 
at the pro level and see him or his game
through<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.080> certainly<00:02:16.680> he's<00:02:16.830> he's<00:02:17.250> got<00:02:17.430> a

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
through there certainly he's he's got a

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.250 
through there certainly he's he's got a
lot<00:02:17.580> more<00:02:17.640> goals<00:02:18.060> than<00:02:18.150> him<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.420> year<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
lot more goals than him this year the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.930 
lot more goals than him this year the
fact<00:02:19.500> he's<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.860> away<00:02:20.040> from<00:02:20.099> his<00:02:20.430> total<00:02:20.819> from
