00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
so I guess reptillus here's a fluke

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.819 
so I guess reptillus here's a fluke
really<00:00:34.940> me<00:00:35.090> treat<00:00:35.390> don't<00:00:35.660> be<00:00:35.810> business<00:00:36.200> often

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829

only the one feeding them often is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.900 
only the one feeding them often is
because<00:00:39.260> they<00:00:39.500> don't<00:00:39.560> like<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:40.040> rest<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.790> it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
is a five gallon so yeah and then I have

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.130 
is a five gallon so yeah and then I have
a<00:02:31.180> thirty

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
a thirty

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.490 
a thirty
I<00:02:32.380> think<00:02:33.190> 30<00:02:33.520> or<00:02:33.670> 20<00:02:34.060> gallon<00:02:34.360> filter<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:35.110> there

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
I think 30 or 20 gallon filter in there

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000 
I think 30 or 20 gallon filter in there
which<00:02:35.710> is<00:02:35.740> really<00:02:35.920> good<00:02:36.280> on<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.860> want

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
which is really good on so as you want

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.950 
which is really good on so as you want
currents<00:02:39.520> as<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.180> see<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.780> ball

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
currents as you can see like the ball

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.870 
currents as you can see like the ball
would<00:02:41.170> actually<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> jug<00:02:42.430> down<00:02:42.640> here
