 been after a long time of many 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.240
 Monday this is not because I did not want 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.190
 or because he's a super busy guy but 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.170
 sometimes quite simply I 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 it makes it a bit harder to record this game and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.960
 him and edit it but we're on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.400

 let's go let's go like this without hands without hands 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.130
 in the hands of care because it takes away 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.330
 without hands although we are one level up 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.750

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.070

 ok let's first give a wind look 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.530
 long 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.730
 and now we are with a map that is called 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.080
 modern art to see so let's go with 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.300

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.610

 Straight though there are more balls are not in 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.740
 more rather than not that it does not say 50% 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.380
 difficult ok 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.850
 it says red is bad blue is good ok all 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.960
 the red ones are bad things so 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.960
 we have to see from the other side 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.049
 ok ok ok everything all fine 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.069
 fucking mother to see we have to pass this 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.980
 this is going to come out at the first this is going to 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.430
 go out to the first time easy easy ok ok 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.910
 ok ok ok ok no 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.970
 [Music] 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.990
 then the best happy player 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.810
 history wheels 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.390
 well we went through it ok bone is very easy 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.340
 very easy after we went through this thing 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.210
 rotating then the one that follows after 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.070
 the one that follows and we keep moving forward and ok 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.980
 ok to see me that I have to stay without 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.250
 arms but but not by extremely 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.500
 simple does not stop being simple and now 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.150
 it's a blur for which I no longer have 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.980
 arms but we take it to us the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.700
 we play we play it we play it 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.830
 we use them like wow oh wow 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.540
 let's see we have to fall from the other side 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.220
 where is the blue part so we're going to 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.790
 do it the first time because I am 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.790
 Super pro 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.230
 you can still still be can be a 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.700
 type of wow 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.019
 we have one but I have some hands 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.019
 stupid that do not reach 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.550
 some aerodynamic movements around 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.760
 aerodynamic moments that I learned in my 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.220
 Zumba class and perfect or ok now 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.080
 now now I did in the movies that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.090
 maybe if I swing my legs a little 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.950
 and managed to get the ones from the box 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.860
 maybe we're already on the other side to see 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.320
 we jump to tito there's no there 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.120
 perfect perfect now and only 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.760
 we need to enter maybe first the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.350
 head or that is not not as easy as 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.210
 Juarez is not as easy as it seems 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.510
 although the first first the first the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.640

 [Applause] 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.279
 I really did not think that being fat was 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:21.229
 so bad is not as easy as it seems 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.229
 life of the fat is sad I suppose 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.590
 or 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.490

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.460
 we started here 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.870

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.860

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.449
 time that delayed 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.909

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.960
 between the balls of a number because we are 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.939
 very vulgar to see is that it is not so 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.729
