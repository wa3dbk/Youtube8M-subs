00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
through the tile an object is to get to

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.119 
through the tile an object is to get to
the<00:05:28.069> helipad<00:05:28.459> or<00:05:28.729> kill<00:05:28.879> 25<00:05:29.239> zombies<00:05:29.859> so<00:05:30.859> yeah

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:45.799 
sometimes you might discover card it

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:48.039 
sometimes you might discover card it
might<00:05:45.919> become<00:05:46.069> useful<00:05:46.489> later<00:05:46.869> so<00:05:47.869> there's

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:48.049 
might become useful later so there's

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:57.580 
might become useful later so there's
four<00:05:48.109> spaces<00:05:48.589> here<00:05:48.949> so<00:05:49.159> for<00:05:49.429> zombies<00:05:55.539> 34

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
four spaces here so for zombies 34

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.650 
four spaces here so for zombies 34
