00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
this map the only thing that I struggle

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390 
this map the only thing that I struggle
with<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.090> getting<00:02:24.870> from<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.410> side<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.770> map<00:02:26.100> to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
with is getting from one side of map to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100 
with is getting from one side of map to
the<00:02:26.550> other<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> little<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.600> confusing

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
the other it's a little bit confusing

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.110 
the other it's a little bit confusing
navigating<00:02:28.980> your<00:02:29.130> way<00:02:29.190> through<00:02:29.670> either<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
navigating your way through either the

navigating your way through either the
cave<00:02:30.540> or<00:02:31.230> through<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:32.010> top<00:02:32.310> area<00:02:32.790> there's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
cave or through that top area there's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.460 
cave or through that top area there's
some<00:02:33.240> paths<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.780> everything<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.200> but

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
some paths and everything like that but

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.190 
some paths and everything like that but
by<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.070> large<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.760> large<00:02:36.240> map<00:02:36.630> that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
by and large this is a large map that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.530 
by and large this is a large map that
plays<00:02:37.590> really<00:02:38.190> small<00:02:38.580> though<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.240> all

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
plays really small though because of all

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.120 
plays really small though because of all
the<00:02:39.690> corridors<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.800> different

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the corridors and all the different

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.380 
the corridors and all the different
things<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.460> also<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.000> there's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
things I also like it because there's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.540 
things I also like it because there's
not<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.630> lot<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:42.990> verticality<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.490> you

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
not a lot of verticality you know you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.800 
not a lot of verticality you know you
don't<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.000> worry<00:02:45.120> about<00:02:45.240> somebody<00:02:45.510> being

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
don't have to worry about somebody being

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.990 
don't have to worry about somebody being
up<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.200> top<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.770> roof<00:02:47.010> top<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.820> know<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
firing assault rifles for this map and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.490 
firing assault rifles for this map and
there<00:02:54.240> was<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> Michael<00:02:54.690> Myers<00:02:55.020> character

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500

somebody<00:02:57.750> has<00:02:58.140> gotten<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.890> from<00:02:59.550> doing<00:03:00.060> one

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
somebody has gotten that from doing one

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.910 
somebody has gotten that from doing one
of<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> care<00:03:00.780> package<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> field

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
of the care package one of the field

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.770 
of the care package one of the field
orders<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.520> pick<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.330> basically

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
orders and pick that up now basically

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.320 
orders and pick that up now basically
it's<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.130> having<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.700> maniac

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
it's just like having a maniac

juggernaut<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.380> far<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.010> tell<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.610> a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
juggernaut as far as I can tell it's a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.000 
juggernaut as far as I can tell it's a
little<00:03:09.000> bit<00:03:09.120> different<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.010> unfortunately

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
little bit different but unfortunately

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.200 
little bit different but unfortunately
that<00:03:11.250> means<00:03:11.430> when<00:03:11.700> you're<00:03:11.820> playing<00:03:12.060> in

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
that means when you're playing in

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.660 
that means when you're playing in
hardcore<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.930> makes<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.290> super<00:03:13.860> easy<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.460> take

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
hardcore it makes it super easy to take

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.580 
hardcore it makes it super easy to take
that<00:03:14.910> person<00:03:15.450> out<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.690> wish<00:03:16.080> they<00:03:16.110> would<00:03:16.410> change

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that person out I wish they would change
