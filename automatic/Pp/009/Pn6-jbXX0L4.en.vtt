once<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.310> while<00:02:40.489> your<00:02:40.700> body<00:02:40.879> gets<00:02:41.629> used<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.159> like

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
once a while your body gets used to like

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.039 
once a while your body gets used to like
the<00:02:43.310> same<00:02:43.549> old<00:02:43.579> same<00:02:44.120> old<00:02:44.180> you're<00:02:44.629> not<00:02:44.750> getting

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
the same old same old you're not getting

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.099

be the fastest person in the world but

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.680 
be the fastest person in the world but
i'm<00:03:33.980> consistent<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.090> look<00:03:35.269> at<00:03:35.419> this<00:03:35.510> I've

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
i'm consistent just look at this I've

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.680 
i'm consistent just look at this I've
been<00:03:35.810> training<00:03:36.400> consistently<00:03:37.400> for<00:03:37.879> years<00:03:38.480> I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
been training consistently for years I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.569 
been training consistently for years I
hardly<00:03:38.959> ever<00:03:39.079> missed<00:03:39.500> more<00:03:39.680> than<00:03:39.709> like<00:03:39.919> two<00:03:40.280> or

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
hardly ever missed more than like two or

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.030 
hardly ever missed more than like two or
three<00:03:40.609> days<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.359> row<00:03:41.540> tops<00:03:42.319> I'm<00:03:42.620> out<00:03:42.799> there

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
three days in a row tops I'm out there

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.189 
three days in a row tops I'm out there
every<00:03:43.099> week<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:44.030> gotta<00:03:44.359> say<00:03:44.569> I'm<00:03:44.750> not<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
every week I gotta say I'm not the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.050 
every week I gotta say I'm not the
fastest<00:03:45.739> long-distance<00:03:46.430> runner<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
fastest long-distance runner in the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.089 
fastest long-distance runner in the
world<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:48.019> but<00:03:48.349> then<00:03:48.590> again<00:03:48.620> look<00:03:48.949> at<00:03:49.040> my

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
world and but then again look at my

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.229 
world and but then again look at my
training<00:03:49.639> though<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:49.790> haven't<00:03:50.030> been

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
training though I haven't been

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.300 
training though I haven't been
practicing<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:51.109> haven't<00:03:51.319> been<00:03:51.379> training<00:03:51.889> for

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
practicing I haven't been training for

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.210 
practicing I haven't been training for
like<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.609> know<00:03:52.639> fast<00:03:53.090> speed<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.569> just<00:03:53.870> long

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
like you know fast speed I just long

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.220 
like you know fast speed I just long
zone<00:03:55.220> 2<00:03:55.519> kind<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> runs<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.659> I<00:03:57.079> am<00:03:57.199> very

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
zone 2 kind of runs and I am very

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.990 
zone 2 kind of runs and I am very
humbled<00:03:57.709> when<00:03:57.949> it<00:03:58.129> comes<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.549> running<00:03:58.730> it's

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
humbled when it comes to running it's

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.110 
humbled when it comes to running it's
not<00:03:59.120> my<00:03:59.329> natural<00:03:59.900> sport<00:04:00.799> if<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.190> look<00:04:01.790> at<00:04:01.940> my

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
not my natural sport if you look at my

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.970 
not my natural sport if you look at my
height<00:04:02.569> and<00:04:02.780> physique<00:04:03.139> you<00:04:03.290> know<00:04:03.409> I'm<00:04:03.739> almost

there's no coincidence why I gravitated

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.839 
there's no coincidence why I gravitated
towards<00:04:09.109> basketball<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.069> tennis<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.609> look

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
like I've stood next to them I look like

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.319 
like I've stood next to them I look like
professionals<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.370> those<00:04:13.579> sports<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.209> that's

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
maintaining that speed over miles I'm

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.330 
maintaining that speed over miles I'm
still<00:04:30.510> working<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.440> getting<00:04:31.710> good<00:04:32.190> at<00:04:32.310> that

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340

again<00:04:39.060> that's<00:04:39.330> not<00:04:39.570> been<00:04:39.780> my<00:04:39.810> training<00:04:40.170> goal

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
again that's not been my training goal

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.200 
again that's not been my training goal
my<00:04:40.650> training<00:04:41.010> goal<00:04:41.130> has<00:04:41.250> been<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.400> build<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.940> big

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
my training goal has been to build a big

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.020 
my training goal has been to build a big
miles<00:04:42.540> base<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.290> now<00:04:43.710> I'm<00:04:43.950> starting<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.310> add

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
miles base and now I'm starting to add

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.540 
miles base and now I'm starting to add
more<00:04:45.210> speed<00:04:45.630> work<00:04:45.840> into<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.380> one<00:04:47.220> thing<00:04:47.400> you

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
more speed work into it one thing you

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.250 
more speed work into it one thing you
might<00:04:47.670> be<00:04:47.880> wondering<00:04:48.120> what<00:04:48.720> about<00:04:48.900> weight

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
might be wondering what about weight

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.350 
might be wondering what about weight
loss<00:04:49.290> how<00:04:49.800> does<00:04:49.830> weight<00:04:50.460> loss<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:50.730> running

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
loss how does weight loss and running

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
into it it's really easy to hurt
