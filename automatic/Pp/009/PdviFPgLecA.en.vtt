hey guys at route 91 here and today

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.869 
hey guys at route 91 here and today
we're<00:00:02.990> doing<00:00:03.140> the<00:00:03.290> mg<00:00:03.680> 4<00:00:04.009> in<00:00:04.310> the<00:00:04.400> custom<00:00:04.700> cost

we're doing the mg 4 in the custom cost
guide<00:00:05.089> and<00:00:05.390> the<00:00:05.479> Mt<00:00:05.749> falls<00:00:06.080> a<00:00:06.259> kind<00:00:06.740> of<00:00:06.890> a

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:07.339 
guide and the Mt falls a kind of a

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.879 
guide and the Mt falls a kind of a
letdown<00:00:08.269> of<00:00:08.480> a<00:00:08.719> gun<00:00:08.929> it's<00:00:09.200> got<00:00:09.349> a<00:00:09.380> fast<00:00:09.650> rate<00:00:09.860> of

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
letdown of a gun it's got a fast rate of

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.499 
letdown of a gun it's got a fast rate of
fire<00:00:09.980> with<00:00:10.429> low<00:00:10.610> recoil<00:00:10.849> but<00:00:11.210> it's<00:00:11.330> got

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
fire with low recoil but it's got

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.869 
fire with low recoil but it's got
terrible<00:00:12.019> iron<00:00:12.200> sights<00:00:12.500> simply<00:00:12.889> because<00:00:13.250> the

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
terrible iron sights simply because the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.759 
terrible iron sights simply because the
iron<00:00:14.120> sights<00:00:14.509> are<00:00:14.719> actually<00:00:15.110> misaligned

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
iron sights are actually misaligned

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.259 
iron sights are actually misaligned
where<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.670> tips<00:00:17.660> on<00:00:18.019> the<00:00:18.320> iron<00:00:18.859> sights<00:00:19.160> are

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
where the tips on the iron sights are

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.670 
where the tips on the iron sights are
they<00:00:20.269> don't<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.840> bullets<00:00:21.140> do<00:00:21.230> not<00:00:21.380> actually

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
they don't the bullets do not actually

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.169 
they don't the bullets do not actually
fire<00:00:21.980> from<00:00:22.279> there<00:00:22.460> they<00:00:22.699> come<00:00:22.939> from

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
fire from there they come from

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.410 
fire from there they come from
underneath<00:00:23.779> where<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:24.789> the<00:00:25.789> little<00:00:26.060> prongs

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
underneath where the the little prongs

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.650 
underneath where the the little prongs
or<00:00:26.890> tips<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.519> little<00:00:28.789> whatever<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.449> fuck

or tips of the little whatever the fuck

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.440 
or tips of the little whatever the fuck
you<00:00:29.779> want<00:00:29.929> to<00:00:29.990> call<00:00:30.140> them<00:00:31.180> that's<00:00:32.180> actually

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
you want to call them that's actually

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.420 
you want to call them that's actually
where<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.840> bullets<00:00:33.170> come<00:00:33.379> out<00:00:33.530> from<00:00:33.860> which<00:00:34.219> is

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
where the bullets come out from which is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.369 
where the bullets come out from which is
why<00:00:34.579> I<00:00:34.610> deem<00:00:35.059> them<00:00:35.270> as<00:00:35.420> terrible<00:00:35.750> in<00:00:35.989> science

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
why I deem them as terrible in science

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.690 
why I deem them as terrible in science
but<00:00:36.500> if<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.739> wasn't<00:00:37.040> for<00:00:37.100> this<00:00:37.250> discrepancy

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
but if it wasn't for this discrepancy

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.740 
but if it wasn't for this discrepancy
they<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.809> would<00:00:38.960> be<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.200> very<00:00:39.469> good<00:00:39.800> gun<00:00:40.010> but

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
they it would be a very good gun but

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.959 
they it would be a very good gun but
it's<00:00:41.750> got<00:00:41.899> a<00:00:41.930> large<00:00:42.230> clip<00:00:42.680> with<00:00:43.010> very<00:00:43.760> good

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
it's got a large clip with very good

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.049 
it's got a large clip with very good
damage<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.410> sidearm<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.370> suggest<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
damage and the sidearm I suggest is the

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.060 
damage and the sidearm I suggest is the
handguns<00:00:47.539> because<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.989> takes<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.590> while<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.770> get

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
handguns because it takes a while to get

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.520 
handguns because it takes a while to get
your<00:00:49.219> sidearm<00:00:49.730> out<00:00:49.910> if<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.600> do<00:00:50.989> have<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.350> bring

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
your sidearm out if you do have to bring

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.520 
your sidearm out if you do have to bring
out<00:00:51.969> now<00:00:52.969> my<00:00:53.420> favorite<00:00:53.870> attachment<00:00:54.109> is

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
out now my favorite attachment is

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.990 
out now my favorite attachment is
usually<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.949> red<00:00:55.100> dot<00:00:55.309> sight<00:00:55.550> just<00:00:55.850> because

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
usually the red dot sight just because

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.270 
usually the red dot sight just because
of<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.180> bad<00:00:56.359> iron<00:00:56.690> sights<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.859> usually

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
of the bad iron sights and I usually

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.369 
of the bad iron sights and I usually
roll<00:00:58.489> with<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.820> sleight-of-hand<00:00:59.149> Pro<00:00:59.930> for

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
roll with the sleight-of-hand Pro for

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.099 
roll with the sleight-of-hand Pro for
the<00:01:00.440> faster<00:01:00.800> abs<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.460> reload<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.690> stopping

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
the faster abs and reload the stopping

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.549 
the faster abs and reload the stopping
power

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
power

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.200 
power
just<00:01:03.890> because<00:01:04.250> I'm<00:01:04.580> comfortable<00:01:05.060> with

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
just because I'm comfortable with

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.700 
just because I'm comfortable with
stopping<00:01:05.450> power<00:01:05.690> it<00:01:05.900> doesn't<00:01:06.200> necessarily

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
stopping power it doesn't necessarily

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.280 
stopping power it doesn't necessarily
need<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.330> commando<00:01:08.330> just<00:01:08.660> if<00:01:08.900> I<00:01:09.050> get<00:01:09.230> in

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
need it and commando just if I get in

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.100 
need it and commando just if I get in
those<00:01:09.440> close<00:01:09.890> situations<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:11.270> gives<00:01:11.660> me<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> bit

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
those close situations it gives me a bit

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.650 
those close situations it gives me a bit
of<00:01:12.140> security<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.700> gun<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.390> want<00:01:14.570> to

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
of security now this gun you want to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.080 
of security now this gun you want to
consider<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.320> attachments<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.490> science<00:01:16.910> is

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
consider the attachments the science is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.850 
consider the attachments the science is
another<00:01:17.360> discrepancy<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:18.290> lets<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:18.620> gun

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
another discrepancy that lets this gun

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.550 
another discrepancy that lets this gun
down<00:01:19.070> quite<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.430> bit<00:01:20.140> although<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.380> does

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
down quite a bit although it does

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.440 
down quite a bit although it does
suppress<00:01:22.010> your<00:01:22.190> gun<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.730> hide<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.150> muzzle

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
suppress your gun and hide the muzzle

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.090 
suppress your gun and hide the muzzle
flash<00:01:23.480> you<00:01:23.810> still<00:01:24.110> appeal<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.590> radar<00:01:24.980> as<00:01:25.070> a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
flash you still appeal on the radar as a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.920 
flash you still appeal on the radar as a
red<00:01:25.340> dot<00:01:25.490> when<00:01:25.850> using<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.510> don't<00:01:26.780> suggest

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
red dot when using it so I don't suggest

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.720 
red dot when using it so I don't suggest
using<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.650> at<00:01:27.770> all

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
using it at all

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.630 
using it at all
my<00:01:29.090> second<00:01:29.930> class<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.560> would<00:01:30.620> suggest<00:01:30.980> is<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
my second class I would suggest is the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.410 
my second class I would suggest is the
blinged<00:01:32.360> out<00:01:32.650> hardline<00:01:33.650> method<00:01:34.610> basically

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
blinged out hardline method basically

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.710 
blinged out hardline method basically
very<00:01:36.080> similar<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.710> first<00:01:36.920> one<00:01:37.070> but<00:01:38.030> always

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
very similar to the first one but always

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.570 
very similar to the first one but always
suggesting<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.530> red<00:01:39.680> dot<00:01:39.890> sight<00:01:40.160> simply

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
suggesting the red dot sight simply

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.030 
suggesting the red dot sight simply
because<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.840> eye<00:01:41.870> sights<00:01:42.350> are<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:42.620> terrible

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
because the eye sights are so terrible

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.130 
because the eye sights are so terrible
and<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.400> grip<00:01:43.580> just<00:01:43.610> lowers<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.390> recoil<00:01:44.780> even

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
and the grip just lowers the recoil even

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.600 
and the grip just lowers the recoil even
more<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.560> point<00:01:45.740> where<00:01:45.980> there<00:01:46.130> isn't<00:01:46.310> any

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
more to the point where there isn't any
