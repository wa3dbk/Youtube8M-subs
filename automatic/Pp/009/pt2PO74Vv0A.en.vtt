00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
have found that looks like it might be a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
have found that looks like it might be a
bug<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.410> shift<00:00:58.649> click<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> bucket<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> lava

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
normally the bucket would be there to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020 
normally the bucket would be there to
pick<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> might<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> bug<00:01:04.979> oh<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.820> god

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
feature is with cats they are supposedly

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.350 
feature is with cats they are supposedly
less<00:01:24.180> eager<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.900> jump<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.350> beds<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.950> chess<00:01:26.360> but

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
less eager to jump on beds and chess but

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
less eager to jump on beds and chess but
as<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> do

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
as you can see they still like to do

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.480 
as you can see they still like to do
that<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.240> pretty<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.750> amount<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.340> they

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that a pretty good amount and I they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
that a pretty good amount and I they
also<00:01:32.610> jump<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:32.939> furnaces<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> was

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
also jump on furnaces I think that was

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380 
also jump on furnaces I think that was
probably<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.799> too<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.250> didn't<00:01:35.579> see

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
probably in there too but I didn't see

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.560 
probably in there too but I didn't see
it<00:01:36.540> before<00:01:37.220> one<00:01:38.220> thing<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.060> supposedly

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it before one thing that is supposedly

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.190 
it before one thing that is supposedly
added<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.700> vaguely<00:01:42.060> by<00:01:42.540> Mojang<00:01:42.990> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
added to at very vaguely by Mojang is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.010 
added to at very vaguely by Mojang is
that<00:01:43.439> cats<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.009> less<00:01:44.369> patient<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.720> let's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that cats are now less patient so let's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.520 
that cats are now less patient so let's
see<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.909> stand<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.240> cats<00:01:48.570> normally

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
see if you stand with your cats normally

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.780 
see if you stand with your cats normally
they<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.070> wander<00:01:50.340> off<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
they would kind of wander off a little

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.020 
they would kind of wander off a little
anyways<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
anyways I think but now a lot more so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
anyways I think but now a lot more so
it's<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.840> means<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.439> just

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's I think that means that they just

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's I think that means that they just
kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.430> off<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.820> their<00:01:56.939> own

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
kind of like go off and do their own

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.730 
kind of like go off and do their own
thing<00:01:57.090> until<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> start<00:01:58.170> moving<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.560> think

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
thing until you start moving I think

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.770 
thing until you start moving I think
they're<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.280> come<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.850> let's<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.689> an

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.510 
probably the most important thing added
for<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:36.889> village<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.580> Nova<00:05:37.970> is<00:05:38.210> that

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
for the village and Nova is that

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.070 
for the village and Nova is that
villagers<00:05:40.520> don't<00:05:40.880> mate<00:05:41.120> nearly<00:05:41.509> as<00:05:41.720> much<00:05:41.870> as

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
villagers don't mate nearly as much as

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.430 
villagers don't mate nearly as much as
they<00:05:42.229> did<00:05:42.289> before<00:05:43.250> I<00:05:44.240> had<00:05:44.780> a<00:05:44.810> situation<00:05:45.020> where

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
they did before I had a situation where

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.469 
they did before I had a situation where
they're<00:05:45.590> like<00:05:45.889> packs<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.520> wild<00:05:46.910> babies

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
they're like packs of wild babies

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.810 
they're like packs of wild babies
running<00:05:47.660> around<00:05:47.860> 30<00:05:48.860> deep<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.460> just<00:05:49.550> like

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
running around 30 deep and just like

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.210 
running around 30 deep and just like
playing<00:05:50.660> tag<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.199> terrorizing<00:05:51.770> my<00:05:51.889> village

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
playing tag and terrorizing my village

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.520 
playing tag and terrorizing my village
just<00:05:52.940> because<00:05:53.150> there<00:05:53.330> was<00:05:53.449> no<00:05:53.630> limit<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.350> how

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
just because there was no limit to how

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.620 
just because there was no limit to how
many<00:05:54.590> that<00:05:54.970> babies<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.120> villagers<00:05:56.479> could

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
many that babies the villagers could

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.930 
many that babies the villagers could
make<00:05:56.840> but<00:05:57.590> now<00:05:57.800> that's<00:05:58.009> been<00:05:58.280> capped<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.759> bit

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
make but now that's been capped a bit

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.420 
make but now that's been capped a bit
less<00:05:59.449> significantly<00:06:00.410> so<00:06:01.100> there<00:06:01.250> should<00:06:01.400> be

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
less significantly so there should be

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.000 
less significantly so there should be
way<00:06:01.669> less<00:06:01.850> villagers<00:06:02.389> and<00:06:02.770> there<00:06:03.770> aren't<00:06:03.919> a

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
way less villagers and there aren't a

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.159 
way less villagers and there aren't a
baby's<00:06:04.340> here<00:06:04.729> but<00:06:05.389> that's<00:06:05.810> probably<00:06:06.020> because

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
baby's here but that's probably because

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.110 
baby's here but that's probably because
even<00:06:06.710> with<00:06:06.830> all<00:06:06.949> these<00:06:07.070> doors<00:06:07.370> my<00:06:07.729> villagers

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
even with all these doors my villagers

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.760 
even with all these doors my villagers
do<00:06:08.630> not<00:06:08.810> want<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.050> get<00:06:09.139> busy<00:06:09.289> they<00:06:09.530> just<00:06:09.650> want

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
do not want to get busy they just want

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.250 
do not want to get busy they just want
to<00:06:09.860> jump<00:06:10.039> in<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.340> jungle<00:06:10.729> and<00:06:10.940> go<00:06:11.660> exploring

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
to jump in the jungle and go exploring

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.170 
to jump in the jungle and go exploring
which<00:06:12.830> is<00:06:12.979> not<00:06:13.160> a<00:06:13.220> good<00:06:13.370> thing<00:06:13.669> when<00:06:13.729> you<00:06:13.970> can't

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
using the pre-release snapshot actually

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.200 
using the pre-release snapshot actually
even<00:06:27.620> though<00:06:27.800> scotland<00:06:28.340> is<00:06:28.460> a<00:06:28.610> one<00:06:28.789> point<00:06:28.970> two

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
even though scotland is a one point two

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.810 
even though scotland is a one point two
point<00:06:29.389> four<00:06:29.599> server<00:06:29.930> right<00:06:30.169> now<00:06:30.349> but<00:06:31.220> because

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
point four server right now but because

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.430 
point four server right now but because
i'm<00:06:31.970> doing<00:06:32.270> that<00:06:32.479> most<00:06:33.169> of<00:06:33.259> the<00:06:33.349> other

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
i'm doing that most of the other

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.810 
i'm doing that most of the other
features<00:06:33.800> probably<00:06:34.160> aren't<00:06:34.280> working<00:06:34.610> but<00:06:34.789> i

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
features probably aren't working but i

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.870 
features probably aren't working but i
can<00:06:35.210> pick<00:06:35.720> blocks<00:06:36.050> including<00:06:36.639> portal<00:06:37.639> blocks

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
can pick blocks including portal blocks

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.810 
can pick blocks including portal blocks
which<00:06:38.210> do<00:06:38.570> not<00:06:38.599> stay<00:06:39.080> down<00:06:39.289> for<00:06:39.590> long<00:06:39.650> I<00:06:40.220> wonder

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
which do not stay down for long I wonder

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.189 
which do not stay down for long I wonder
if<00:06:40.880> they<00:06:41.030> if<00:06:41.240> they're<00:06:41.360> on<00:06:41.419> obsidian<00:06:42.050> if

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
if they if they're on obsidian if

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.230 
if they if they're on obsidian if
they'll<00:06:42.380> work<00:06:42.410> nope<00:06:42.919> I<00:06:43.280> might<00:06:43.970> be<00:06:44.060> able<00:06:44.120> to

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
they'll work nope I might be able to

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.270 
they'll work nope I might be able to
build<00:06:44.449> like<00:06:44.630> a<00:06:44.660> bigger<00:06:44.960> obsidian<00:06:45.500> portal<00:06:45.800> but

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
build like a bigger obsidian portal but

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.140 
build like a bigger obsidian portal but
another<00:06:46.520> thing<00:06:46.729> is<00:06:47.090> I<00:06:47.449> picked<00:06:48.440> a<00:06:49.150> silverfish

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
another thing is I picked a silverfish

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.540 
another thing is I picked a silverfish
block<00:06:50.570> one<00:06:50.930> of<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.110> stones<00:06:51.380> that<00:06:51.919> the

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
block one of the stones that the

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.850 
block one of the stones that the
silverfish<00:06:52.820> are<00:06:53.210> hiding<00:06:53.810> in<00:06:53.900> when<00:06:54.590> they<00:06:54.710> go

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
silverfish are hiding in when they go

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.890 
silverfish are hiding in when they go
into<00:06:55.039> normal<00:06:55.460> stone<00:06:55.729> and<00:06:56.000> you<00:06:56.389> can<00:06:56.539> place<00:06:56.720> it

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
into normal stone and you can place it

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.020 
into normal stone and you can place it
and<00:06:57.080> you<00:06:57.289> have<00:06:57.409> the<00:06:57.530> silverfish<00:06:57.800> block<00:06:58.159> now<00:06:58.370> so

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
and you have the silverfish block now so

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.189 
and you have the silverfish block now so
there's<00:06:59.180> a<00:06:59.270> few<00:06:59.300> things<00:06:59.599> that<00:06:59.870> you<00:06:59.930> couldn't

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199

there's a few things that you couldn't
normally<00:07:00.530> get<00:07:01.070> but<00:07:01.699> with<00:07:01.849> block<00:07:02.120> picking

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
normally get but with block picking

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.899 
normally get but with block picking
you're<00:07:02.630> able<00:07:02.930> to<00:07:03.139> this<00:07:04.130> is<00:07:04.280> real<00:07:04.490> quick<00:07:04.729> before
