00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.240
 google has finally updated my 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.860
 editorially nexus 5 up new version 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.049
 android 50 led by 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.049
 So let's see what's so new there. 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.180
 appeared let's start with the lock screen 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.910
 now swipe right opens the application 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.789
 phone left camera and swipe on top 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.619
 responsible for unlocking the device all 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.839
 It works smoothly and at the same time we will see a new 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.699
 we now have an animation of the menu 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.650
 collapses and unfolds 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.419
 another new feature has become 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.700
 the appearance of push notifications right on 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.989
 lock screen before it worked 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.420
 only when installing various 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.610
 applications she moto x review which we 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.219
 filmed not so long ago it is implemented with 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.410
 using active display double tap and you 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.949
 launch the application to which it is attached 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.239
 this is the most notice but that's what's important 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.980
 earlier when locking device 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.750
 incoming notifications could have been 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.030
 open and curtains gaining access to 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.460
 information that is not very desirable 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.379
 share with others from now on I'm you 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.329
 you can choose and notification mode 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.489
 show full notifications 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.439
 hide personal information or not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.600
 do not have to show anymore 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.460
 worry that someone without your 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.799
 knowing miscalculation text message with personal 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.259
 data became interesting to work and 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.240
 face recognition when installing your 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.460
 persons as a kind of password in 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.799
 first time it is scanned for a long time 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.689
 but on subsequent unlocking you 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.030
 don't even notice this very moment 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.549
 scan everything goes quickly and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.729
 painless by the way yet a security 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.710
 now all the data on your smartphone 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.750
 encrypted before encryption automatically 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.460
 could be turned on manually but by 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.369
 reliability it was not the best 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.869
 the google decision itself is recognized by 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.790
 statement company thanks to encryption 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.450
 no one can read data on 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.210
 smartphone 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.399
 even the police and even if it is allowed 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.409
 the court is only the owner of his device 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.329
 pop can give anyone access 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.320
 The video password is now especially 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.210
 as relevant 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.469
 although google also had precedents with 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.170
 personal data transfer 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.580
 so if you are rich and famous 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.530
 put your photos in the bathroom until 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.090
 in it, well, if you want to give 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.690
 smartphone to someone temporary 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 use 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.979
 translate android guest mode in this 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.600
 the case of the man who got the smartphone 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.640
 will not be able to read your message 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.740
 manage accounts and view 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.810
 any information more so he 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.390
 will be able to connect their accounts which 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.460
 not affected your and for home tablet 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.060
 which the whole family uses unequivocally 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.790
 Moscow 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.650
 but there is a simpler option for example 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.510
 you want to give your tablet to a child for 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.070
 games so that he could not 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.640
 switch from one application to 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.320
 other 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.230
 minimize the window or do something else 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.130
 you can include a lock for the game 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.740
 This should go to the settings 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 security and activate the lock 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.730
 then go to the game 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.190
 launch the application overview and press 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.840
 on the pin icon all baby can't 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120
 quit application until click 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.490
 the key combination of which he of course 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.290
 know shortly after unlocking the screen 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.150
 we get to the desktop 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.920
 obviously the first thing you do 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.110
 attention new notification bar icons 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.959
 and new bottom menu buttons 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.430
 they all look nice and fresh especially 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 attentive viewers noticed and 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.300
 changes are related to grouping 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.280
 applications in the folder if earlier they 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.950
 arranged one after another as if 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.900
 angle that is all you could see 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.120
 now they are located strictly friend for 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.340
 friend because of what is not clear what we are there 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.709
 opened but the new panel was 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.560
 more comfortable with your first and down you 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.510
 see the notice date time and icons in 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.550
 In general, as before, if you hold 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.500
 finger down again you will see the menu 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.760
 quick settings in it can be customized 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.100
 brightness enable or disable 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.620
 wireless networks and mobile internet 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.870
 autoturn and stuff by the way again 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.510
 there was a flashlight finally I can like 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.160
 photos while climbing into the cellar camera 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 also changed 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.269
 removes as well as added new ones 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.730
 settings and the whole interface looks like 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.530
 more modern google thought about 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.750
 how to simplify switching devices 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.760
 different modes now you can click on 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.100
 volume button choose between normal 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.170
 bell icon mode or vibro 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.630
 You can also choose the sound for each 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.580
 from notification 0 and disable quite a 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.230
 if everything is not so critical that is 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.230
 options to set the time for example 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.360
 getting up to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.069
 not only for four hours yet 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.519
 sitting at university or standing in 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.769
 traffic jam 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.320
 the application menu is essentially the same 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.160
 except that the design has changed and not 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.169
 the best 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.310
 Previously, the background was transparent and repeated 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.470
 desktop wallpaper 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.630
 in my opinion it's more interesting than just 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.340
 white just not but apparently all for 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.660
 the notorious optimization and increase 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.850
 work time 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.130
 and now my nexus battery 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.169
 really started working longer if 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.970
 before you had enough for about a day then 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.280
 now he can live a day or even 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.380
 more than this just enough to after 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.600
 work quietly sit on the internet and 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.710
 this is without using a new mode 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.300
 energy saving 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.110
 He turns on when the charge level 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.789
 reduced to 5 or 15 percent in total 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.310
 And overall, I liked the new android 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.889
 just concise and comfortable look 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.229
 modern and pretty true icons 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.360
 still too small and flawed 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.220
 someone complains about wi fi who is there on 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.560
 wireless networks and someone out of luck 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.120
 with sound and batteries we have no 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.919
 gaps and the brakes were not for 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.169
 except for one when I could not 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.539
 pin the phone application 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.610
 hung and refused to understand me but I 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.310
 solved this question by rebooting so 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.810
 maybe it makes sense to wait friends 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.910
 drop by for a parcel post 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.830
 put likes leave comments to us 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.720
 really interesting knows what you think and 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.979
 what do you want to share everything 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.979
 gone to listen to the parcel
