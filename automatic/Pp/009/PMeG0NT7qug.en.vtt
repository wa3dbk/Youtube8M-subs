00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.699 
unlike the last case at our view but see
here<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.759> very<00:02:09.239> matte<00:02:09.840> finish<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.319> very

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
here this is very matte finish and very

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.340 
here this is very matte finish and very
slippery<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.730> feels<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.450> good<00:02:12.780> though

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
slippery it feels really good though

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.530 
slippery it feels really good though
it<00:02:13.590> seems<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:14.940> slippery<00:02:15.210> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it seems to be a little slippery and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.150 
it seems to be a little slippery and
here's<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.960> ultra<00:02:16.230> thin<00:02:16.470> air<00:02:16.650> where<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.010> does

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
here's the ultra thin air where it does

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.670 
here's the ultra thin air where it does
not<00:02:17.340> give<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.700> any<00:02:17.730> upfront<00:02:18.180> case<00:02:19.140> protection

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
not give you any upfront case protection

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160 
not give you any upfront case protection
but<00:02:19.890> we'll<00:02:20.130> compare<00:02:20.460> those<00:02:20.670> later<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.050> this

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
but we'll compare those later on in this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.430 
but we'll compare those later on in this
video<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.550> more<00:02:24.240> angles<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.230> see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
video so more angles of this you can see

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.700 
video so more angles of this you can see
how<00:02:25.710> nicely<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.850> cut<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.390> colors<00:02:28.350> very

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
how nicely it is cut the colors very

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.570 
how nicely it is cut the colors very
vibrant<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.960> just<00:02:31.410> feels<00:02:31.830> good<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
vibrant and it just feels good in the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.550 
vibrant and it just feels good in the
hand<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:33.630> worried<00:02:33.990> about<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
hand a little bit worried about the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.520 
hand a little bit worried about the
slipperiness<00:02:35.040> though<00:02:35.460> for<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> matte

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
slipperiness though for it is a matte

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.570 
slipperiness though for it is a matte
finish<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.830> will<00:02:37.980> let<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.220> if<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
finish and I will let you know if that

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.370 
finish and I will let you know if that
becomes<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:39.030> problem<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> does<00:02:40.110> look<00:02:40.140> very

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
becomes a problem but it does look very

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.040 
becomes a problem but it does look very
good<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:44.280> will<00:02:44.490> fit<00:02:44.760> all<00:02:44.910> variations<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
good and this will fit all variations of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.900 
good and this will fit all variations of
the<00:02:46.410> samsung<00:02:46.740> galaxy<00:02:47.100> s3<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.490> every<00:02:47.730> carrier

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the samsung galaxy s3 on every carrier

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.450 
the samsung galaxy s3 on every carrier
since<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> exact<00:02:49.350> same<00:02:49.620> phone<00:02:50.010> so

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
since they are the exact same phone so

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.390 
since they are the exact same phone so
no<00:02:50.820> problems<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.600> ATT<00:02:51.990> verizon<00:02:52.800> or

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
no problems if you have ATT verizon or

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.450 
no problems if you have ATT verizon or
sprint<00:02:53.570> model<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.720> here<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.770> quick<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.250> at

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
sprint model and here is a quick look at

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.670 
sprint model and here is a quick look at
what<00:02:56.490> TPU<00:02:57.210> materials<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.440> very

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
what TPU materials like it is very

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.250 
what TPU materials like it is very
flexible<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.580> you<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.570> see<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.020> very

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
flexible and you can see that is very

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.370 
flexible and you can see that is very
durable<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.220> once<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.910> case<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.570> on<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
durable but once the case is on the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.590 
durable but once the case is on the
phone<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.920> becomes<00:03:05.340> solid<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.180> don't<00:03:06.360> think

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
phone it becomes solid and I don't think

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.910 
phone it becomes solid and I don't think
it's<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.020> problem<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:07.800> kind

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it's going to be a problem on what kind

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.890 
it's going to be a problem on what kind
of<00:03:08.010> material<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.610> made<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> we're<00:03:09.690> right<00:03:09.870> here

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
of material is made of we're right here

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.840 
of material is made of we're right here
is<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.320> ultra<00:03:10.800> thin<00:03:11.010> air<00:03:11.190> which<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.520> harder

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
is the ultra thin air which is a harder

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.780 
is the ultra thin air which is a harder
plastic<00:03:12.170> but<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.830> do<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.550> front

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
plastic but you do not get that front

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.820 
plastic but you do not get that front
protection<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:15.810> kind<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.260> what<00:03:16.620> you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
protection so it's kind of what you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.490 
protection so it's kind of what you
prefer<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:18.990> any<00:03:19.110> questions

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
