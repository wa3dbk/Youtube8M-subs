the<00:00:19.830> first<00:00:20.070> thing<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> want<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> go

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the first thing we want to do is to go

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.099 
the first thing we want to do is to go
ahead<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> probe<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> bars<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> determine

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
ahead and probe the bars to determine

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.859 
ahead and probe the bars to determine
which<00:00:22.560> function<00:00:23.010> each<00:00:23.609> wire<00:00:23.850> carries<00:00:24.269> first

which function each wire carries first

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.970 
which function each wire carries first
thing<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.560> test<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.890> our

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
thing we want to do is to test for our

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
thing we want to do is to test for our
left<00:00:26.189> turn<00:00:26.310> signal<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.390> appears<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.720> be
