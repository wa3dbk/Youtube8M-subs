00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.260
 present 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.260
 if we do not beat the cougars 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.180
 good for you really because they won the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.949
 chivas but you won the bet because 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.720
 a bet very sung in the program 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 of the best transportation with the vero 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.830
 puma and with kimi that is complete and total 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.370
 absolutely chivas and in fact these 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.229
 days let's wash my truck is 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:28.680
 well with china he already needed it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:30.030
 since last year to someone for 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.160
 Thursday for Friday we will be here 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.509
 passing it the collection of the bet and good 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.610
 there are many things that they spoke because 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 there was a lot of information very many 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 returning from a manolo americana yacht 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 sica let's start with the province twitter 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 today which it has been the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.490
 nfl game more dramatic than 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.660
 remember thinking about what happened 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.150
 thinking about what happened yesterday in this 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.830
 green bay match against the five 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.030
 so tomorrow your comments from 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.509
 our twitter account 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.430
 hop low north portion with clam tag 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.010
 lms and I think I do not know right now what to think 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.229
 in some of those games but the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.479
 dramatic that there are several of the nfl others 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.250
 you have to think about that rat we talked about 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.070
 later what I do know is clear 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.840
 that yesterday is one of them 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.340
 definitely wow good bands good 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.350
 because if they wanted a little more than 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.630
 data of all this reason bone could not 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.760
 he could not get better than with the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.500
 crying until cried 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.810
 this was demonstrated by ending the match 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.440
 against parents and children had 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.480
 one of his worst matches in his short 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.239
 race without finished with 14 passes 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.100
 completed in 29 attempts 209 yards and 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.330
 one entry by land and one by air 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.390
 four interceptions 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.299
 that is, there is a subject on the other hand brady had 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.450
 one of his best encounters but so 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.590
 with everything and is ready we have 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.590
 supertazón and today we talk about it 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.500
 thank you very much and start your section 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.530
 favorite and good is rumored to be the day 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.240
 saddest of the year because it's where I 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.580
 I suppose especially for cougars 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.780
 because they lost against the chivas and 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.880
 they think they 're going to win and also because 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 they have not been able to earn the 33 years 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.750
 chivas de guadalajara so I guess 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.370
 that is one is a lung there for the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.930
 pumas as well as to gather for 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.150
 many but one talking about the hammer and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.280
 of what happened yesterday between chivas against 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.910
 pumas here on the fox page x you will be 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.590
 pointed out com 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.760
 there are several notes and good our 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.560
 specialists in the last word 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.970
 they talked about chivas commitment 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.400
 of yesterday's commitment that we know what 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.740
 that have improved I think they did two 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.260
 golazos that is what I told you 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.300
 better around bothering you a bit 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.100
 where the white zone with two players 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.260
 that they had not been able to do it 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.570
 Queen was September 2013 if no 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.220
 I'm wrong without being able to score then 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.130
 I think that yesterday they showed the chivas that 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.080
 do not want to descend it seems that 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.060
 it was just that, that is, beyond 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.220
 that if they obviously play better 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.140
 the cougars did things well and they were 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.270
 more this situation today is that if 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.750
 we lose we go to the last place of the 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.660
 table 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.510
 then we are in danger very much 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.770
 honestly bad for cougars it seems to me that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.050
 still does not end there to tie 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.870
 we will surely see ourselves better in 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.520
 other days but in this situation 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.380
 this is because the truth is that I am 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.550
 happy for chivas because it was against 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.980
 black lions 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.780
 good and others remember to put the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.459
 traffic by dotcom departure and the first 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.730
 he has stolen me because or snot north in the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.730
 twitter 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:33.629
 and that was without absolutely water 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.930
 so it has to be very good in this 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.930
 moment 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.850
 and is waiting for the situation of the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.680
 that we already had another special just 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.720
 of the cheerleaders of the nfl and now pillar 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.580
 Perez and I went to visit nothing more 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.380
 and nothing less than Minnesota we went with 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 the Vikings and with these girls that 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.790
 are really incredible are some 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.110
 legs great hostesses minnesota is 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.180
 incredible let's see the awards to the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.990
 players and they are the pure wave of truth 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.820
 they are so disciplined and they have so 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.470
 good atmosphere in the dressing rooms and with 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.390
 the media that the truth 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.950
 that's why that's why they take place in 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.020
 these teams so important and good and 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.030
 talking about a man that very important 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.400
 the one that has even compared up to 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.110
 joe montana rosa huelva could be 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.030
 story if he wins his second super bowl 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.800
 it required the core back younger to be 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.570
 bicampeón at such a young age the afternoon of 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.910
 yesterday the heart of the children launched 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.250
 four interceptions and still Italy 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.290
 of the stadium as the hero when routing 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.210
 that team to the second dogfish let's see this 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.790
 central note about the man of 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.020
 moment 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.990
 and with us that with William Wilson by 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.110
 tom wilson 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.110
 very well 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.810
 which is obviously central pop and we're going to 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.810

 day 2 of the league bancomer mx and what 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.660

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.890
