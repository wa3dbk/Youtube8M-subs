00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
baby hope she was missing so it was like

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.230

one<00:06:06.229> with<00:06:06.500> me<00:06:06.680> with<00:06:06.919> and<00:06:07.130> one<00:06:07.250> without<00:06:07.430> and<00:06:07.970> we

one with me with and one without and we

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.180 
one with me with and one without and we
thought<00:06:08.479> the<00:06:08.690> one<00:06:08.870> without<00:06:09.020> was<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.620> variant

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
thought the one without was the variant

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.339 
thought the one without was the variant
version<00:06:10.639> but<00:06:11.120> I'm<00:06:11.240> not<00:06:11.449> you<00:06:11.720> know<00:06:11.780> man<00:06:12.320> and
