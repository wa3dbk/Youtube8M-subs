to<00:00:00.120> break<00:00:00.269> down<00:00:00.420> these<00:00:00.659> rocks<00:00:01.079> an<00:00:01.439> interesting

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
to break down these rocks an interesting

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.400 
to break down these rocks an interesting
choice<00:00:02.600> now<00:00:03.600> that's<00:00:04.080> just<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.380> be

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
choice now that's just going to be

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.710 
choice now that's just going to be
expanding<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.160> right<00:00:05.490> which<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:05.970> why<00:00:06.089> you

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
expanding to the right which is why you

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.240 
expanding to the right which is why you
know<00:00:06.839> go<00:00:07.230> back<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.500> cross<00:00:07.649> stick<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.069> base

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
know go back to cross stick in the base

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.000 
know go back to cross stick in the base
to<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.760> bottom<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.389> tasia<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:10.019> that's<00:00:10.860> why

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
to the bottom of tasia like that's why

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.110 
to the bottom of tasia like that's why
it's<00:00:11.160> like<00:00:11.219> such<00:00:11.429> like<00:00:11.460> set<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:11.849> nicely

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
it's like such like set up nicely

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.339 
it's like such like set up nicely
because<00:00:12.360> these<00:00:12.509> herbs<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.900> usually<00:00:13.019> take

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
because these herbs do you usually take

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.650 
because these herbs do you usually take
that<00:00:13.620> corner<00:00:13.889> base<00:00:14.130> but<00:00:14.910> now<00:00:15.059> cutting<00:00:15.450> off

that corner base but now cutting off

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.680 
that corner base but now cutting off
those<00:00:16.049> rocks<00:00:16.580> it's<00:00:17.580> such<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> weird<00:00:17.970> attack<00:00:18.359> Pat

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
going over like how the attack path is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
going over like how the attack path is
now<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.769> weird<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.399> tasia<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.329> he

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
broke down the rocks to the right so he

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
broke down the rocks to the right so he
has<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.790> around<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the problems we haven't really seen

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tease you do a lot of creep clean up in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.969 
tease you do a lot of creep clean up in
a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.110> matches<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.649> has<00:01:19.800> been

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
a lot of these matches it has been

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.190 
a lot of these matches it has been
pretty<00:01:20.100> much<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.729> throat<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.330> ago

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
pretty much going for the throat and ago

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870 
pretty much going for the throat and ago
that's<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.560> much<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.220> ended<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.820> being

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that's very much so what ended up being

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520 
that's very much so what ended up being
the<00:01:24.060> case<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.450> attack<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.990> traina

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the case with this attack but traina

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.290 
the case with this attack but traina
army<00:01:25.830> value<00:01:26.070> farming<00:01:26.369> value<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.789> I<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:27.060> play

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
army value farming value for I to play

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.730 
army value farming value for I to play
at<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.570> point<00:01:27.840> doesn't<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.229> benefit<00:01:28.560> one

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
at this point doesn't really benefit one

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.140 
at this point doesn't really benefit one
or<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> other<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.400> mostly<00:01:29.880> well<00:01:30.030> try<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
or the other it's mostly well try to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
or the other it's mostly well try to
keep<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> economy<00:01:30.900> safe<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.229> sound<00:01:31.409> behind

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
keep that economy safe and sound behind

you somethink know that this backhoes

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
you somethink know that this backhoes
and<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.519> vulnerable<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:06.120> well<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.569> he<00:03:06.630> does

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and be vulnerable as well and he does

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.479 
and be vulnerable as well and he does
have<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.319> eventually<00:03:07.590> clean<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.099> those<00:03:08.220> rocks

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489
