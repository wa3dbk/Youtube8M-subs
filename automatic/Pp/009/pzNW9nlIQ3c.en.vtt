00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
angle or with that amount of power

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460 
angle or with that amount of power
because<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.940> jerk<00:02:39.240> at<00:02:39.450> times<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.960> really

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
because it's a jerk at times it really

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.710

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
foot he can score his right foot with

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.340 
foot he can score his right foot with
the<00:02:44.520> five-star<00:02:45.120> weak<00:02:45.300> foot<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.900> course<00:02:46.230> he's

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
got medium to medium worker it's so he

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.430

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
could possibly be a good thing because

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.680 
could possibly be a good thing because
the<00:03:13.560> corner<00:03:13.830> flags<00:03:14.040> move<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:14.880> wow

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that is so so damn good FIFA 15 but

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.180 
that is so so damn good FIFA 15 but
anyways<00:03:18.330> ever<00:03:18.690> cons<00:03:18.930> strength<00:03:19.650> I'm<00:03:19.830> dribbling

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
anyways ever cons strength I'm dribbling

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.280

so<00:03:20.520> overall<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.120> me<00:03:21.300> he's<00:03:21.660> getting<00:03:21.900> an<00:03:22.080> eight

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so overall for me he's getting an eight

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.650
