00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.980
 many new cats owners are posing 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.320
 the question what filth among the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.000
 eyes of the cat is located this is 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.820
 mostly dried tear fluid 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.260
 and is completely safe as long as that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.180
 eye is not inflamed or 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.230
 otherwise looks weird 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.230
 no reason to worry 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 getting the liquid off is enough 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.240
 Normally a damp best 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.160
 lint-free store 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.900
 some of them are also involved 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.060
 cotton swabs with me that too 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.670
 would be dangerous if you the eye of 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.770
 Cat hurt could use most of the time 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.489
 I keep my forefinger around the crust 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 remove 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.129
 Of course you should check out the before 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.129
 Wash hands thoroughly 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.250
 jerky movements of my katers too 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 avoid putting my hand in it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.290
 neck what on the one hand calms him down and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.940
 on the other hand easily fixed naturally 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.190
 you have to estimate yourself like you 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.890
 Best to handle your favorite 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.210
 in no case should the oriented 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.610
 to force something 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.740
 if your stubentiger is continuous 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.450
 Worth it makes no sense and you 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.450
 should wait another time 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 I show my hangover shortly 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.060
 show fingers can sometimes mind 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.190
 sniff 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.330
 so it does not scare and that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.640
 whole eye 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.140
 Now I try the crust gently 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.599
 but to remove quickly 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.300
 usually it is quite easy but 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.410
 I also need several attempts 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.410
 until everything is gone 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.190
 a few pats for the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.550
 brave patients and then that's it 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.550
 already 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.780
 you should have liked the video 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.260
 I would be very positive feedback 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.260
 in front
