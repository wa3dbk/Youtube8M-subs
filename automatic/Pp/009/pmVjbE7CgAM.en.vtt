this<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.530> ladder<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:45.210> have

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this little ladder right here and I have

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.360 
this little ladder right here and I have
absolutely<00:00:46.260> no<00:00:46.440> idea<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:46.950> even<00:00:46.980> there

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
absolutely no idea that was even there

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.299 
absolutely no idea that was even there
but<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.899> far<00:00:49.230> away<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.530> any<00:00:49.890> type

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
but that's pretty far away from any type

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
but that's pretty far away from any type
of<00:00:51.289> objective<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.410> anything<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.760> far<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of objective or anything so so far the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 
of objective or anything so so far the
biggest<00:00:54.750> choke<00:00:55.079> point<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.559> map<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.890> found

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
biggest choke point on this map I found

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
biggest choke point on this map I found
has<00:00:56.340> been<00:00:56.370> controlling<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.780> ice<00:00:57.960> rink

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

the<00:01:09.540> counter<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.049> try<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> line<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the counter to try to get a line of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.170 
the counter to try to get a line of
sight<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.040> take<00:01:11.310> people<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.970> but

your<00:01:43.350> front<00:01:43.680> flanked<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> left<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.360> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
your front flanked on the left but this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
your front flanked on the left but this
back<00:01:45.780> flank<00:01:46.079> right<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> worry

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
back flank right here is the one I worry

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
back flank right here is the one I worry
about<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.700> most<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
about the most because you can see the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
about the most because you can see the
enemy<00:01:49.229> spawns<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.950> pretty<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.250> like

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
enemy spawns are pretty much like

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
enemy spawns are pretty much like
they'll<00:01:51.030> spawn<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> pretty<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.500> straight

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
they'll spawn a pretty much straight

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
they'll spawn a pretty much straight
ahead<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.369> opposite<00:01:53.700> side<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> ice

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
ahead on the opposite side of the ice

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.749 
ahead on the opposite side of the ice
rink<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:55.950> much<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> best<00:01:56.490> tip

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

because he's a second chance guy he
deserves<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:36.590> balcony<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.650> definitely

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
deserves it but balcony is definitely

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.830 
deserves it but balcony is definitely
the<00:03:38.070> most<00:03:38.190> important<00:03:38.700> role<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.120> map<00:03:39.390> I'm

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the most important role on this map I'm

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.770 
the most important role on this map I'm
yet<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.230> play<00:03:40.470> any<00:03:40.680> objective<00:03:41.070> games<00:03:41.280> I

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
yet to play any objective games I

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.980 
yet to play any objective games I
haven't<00:03:42.780> even<00:03:42.900> played<00:03:43.140> berlin<00:03:43.530> wall<00:03:43.770> yet<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
haven't even played berlin wall yet and

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
haven't even played berlin wall yet and
i'm<00:03:45.990> looking<00:03:46.320> forward<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.530> playing<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.860> but

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
i'm looking forward to playing that but

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.860 
i'm looking forward to playing that but
honestly<00:03:47.310> i<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.790> map<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.090> more<00:03:48.600> geared

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
honestly i think that map is more geared

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.230 
honestly i think that map is more geared
towards<00:03:49.380> objective<00:03:49.860> games<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.550> bet<00:03:51.150> it'd

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
towards objective games like I bet it'd

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.120 
towards objective games like I bet it'd
be<00:03:51.330> really<00:03:51.480> fun<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:52.050> domination<00:03:52.920> and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
be really fun on domination and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.220 
be really fun on domination and
demolition<00:03:53.790> because<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.630> map<00:03:54.780> seemed<00:03:55.020> very

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
demolition because the map seemed very

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.970 
demolition because the map seemed very
big<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.720> mess<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.930> discovery<00:03:58.590> also

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
big and a mess like that discovery also

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.090 
big and a mess like that discovery also
is<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.580> could<00:04:00.150> tell<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.900> really<00:04:01.680> geared

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
is on I could tell that it really geared

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.610 
is on I could tell that it really geared
toward<00:04:02.430> really<00:04:02.880> Long's<00:04:03.120> lines<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.690> sight<00:04:03.900> it's

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
like that because they think that

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.979 
like that because they think that
they're<00:04:11.040> giving<00:04:11.310> towards<00:04:11.760> snipers<00:04:12.270> but
