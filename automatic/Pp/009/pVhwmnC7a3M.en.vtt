00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.019
 hello welcome to pets and characters 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.570
 this short video shows how we give life 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.620
 your pet first you fill our 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.620
 pet form 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.420
 this is a simple questionnaire where 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 communicate your ideas and needs to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.410
 our team of artists 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.310
 they analyze in detail their ideas and 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.009
 begin to sketch concepts for you 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.169
 mascot each artist draws as he thinks 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.150
 what your pet should see adding 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.170
 details and characteristics that define 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.170
 your personality and style 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.650
 with his incredible drawing skills 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.840
 and creativity they turn their idea 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.210
 in something tangible this is the most 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.460
 creative of the entire design process 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.920
 once we have different sketches 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.540
 pets and dotcom characters reviews and 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.110
 corrects aspects that improve the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.110
 character 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670
 we send you the four projects 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.390
 selected for review and their 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.390
 exchanges 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.469
 this is what I could request 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 like the body of sketch one in the 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.030
 head sketch four put it on and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.000
 Do it by relaxed and attractive themes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 they also add a gold watch to their hand 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.759
 here is an artist drawing the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.759
 changes 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.929
 you are able to make changes to the 200 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.359
 as many times as necessary until 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.580
 get the final sketch once ready 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.490
 it's time to move forward 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.200
 the third part is digitalization the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.270
 artists deliver the project to the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.020
 designers who painted the mascot 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.020
 to give it life 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.799
 layer by layer they add contours color and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 shadows that make the pet look 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.780
 great we present you a version 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.369
 digital of the final sketch here you can 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.030
 review and make color changes and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.530
 shadows this is what I could request 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.780
 I want you to eliminate the lines next 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.360
 of your head and paint a lock of hair 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.819
 white on your forelock reduce the color of 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.480
 the beard ravaged the chin paints on the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.350
 robe and slippers with gray tones 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.350
 Our team designs it 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.090
 once again we present the changes 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.630
 this is what they could request I want 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.830
 the blue return coat reduce the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.870
 white tuft something morning 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 you can make these color changes and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.220
 shadow up to three times to generate the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.470
 final design 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.320
 once the pet is determined 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.940
 it's delivery time here we are 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.160
 creating all the final files 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.340
 including vector versions to everything 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.440
 Black color and lines do not worry if 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.270
 you do not know these files you just have to 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.380
 know that these will help you to use your 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.380
 pet anywhere 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.120
 when all the files were designed 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.870
 we organize them in a fit package that 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.870
 It is delivered 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.230
