00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
about game where and we put together an

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.420 
about game where and we put together an
exciting<00:00:51.629> project<00:00:51.840> around<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.219> normally

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
exciting project around it so normally

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
exciting project around it so normally
you<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.210> our<00:00:54.420> middleware<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:54.989> been

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you know our middleware has all been

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
you know our middleware has all been
individual<00:00:55.739> groups<00:00:55.980> creating<00:00:56.340> their<00:00:56.430> own

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
individual groups creating their own

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
individual groups creating their own
technology<00:00:56.789> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.840> bring<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.050> all

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
technology want to bring that all

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
technology want to bring that all
together<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.129> created<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.609> challenge

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
together so we created a challenge

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
together so we created a challenge
within<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.020> months<00:01:01.280> can<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.340> create<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.609> game

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
within two months can we create a game

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.189 
within two months can we create a game
using<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> our<00:01:03.329> middleware<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.080> we

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
using all of our middleware so we

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
using all of our middleware so we
basically<00:01:04.320> put<00:01:04.530> together<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> 10

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
basically put together a about a 10

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.580 
basically put together a about a 10
minute<00:01:06.420> single<00:01:06.750> player<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.500> all

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
minute single player game that's all

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
minute single player game that's all
really<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.010> its<00:01:08.189> integration<00:01:08.670> example<00:01:09.180> right

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
really is its integration example right

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
really is its integration example right
so<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.229> distributing<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> game<00:01:10.950> yet

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so we're not distributing the game yet

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
so we're not distributing the game yet
the<00:01:11.310> public<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.299> just

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
showing how the tools come together we

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
showing how the tools come together we
want<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> challenging<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.060> actually

were you able to overcome by by using
all<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> synergistic<00:01:48.210> products<00:01:49.130> gray<00:01:50.130> by

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
all the synergistic products gray by

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.620 
all the synergistic products gray by
using<00:01:50.399> Unreal<00:01:50.850> Engine<00:01:50.880> 3<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.450> two<00:01:51.540> minutes

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
using Unreal Engine 3 it's two minutes

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.539 
using Unreal Engine 3 it's two minutes
it's<00:01:52.049> an<00:01:52.170> awesome<00:01:52.619> engine<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> box

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it's an awesome engine right of the box

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
it's an awesome engine right of the box
right<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.140> wanted<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
right so but the thing is we wanted to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.170 
right so but the thing is we wanted to
really<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.340> new<00:01:56.460> dynamics<00:01:56.850> around<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
really put some new dynamics around I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.609 
really put some new dynamics around I
want<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.420> add<00:01:57.540> some<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
want to add some I get like the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.899 
want to add some I get like the
population<00:01:59.100> characters<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.640> these<00:01:59.759> new

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
behavioral trees to make these squid

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
behavioral trees to make these squid
minions<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.270> act<00:02:03.540> as

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
minions that we have in the game act as

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.690

what's<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.200> tablet<00:02:41.470> today<00:02:41.680> what<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:41.890> we

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
what's on that tablet today what can we

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130 
what's on that tablet today what can we
see<00:02:42.160> yes<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.120> we're<00:02:43.300> really<00:02:43.720> looking<00:02:43.870> at<00:02:44.080> what

see yes so we're really looking at what
so<00:02:44.500> what's<00:02:44.650> possible<00:02:45.010> with<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.220> new<00:02:45.370> windows

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
so what's possible with the new windows

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600 
so what's possible with the new windows
8<00:02:46.300> coming<00:02:46.600> out<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.930> tablet<00:02:47.680> devices<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.550> we

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
8 coming out and tablet devices so we

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.759 
8 coming out and tablet devices so we
made<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> technology<00:02:49.390> preview<00:02:49.660> about<00:02:50.560> what<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
made a technology preview about what you

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.620 
made a technology preview about what you
can<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.100> with<00:02:51.310> these<00:02:51.400> new<00:02:51.519> devices<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.510> we're

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
can do with these new devices so we're

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.030 
can do with these new devices so we're
calling<00:02:52.840> an<00:02:52.900> FBX<00:02:53.260> share<00:02:53.530> we're<00:02:53.739> pretending

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
calling an FBX share we're pretending

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.380 
calling an FBX share we're pretending
like<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.489> production<00:02:54.760> environment<00:02:54.910> what
