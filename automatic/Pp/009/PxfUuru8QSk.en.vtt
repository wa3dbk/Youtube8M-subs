quick shakedown run on Thursday morning
before<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:03.070> rally<00:01:03.190> but<00:01:04.150> today<00:01:04.570> drained<00:01:05.379> and

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.540 
before the rally but today drained and
road<00:01:06.460> was<00:01:06.610> quite<00:01:06.820> soft<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.770> rotted<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
road was quite soft and rotted and the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.490 
road was quite soft and rotted and the
at<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.150> end<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.360> was<00:01:10.510> in<00:01:10.660> quite<00:01:10.840> bad<00:01:11.050> condition

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
at the end it was in quite bad condition

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.010 
at the end it was in quite bad condition
already<00:01:11.860> so<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.670> didn't<00:01:12.970> test<00:01:13.119> very<00:01:13.510> very<00:01:13.840> many

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
already so we didn't test very very many

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.010 
already so we didn't test very very many
kilometers<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.729> actually<00:01:16.060> i'm<00:01:16.570> happy<00:01:16.900> with

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
kilometers but actually i'm happy with

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.410 
kilometers but actually i'm happy with
my<00:01:17.200> test<00:01:17.619> day<00:01:17.860> because<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.550> speed<00:01:18.790> was<00:01:19.180> there

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
my test day because the speed was there

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.570 
my test day because the speed was there
from<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.930> beginning<00:01:20.140> i<00:01:20.500> would<00:01:20.650> say<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.130> just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
from the beginning i would say and just

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.690 
from the beginning i would say and just
tried<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:23.740> some<00:01:23.920> changes<00:01:24.280> with<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.490> setup

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
tried did some changes with the setup

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.719 
tried did some changes with the setup
not<00:01:25.330> big<00:01:25.540> changes<00:01:25.930> but<00:01:26.080> small<00:01:26.590> changes<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.160> we

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
not big changes but small changes and we

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.109 
not big changes but small changes and we
will<00:01:27.850> still<00:01:28.119> still<00:01:28.780> dry<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:31.000> the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
will still still dry something on the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.020 
will still still dry something on the
shakedown<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:32.369> actually<00:01:33.369> my<00:01:33.640> feeling<00:01:33.970> is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
shakedown and actually my feeling is

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.230 
shakedown and actually my feeling is
much<00:01:34.210> better<00:01:34.479> than<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.860> was<00:01:36.039> in<00:01:36.090> portable<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
much better than it was in portable and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.830 
much better than it was in portable and
in<00:01:37.420> sardinia<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:39.940> good<00:01:40.119> rally<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.600> like

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
in sardinia so this is good rally I like

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.660 
in sardinia so this is good rally I like
it's<00:01:41.140> one<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.410> my<00:01:41.560> favorite<00:01:41.950> ones<00:01:42.160> it's<00:01:42.460> very

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
it's one of my favorite ones it's very

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.660 
it's one of my favorite ones it's very
similar<00:01:42.910> dystonia<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:45.310> think<00:01:45.520> off<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
similar dystonia and and I think off the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.400 
similar dystonia and and I think off the
shakedown<00:01:46.210> I<00:01:46.600> should<00:01:46.810> be<00:01:46.930> ready<00:01:47.080> for<00:01:47.289> the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
shakedown I should be ready for the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.440 
shakedown I should be ready for the
rally

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:24.990 

me

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.060
