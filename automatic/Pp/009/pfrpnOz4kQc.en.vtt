00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
think it was a total of four league

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
think it was a total of four league
matches<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.450> we're<00:01:27.750> three<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
matches so right now we're three and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
matches so right now we're three and
three<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.460> three<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
three but we're actually what three and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
three but we're actually what three and
seven<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.799> every<00:01:32.400> single<00:01:32.549> wins

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
seven so you know every single wins

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480 
seven so you know every single wins
important<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.720> point<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.189> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
important at this point and you know we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.859 
important at this point and you know we
really<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> start<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> our<00:01:36.479> matches

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
