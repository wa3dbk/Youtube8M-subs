00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.480
 Peru took the first step for the 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.190
 development of the aeronautical industry 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.260
 national maintenance service 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.849
 Air Force presented the two models of 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.270
 plane that will be manufactured in our 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.270
 country 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.180
 and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 it is called antarki which is the first plane 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 with a Peruvian stamp that will soon be 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.840
 incorporated into the training of pilots of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.800
 the air force is a designed aircraft 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.930
 clearly for primary instruction 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 that is to learn to fly 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.030
 for the students and he's just going to want the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.129
 experience of being able to fly 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.559
 These are designed certificate 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.809
 which it has safely 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.580
 that outperform many airplanes this 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.260
 segment not of this error in your 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.940
 construction intervened 11 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.220
 Service specialists 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.170
 maintenance of the professional fab and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.600
 technicians who traveled to canada to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 assemble all parts of the plane the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 staff that went to canada has more than 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.280
 20 years working as tourists 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.380
 Avionics and the speaker is 30 years old 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 of service I am a specialist my 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 specialty industrial engineer the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 main feature of this 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 aircraft is its low cost of operation and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.820
 can become a platform 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.729
 air for other services is 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.950
 consuming 5.5 gallons of fuel 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.619
 per hour 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.719
 which represents tremendous savings in the 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.969
 primary education phase in alliance 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.340
 with the university wings peruvian the fab 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.939
 join this year six aircraft with 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.770
 these characteristics and in the year 2014 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.770
 will begin the co-production of 20 aircraft 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.069
 Here you 1p in partnership with the company 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.770
 Korean korea aerospace industries let's go 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.009
 to manufacture parts for these aircraft 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.869
 let's do sub assemblies and the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.229
 final assembly with the tests 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.239
 end of the aircraft in the country the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.340
 new fleet will partly cover the demand 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.739
 to instruct more students in strength 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.870
 and show that in Peru 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.400
 they can do very good things and compete 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.400
 internationally
