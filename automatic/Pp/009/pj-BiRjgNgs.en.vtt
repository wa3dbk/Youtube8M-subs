00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.049
 in 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.150
 there are beings they are unconscious and 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.539
 there are beings who have a conscience 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.580
 awakening brings them 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.810
 sensitivity for example you have 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.730
 many men and women on the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.220
 head because of the generalized culture 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.440
 today in our civilizations which 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.620
 are still quite a cult level 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.419
 of all this philosophy you have a 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.059
 unconsciousness you have a lot of men 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.440
 who do not know they think they 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.270
 are not aware that they have spent 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.839
 for example my friend where I was at 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.730
 burial 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.260
 he was totally unaware he 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.659
 had thoughts and feelings 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.670
 he was lived by thoughts and 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.069
 feelings but he did not know that he 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.379
 had a capacity of choice he was 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.269
 like a tramp or a tap that has 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.600
 that the choice to feed on leftovers 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.469
 others but he has no choice of 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.870
 choose his food and in the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.519
 thoughts it's the same we eat leftovers 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.890
 we are unconscious or we have the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.460
 choice then one is aware then one is going 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.550
 to choose 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.680
 we will create kossyam in expenses and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.440
 feelings moods will influence 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.160
 on his life on his destiny we know it or 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.080
 do not know if you do not know it is 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.940
 unconscious if we know it becomes 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.400
 conscious is not because we know a 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.270
 thing in the thought that we are 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.310
 aware 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.030
 you do not master the whole of life 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.150
 that's it and your soul will go through the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.220
 sun at hand and at some point 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.910
 everything will be written but meaningless that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.820
 you participate and then you start 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.280
 to lose our strength in this world there the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.740
 pictures start at 7.1 you start to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.210
 want something else you 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.259
 start to see that you did the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.520
 turn this question and you're ready 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.750
 and in the end you fall asleep 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.039
 you can but it's still you 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.800
 because watching is very disturbing 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.380
 what I'm telling you here is to meditate 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.780
 we agree that it's just a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 introduction 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.489
 otherwise you put me in weakness 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.370
 but I tell you look it was you 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.570
 who were learning to walk but when 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.670
 you learned to walk 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.660
 you've been taught to walk a certain 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.640
 way it's beings that have you 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.900
 learned to walk 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
 they taught you to walk with 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.340
 affinity 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.920
 they put a writing on you and they 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:44.049
 have connected you to alliances with 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:46.329
 worlds no man walks alone 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.400
 he walks with a world it's a world 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.730
 who walks through 3 it's a world 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.500
 who speaks through you but where 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:01.810
 is unconscious if we are unaware 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.560
 it is no longer my destiny so here is 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.160
 the Essenes we want to restore 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.030
 all these steps of the friend do not have 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.070
 all this knowledge 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.459
 okay it's not in perfection 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.380
 but we say that this knowledge must be 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.160
 restored and that there must be a 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.250
 education 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.700
 this young for example 1 he has arrived 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.799
 in a family that was already in charge 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.600
 he had no chance of escaping 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.830
 and realize his mission of the sun 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.200
 what should help him 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.300
 education, that is, education 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.350
 that is to say the state yes but the state 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.600
 what was he thinking of doing 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.160
 money that's all the state has used 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.150
 of this of this young man to say is 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.920
 what are you in bus or are you 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.470
 not profitable and we will train you 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.330
 to say that we are actually going to use a 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.860
 world who will use street but what name 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
 who he is in what intention 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.310
 does he know the secrets of the 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.320
 life is it going to be a wise is this 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.240
 that governments are wise is 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.980
 what these beings are wise is this 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.510
 that they are ruled for our interests 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.340
 true ie is it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.340
 only the interest of the physical body 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.200
 we are not going at all to another culture 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.830
 we say we're grown it's the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.500
 Planet of the Apes but there is no 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.660
 culture culture this art to finance 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.060
 something something going to 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.650
 up to greatness towards peace in 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.920
 mastery of every moment 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.400
 look at for example the war and the 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.520
 war degenerated degenerate now 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.750
 it's parity we see women 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.500
 before sending a woman to war but 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.940
 it was amazing it was 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.590
 it was really the end it was over 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.420
 no one to whom sent there 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.540
 now we put so much in 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.250
 a technology with weapons 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.450
 sophisticated we talked about war 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.380
 surgical did you go there 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.670
 to go see again and surgical war 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.230
 you know tic species 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.120
 completely stupid who are in the 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.470
 video games 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.470
 still more value of life 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:15.730
 is destined and soul 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:20.020
 it's very beautiful ladies world to my friend 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.020
 friendship we feel expanded
