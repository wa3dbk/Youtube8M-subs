that come back to this message tab but

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.789 
that come back to this message tab but
that's<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.930> work<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.619> you're

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's just a lot of work so if you're

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.649

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
on the screen and you just need a little

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
on the screen and you just need a little
bit<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.929> extra<00:01:10.140> reading<00:01:10.560> room<00:01:10.829> you<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.219> tap<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
bit of extra reading room you just tap a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.300 
bit of extra reading room you just tap a
bubble<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.270> keyboard<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:13.289> go<00:01:13.499> away<00:01:13.649> now

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.959 
I have noticed that when you tap it
again<00:01:16.319> you<00:01:16.530> could<00:01:16.679> even<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.759> little

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
again you could even make the little

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.539 
again you could even make the little
venue<00:01:18.479> away<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.679> underneath<00:01:20.219> near
