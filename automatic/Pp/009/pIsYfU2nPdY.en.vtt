00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.059
 in its environment 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.679
 on the other side of the network 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.679

 match or a mix of things 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.439
 from an experience that I had 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.939

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.419
 surrounded by a completely hostile environment 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.259
 like an egg shell 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.729
 it was very easy for him 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.319
