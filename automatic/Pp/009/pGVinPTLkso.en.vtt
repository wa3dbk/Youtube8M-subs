secondly<00:00:06.980> during<00:00:08.030> depolarization<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.480> find

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
secondly during depolarization we find

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
secondly during depolarization we find
there<00:00:10.049> are<00:00:10.080> three<00:00:11.630> vectors<00:00:12.630> but<00:00:13.530> during

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
there are three vectors but during

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160 
there are three vectors but during
repolarization<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.820> making<00:00:15.089> only<00:00:15.240> one

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
repolarization we are making only one

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.730 
repolarization we are making only one
vector<00:00:16.379> why<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:17.790> reason<00:00:18.150> being

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
vector why the reason being

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.380 
vector why the reason being
depolarization<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.890> fast<00:00:20.310> process<00:00:20.640> but

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
depolarization is a fast process but

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.499 
depolarization is a fast process but
repolarization<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.349> slow<00:00:23.220> process<00:00:23.509> because

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
repolarization is a slow process because

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.900 
repolarization is a slow process because
sodium<00:00:24.840> channels<00:00:25.230> are<00:00:25.320> fast<00:00:25.950> channels<00:00:26.369> but

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
sodium channels are fast channels but

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
sodium channels are fast channels but
potassium<00:00:27.480> channels<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.410> fast

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
potassium channels are not that fast

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.519 
potassium channels are not that fast
so<00:00:29.489> again<00:00:29.700> listen<00:00:30.469> depolarization<00:00:31.469> occurs

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
so again listen depolarization occurs

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.530 
so again listen depolarization occurs
fastly<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.460> reposition<00:00:33.210> occurs<00:00:33.420> gradually

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
fastly and reposition occurs gradually

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.040 
fastly and reposition occurs gradually
is<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:36.239> depolarization

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
is there right now when depolarization

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.729 
is there right now when depolarization
is<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
is going on

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
is going on
Sceptile<00:00:38.460> depolarization<00:00:39.350> suddenly<00:00:40.350> occur

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
Sceptile depolarization suddenly occur

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.529 
Sceptile depolarization suddenly occur
and<00:00:40.800> complete<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.850> major<00:00:42.120> ventricular

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
and complete then major ventricular

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.299 
and complete then major ventricular
depolarization<00:00:42.960> come<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.589> when<00:00:44.070> major

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
depolarization come and when major

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.919 
depolarization come and when major
ventricular<00:00:44.699> depolarization<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.449> completed

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
ventricular depolarization is completed

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.180 
ventricular depolarization is completed
then<00:00:46.140> basel<00:00:46.469> ventricular<00:00:46.800> depolarization

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
then basel ventricular depolarization

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.340 
then basel ventricular depolarization
come<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.239> depolarizing<00:00:49.050> vector<00:00:49.379> septum<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
come so depolarizing vector septum and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.979 
come so depolarizing vector septum and
major<00:00:52.350> part<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> basal<00:00:53.190> part<00:00:53.429> are<00:00:53.989> recognized

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
major part and basal part are recognized

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
major part and basal part are recognized
by<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> needle<00:00:55.649> independently<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.969> three

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
by the needle independently so three

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
by the needle independently so three
independent<00:00:57.569> waves<00:00:58.019> are<00:00:58.230> made<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:59.249> is<00:00:59.339> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
independent waves are made this is a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
independent waves are made this is a
right<00:00:59.579> emmaclaire<00:01:00.390> again<00:01:01.170> let<00:01:01.409> us<00:01:01.499> come<00:01:01.620> back

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
right emmaclaire again let us come back

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.739 
right emmaclaire again let us come back
to<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.069> diagram<00:01:02.300> there<00:01:03.300> during<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
to this diagram there during the

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.740 
to this diagram there during the
repolarization<00:01:04.580> septum<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> sorry<00:01:06.450> during

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
repolarization septum is sorry during

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
repolarization septum is sorry during
the<00:01:06.900> depolarization<00:01:07.850> depolarization<00:01:08.850> septum

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the depolarization depolarization septum

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.540 
the depolarization depolarization septum
is<00:01:09.330> depolarize<00:01:09.780> first<00:01:10.100> major<00:01:11.100> part<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
is depolarize first major part is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.200 
is depolarize first major part is
depolarized

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
depolarized

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.860 
depolarized
and<00:01:12.440> lastly<00:01:13.460> basel<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:15.090> g<00:01:15.270> position<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
and lastly basel because g position is a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.170 
and lastly basel because g position is a
fast<00:01:16.200> process<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.250> first<00:01:17.820> step<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.120> any

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
fast process so first step to any

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
fast process so first step to any
position<00:01:18.390> completes<00:01:19.020> then<00:01:19.820> vector<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
position completes then vector is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.790 
position completes then vector is
produced<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.600> major<00:01:21.810> manipular<00:01:22.260> deposition

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
produced for major manipular deposition

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.710 
produced for major manipular deposition
and<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.400> rapidly<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> vector<00:01:24.300> is<00:01:24.390> complete

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and very rapidly this vector is complete

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.050 
and very rapidly this vector is complete
and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.290> basal<00:01:25.560> vectors<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:25.980> produced<00:01:26.340> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and then basal vectors are produced is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.900 
and then basal vectors are produced is
the<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> machine<00:01:28.410> will<00:01:28.650> sense<00:01:28.950> septal

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
the right so machine will sense septal

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.270 
the right so machine will sense septal
vectors<00:01:30.810> major<00:01:31.410> ventricular<00:01:31.950> depolarization

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
vectors major ventricular depolarization

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.430 
vectors major ventricular depolarization
vector<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> Whizzer<00:01:33.300> vectors<00:01:33.720> independent

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
vector and Whizzer vectors independent

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.130 
vector and Whizzer vectors independent
of<00:01:34.530> each<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.550> draw<00:01:36.140> three

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
of each other so it will draw three

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.190 
of each other so it will draw three

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
not finished it's again repolarization

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
not finished it's again repolarization
is<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> slow<00:01:49.380> process

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
is a slow process

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.800 
is a slow process
when<00:01:50.610> septum<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.180> started<00:01:51.600> its

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
and and it has not finished basal
repolarization<00:02:00.780> start<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.800> because<00:02:02.190> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
repolarization start so because the

repolarization start so because the
repolarization<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.030> slow<00:02:03.240> process<00:02:03.690> so

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
repolarization is a slow process so

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.050 
repolarization is a slow process so

repolarization is a moderate speed

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.680 
repolarization is a moderate speed
process<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.620> needle<00:03:55.980> will<00:03:56.160> move<00:03:56.690> fast

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
process so needle will move fast

very strong electrical activity so

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.619 
very strong electrical activity so
atrial<00:07:17.270> repolarization<00:07:17.689> is<00:07:18.080> masked<00:07:19.509> it<00:07:20.509> is

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:20.629 
atrial repolarization is masked it is

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.659 
atrial repolarization is masked it is
covered<00:07:20.990> and<00:07:21.229> it<00:07:21.889> is<00:07:21.919> unable<00:07:22.219> to<00:07:22.279> move<00:07:22.610> the

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669 
covered and it is unable to move the

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.670 
covered and it is unable to move the
needle<00:07:22.909> independently<00:07:23.749> so<00:07:24.139> atrial

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
needle independently so atrial

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.089 
needle independently so atrial
repolarization<00:07:25.219> is<00:07:25.849> not<00:07:26.659> presented<00:07:27.499> during

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:28.099 
repolarization is not presented during

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:33.219 
repolarization is not presented during
the<00:07:28.309> ECG<00:07:29.559> tracing<00:07:30.849> these<00:07:31.849> are<00:07:32.029> right<00:07:32.209> so<00:07:33.050> what

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229 
the ECG tracing these are right so what

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.920 
the ECG tracing these are right so what
we<00:07:33.349> have<00:07:33.469> done<00:07:33.620> in<00:07:33.800> all<00:07:34.039> this<00:07:34.279> lecture<00:07:34.930> again

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
we have done in all this lecture again

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.619 
we have done in all this lecture again
listen<00:07:36.349> we<00:07:36.979> have<00:07:37.129> done<00:07:37.309> number<00:07:37.639> one<00:07:37.819> during

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:38.629 
listen we have done number one during

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:40.329 
listen we have done number one during
one<00:07:38.779> cardiac<00:07:39.139> cycle<00:07:39.559> what<00:07:40.039> are<00:07:40.219> the
