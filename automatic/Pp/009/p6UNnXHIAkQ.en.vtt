00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 well hello to all and all 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.680
 flavors and today we find ourselves 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.260
 for a little man boxing video is 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.630
 obvious that I had ordered to do 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.230
 my little bit of time and then I love 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 ma on to the cardboard box because in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.590
 makes the paper totally torn my 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.359
 related by rain etc 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.650
 but suddenly to withdraw first I 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.369
 not expect that on a box 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:37.100
 cardboard also miserable so that's it 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:39.980
 go see now how did I take 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 a thesis protection 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.660
 that's red because I like it 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.559
 red plus it's all sweet these movies 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 of kerbonne franches-mountains and 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 then we will act out the most 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 important it was expected very honest 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.730
 that I like and obviously the brand like 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 you fake it here so we do not care 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.520
 it's not finished your chrome buttons 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 it's seydou but at the same time 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.180
 it's remembered it's sure I've put 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 two phosphorescent sticks proved that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.020
 it was good but I let the button 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.369
 Here basic suddenly I changed 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.009
 buttons then baled them by 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.009
 Besides the guarantee of stuff here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.009
 so that's moaning peel the two 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 red 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:45.080
 because it's good to then then we 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.619
 will go to the pole is jaime trigger 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.250
 purple trigger so it's too good 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.350
 because it's super convenient and I have 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.450
 put down there actually it was not the one 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:10.319
 that I had put I was expecting it 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:14.239
 will look at the investigated so which ones 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.239
 I had a chance 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.800
 I had us both xxl collectors 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.680
 which cost me 30 euros anyway for 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.390
 to have room in fact that's not it 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.280
 help this collector pixels but that's 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.200
 still millions it can take even 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.470
 Boukerche theme will be able to modify it in 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.850
 buying others but suddenly that's it 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.820
 more than I like it is that I 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.209
 I'm not if you'll see there but here 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.480
 we wrote pearn controllers it's enough 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:53.370
 easy when you can see I put 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.600
 color also dollars a sum 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.250
 slow and because I thought it was going 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.989
 super come with the theme in addition to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.030
 edges and the chrome one has to get 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:06.780
 press and his lands I put a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:10.070
 write the writers then down 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.300
 I think I said everything I think 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.380
 we feel that I wait they go 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.739
 surely check yes no the paddle 7 to 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.180
 the back I better believe more round 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.430
 because otherwise it really listened to him 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.100
 really too expensive then suddenly I got 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.230
 believe more round that change the price 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.940
 so suddenly it's the cross key here 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:40.350
 heron here what is he going to say to 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.850
 side of l2 this is my low day power 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.660
 we're all done now I'm going 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.690
 can also say some info from 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.100
 infos as there you will see that precisely 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.420
 I will also do a little dry 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.360
 on the newzbin stuff that is with xp 49 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:03.400
 so I'm a little bit wise with him 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.570
 which will be a channel on info etc and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.460
 once I was in a presentation 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.810
 of several currencies all there will be my 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.260
 joystick and many more basic 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.780
 etc. 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.410
 we can see the differences and then 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.690
 here 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.049
 and then also what is great 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.740
 is that it comes back or whatever 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:28.120
 do not need to force that for that 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.010
 does a good thing I hope these 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.770
 small boxing needles you will have liked 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.630
 do not hesitate to subscribe to the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.960
 chain 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:44.919
 and then for the curious by the joystick 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:47.860
 in itself bore exactly 127 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.230
 euros 92 the demand is in itself 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.890
 plus summer to other taxes and fees 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.120
 it cost me 161 euros which you 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.250
 frankly I hope that sam is 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.100
 profitable otherwise I think I'm going 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.370
 to be a little upset and suddenly they have 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:08.440
 been crossed he puts driving zones 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:13.240
 there is a catch is I do not know where he 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.210
 is but come back this is me so and 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.610
 20 low cost and I will repeat myself 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.590
 do not hesitate to subscribe to the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.070
 chain left a small lake a little 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:29.280
 blue thumb and then bah we are left 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.660
 for a next video when I have 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.240
 on the ming muse chain and then 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.540
 sometimes on the public channel n 7 7 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.280
 I'm going to do a fight with him on this 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:46.290
 that she says ghost and then we form 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:48.449
 a series on minecraft here is eba has more 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.139
 at 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.139
 ciao
