surprised at how much this tablet moved
just<00:00:16.289> by<00:00:16.500> these<00:00:16.710> door<00:00:16.949> speakers<00:00:17.340> alone<00:00:18.170> um

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
just by these door speakers alone um

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.519 
just by these door speakers alone um
basically<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:20.130> I've<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.970> uh<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.380> is

basically what I've got here uh this is
a<00:00:22.560> Ford<00:00:23.130> f-150<00:00:23.699> extended<00:00:24.150> cab<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.029> I've<00:00:27.029> got

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
a Ford f-150 extended cab and I've got

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.749 
a Ford f-150 extended cab and I've got
pioneer<00:00:29.359> TSD<00:00:30.359> 680<00:00:30.929> r2s<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.579> their

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
pioneer TSD 680 r2s which is their

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.139 
pioneer TSD 680 r2s which is their
higher<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.920> pretty<00:00:34.920> much<00:00:35.100> their<00:00:35.460> highest<00:00:35.910> end

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
higher and pretty much their highest end

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.170 
higher and pretty much their highest end
before<00:00:36.930> their<00:00:37.500> stage<00:00:38.070> 4<00:00:38.840> speakers<00:00:39.840> uh<00:00:40.760> Co<00:00:41.760> axes

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
before their stage 4 speakers uh Co axes

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.250 
before their stage 4 speakers uh Co axes
and<00:00:42.530> I've<00:00:43.530> got<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> MB<00:00:44.250> cortar<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> 480<00:00:45.660> point<00:00:46.020> 4

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and I've got a MB cortar a 480 point 4

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799 
and I've got a MB cortar a 480 point 4
which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> 60<00:00:47.399> watts<00:00:47.610> per<00:00:47.850> channel<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.420> 4<00:00:48.629> ohms

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
which is 60 watts per channel at 4 ohms

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.220 
which is 60 watts per channel at 4 ohms
and<00:00:49.520> I'm<00:00:50.520> sure<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.789> doesn't<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.449> rated<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.960> 12

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and I'm sure it doesn't do rated at 12

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.860 
and I'm sure it doesn't do rated at 12
volts<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.070> till<00:00:53.579> probably<00:00:53.879> getting<00:00:54.300> 50<00:00:54.629> watts

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
volts but till probably getting 50 watts

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.189 
volts but till probably getting 50 watts
per<00:00:55.140> speaker<00:00:55.399> something<00:00:56.399> close<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
per speaker something close to that and

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
per speaker something close to that and
it<00:00:58.199> basically<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.949> mid<00:00:59.190> bass<00:00:59.370> um<00:01:00.149> it's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it basically just some mid bass um it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.580 
it basically just some mid bass um it's
not<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> sound<00:01:01.020> clean<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
not going to sound clean on the
