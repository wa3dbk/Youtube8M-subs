00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.530
 tree 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.019
 as a garden a lot of color 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.480
 does it have real colors on your gear and 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.919
 then I have a very favorite one 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.199
 plant and that is the primula 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.489
 so the prima paradiso that has quite 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.349
 I have lots of flowers that I love 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.119
 long flowering so much that he is 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.529
 can even have a little force 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.899
 order the judge early in the season 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.059
 is there and can come to hefty is it 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.349
 no problem the ones that survived perfectly 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.000
 Then you have to imagine that there is a nice one 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.289
 colorful mix of makes like this too 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.539
 get up then you are right that 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.949
 spring feeling down garden 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.690
 I'm going to have a nice country look 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.380
 so therefore also have in the basket 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.329
 used 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.040
 there is foil and under the foil if you 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.600
 make its own holes in it there 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 as very important for us get 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.660
 if the rain that really starts with 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.190
 a lap pool is created and the likes in 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.230
 he likes it for one 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.880
 little stand I can stay moist 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.739
 the partial shade 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.690
 also do this well if you are going to plant 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.280
 then I always put it whole or something 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.719
 diagonally in the pot, making the leaves already 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.089
 hang a little more over the edge and 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.399
 immediately felt like you 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.079
 baker has been standing for a long time and what I am going to do 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.270
 I am going to make a nice colorful mix 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.590
 she is going well is slanted next to i can 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.359
 of course he completely filled it up 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.319
 this way I want a somewhat rural 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.969
 going to make 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.459
 I will do I will make you a combination 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.009
 also with some very weird ones I will 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.810
 slightly more in the middle like that 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.240
 and what you also get is that he what 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.079
 looks less compact in no time because 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.179
 that hedra 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.549
 continue between the plants and then I 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.560
 something more aside from the friends to this one 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.520
 what I am going to do then is no 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.679
 source further 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
 look at a light yellow me one too 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.170
 very nice color as well as the fun of it 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.159
 those primulas 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.990
 Paradiso that are very many 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.119
 you want to get different colors 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.709
 make a really nice and colorful mix 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.770
 I love that 8 may be aware hera shy 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.630
 then this guy with moss for x it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.369
 spring is mine 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.859
 you get some flour that the birds in it 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.209
 and lay the kobe garden for you 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.770
 then it like there to a 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.979
 birdhouse when using 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.419
 I'm just going to be right here in the middle 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.169
 which slightly slanted a little 

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:03.849
 playful 

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:04.430
 may look a bit hungry for a moment 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.010
 was watching 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.200
 nice is a little more backwards me 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.180
 like him but i missed something like you 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.560
 now look then you see that he is something too 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.300
 has become compact and I want because 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 playful love as well as to the trijntgen 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.900
 look then you see bouquets but also 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.980
 a piece that makes you scratch it 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.870
 on a branch in it making it a 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.820
 is going to be airy as it is now 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.100
 I did on the branch from the garden 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.450
 achieved 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.380
 so and I put it here at the front 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.030
 there 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.209
 that brings you some height but I give 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.380
 also some more air on the whole 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.630
 there you can also here in the front and 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.959
 he does not always necessarily have to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.060
 high stand out ecologically 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.280
 I would side here may 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.690
 it in between 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.150
 so and then you see that you are beautiful 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.190
 airy appearance it just gets 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.840
 nose outside you have a beautiful beauty 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.820
 scale and if you say so myself 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.830
 think it is a shame to put on a terrace 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.720
 He can also fine beds would then 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.550
 a cooler place nice and light and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.920
 give enough water then it does inside 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.970
 also great inside or outside 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.330
 but with me he goes out there with me 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.330
 concerned
