them in and lip liner is a really
important<00:00:39.329> step<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.719> want<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:40.140> lips<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
important step if you want your lips to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
important step if you want your lips to
look<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:41.070> defined<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.050> long-lasting

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
look really defined and long-lasting

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.190 
look really defined and long-lasting
which<00:00:43.559> i<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.190> crucial<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.750> bold<00:00:46.020> lip

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
which i think is crucial for a bold lip

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
which i think is crucial for a bold lip
because<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.920> don't<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.280> sloppy<00:00:47.520> clown<00:00:47.910> lips

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
because you don't want sloppy clown lips

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
because you don't want sloppy clown lips
so<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.350> careful<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.920> lining<00:00:50.219> your

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so be really careful when lining your

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
so be really careful when lining your
lips<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.930> tend<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> rub<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.440> lips<00:00:52.620> together<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.240 
colors I've done this with a deep red as
the<00:02:20.180> main<00:02:20.450> color<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.440> purple<00:02:21.799> at<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> very

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
the main color and a purple at the very

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.670 
the main color and a purple at the very
corners<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.420> creates<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.140> very<00:02:24.380> similar

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
corners and it creates a very similar

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.509 
corners and it creates a very similar
effect<00:02:29.320> going<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:30.769> little<00:02:30.950> finger<00:02:31.160> i
