for<00:00:16.610> many<00:00:16.820> years<00:00:17.090> stands<00:00:17.600> for<00:00:17.930> small<00:00:18.650> speakers

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
for many years stands for small speakers

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.429 
for many years stands for small speakers
has<00:00:19.250> always<00:00:19.430> been<00:00:19.790> an<00:00:20.330> aluminium<00:00:20.570> tube<00:00:21.140> on<00:00:21.410> a

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
has always been an aluminium tube on a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.160 
has always been an aluminium tube on a
steel<00:00:22.040> tube<00:00:22.310> very<00:00:22.670> hairy<00:00:22.970> often<00:00:23.480> sand-filled

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
steel tube very hairy often sand-filled

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.040 
steel tube very hairy often sand-filled
and<00:00:24.550> my<00:00:25.550> feeling<00:00:26.000> was<00:00:26.150> that<00:00:26.419> every<00:00:26.599> time<00:00:26.810> I<00:00:26.840> put

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
and my feeling was that every time I put

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.380 
and my feeling was that every time I put
a<00:00:27.079> speaker<00:00:27.410> on<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:28.040> kind<00:00:28.310> of<00:00:28.369> stance<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:29.210> was

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
a speaker on that kind of stance it was

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.839 
a speaker on that kind of stance it was
drained<00:00:29.720> from<00:00:29.960> energy<00:00:30.310> so<00:00:31.310> when<00:00:31.520> designing

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
drained from energy so when designing

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.610 
drained from energy so when designing
the<00:00:32.060> stand<00:00:32.329> I<00:00:32.540> was<00:00:32.720> aiming<00:00:33.170> for<00:00:33.380> a<00:00:33.440> very

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
the stand I was aiming for a very

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.220 
the stand I was aiming for a very
lightweight<00:00:33.890> design<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:35.510> was<00:00:35.660> aiming<00:00:36.170> for

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
lightweight design and I was aiming for

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.229 
lightweight design and I was aiming for
a<00:00:36.440> structure<00:00:36.829> that<00:00:37.040> did<00:00:37.190> not<00:00:37.340> assault<00:00:37.670> energy

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
a structure that did not assault energy

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.650 
a structure that did not assault energy
because<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.320> may<00:00:40.250> ask<00:00:40.460> yourself<00:00:40.640> if<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:41.450> have

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
because you may ask yourself if you have

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.840 
because you may ask yourself if you have
something<00:00:41.930> that's<00:00:42.109> highly<00:00:42.559> absorbent<00:00:43.219> what

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
something that's highly absorbent what

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.599 
something that's highly absorbent what
is<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.210> it's<00:00:44.390> absorbing<00:00:45.109> it's<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.920> music<00:00:46.370> and

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
is it it's absorbing it's a music and

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.490 
is it it's absorbing it's a music and
you<00:00:46.730> don't<00:00:46.940> want<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.239> music<00:00:47.390> absorbed<00:00:48.050> you

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
you don't want the music absorbed you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.799 
you don't want the music absorbed you
want<00:00:48.679> it<00:00:48.769> out<00:00:48.859> in<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.100> room<00:00:49.329> that<00:00:50.329> was<00:00:50.539> one<00:00:50.690> of

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
want it out in the room that was one of

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.689 
want it out in the room that was one of
the<00:00:50.870> reasons<00:00:51.260> why<00:00:51.379> we<00:00:51.559> created<00:00:52.160> this<00:00:52.399> stand

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
the reasons why we created this stand

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.970 
the reasons why we created this stand
it's<00:00:53.570> very<00:00:53.780> lightweight<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.379> does<00:00:54.530> not<00:00:54.679> store

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
it's very lightweight it does not store

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.160 
it's very lightweight it does not store
energy<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.550> when<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.210> have<00:00:56.359> energy<00:00:56.750> storage

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
energy and when you have energy storage

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.340 
energy and when you have energy storage
in<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.500> system<00:00:57.920> high<00:00:58.399> mass<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:59.600> energy<00:01:00.140> is

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
in a system high mass that energy is

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.420 
in a system high mass that energy is
maybe<00:01:01.210> stored<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.079> will<00:01:03.289> go<00:01:03.649> back<00:01:03.859> up<00:01:04.100> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
maybe stored but it will go back up and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.580 
maybe stored but it will go back up and
that's<00:01:05.330> why<00:01:05.510> we<00:01:05.660> have<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.900> decoupling<00:01:06.290> we

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
that's why we have the decoupling we

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.830 
that's why we have the decoupling we
have<00:01:06.740> they<00:01:06.950> work<00:01:07.310> as<00:01:07.580> mechanical<00:01:08.120> diodes<00:01:08.540> so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
have they work as mechanical diodes so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.810 
have they work as mechanical diodes so
you<00:01:08.930> only<00:01:09.200> have<00:01:09.350> energy<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.980> energy<00:01:10.370> flow<00:01:10.550> one

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you only have energy the energy flow one

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.149 
you only have energy the energy flow one
way<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.930> there's<00:01:12.080> two<00:01:12.290> layers<00:01:12.440> of<00:01:12.770> decoupling

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
way and there's two layers of decoupling

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.680 
way and there's two layers of decoupling
here<00:01:13.580> all<00:01:13.790> with<00:01:14.570> balls<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:16.390> they<00:01:17.390> are<00:01:17.450> placed

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
here all with balls and they are placed

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.930 
here all with balls and they are placed
in<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.960> corners<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.620> speaker<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.220> when

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
in the corners of the speaker and when

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.820 
in the corners of the speaker and when
you<00:01:20.030> have<00:01:20.210> something<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.350> corners<00:01:21.800> that

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
you have something in the corners that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.530 
you have something in the corners that
is<00:01:22.160> actually<00:01:22.550> where<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.760> speaker<00:01:23.270> is<00:01:23.300> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
is actually where the speaker is the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.810 
is actually where the speaker is the
stiffest<00:01:23.810> because<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.500> have<00:01:24.650> three<00:01:25.640> walls

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
stiffest because you have three walls

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.730 
stiffest because you have three walls
meeting<00:01:26.480> so<00:01:26.690> we<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> very<00:01:27.230> very<00:01:27.470> stiff

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
meeting so we have a very very stiff

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.470 
meeting so we have a very very stiff
thing<00:01:27.980> you<00:01:28.160> cannot<00:01:28.400> have<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.640> lot<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:28.880> vibration

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
thing you cannot have a lot of vibration

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.240 
thing you cannot have a lot of vibration
there<00:01:29.690> so<00:01:30.230> that's<00:01:30.440> why<00:01:30.620> we<00:01:30.770> hang<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.220> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
there so that's why we hang it in the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.730 
there so that's why we hang it in the
corner<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.480> is<00:01:32.600> why<00:01:32.780> not<00:01:33.260> much<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.650> the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
corner and that is why not much of the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.370 
corner and that is why not much of the
energy<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.640> speaker<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:35.570> actually<00:01:35.900> pushed

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
energy in the speaker is actually pushed

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.280 
energy in the speaker is actually pushed
down<00:01:36.560> understand<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.370> when<00:01:38.300> you<00:01:38.420> take<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
down understand and when you take the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.850 
down understand and when you take the
stand<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.480> replace<00:01:41.480> this<00:01:41.740> put<00:01:42.740> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
stand and you you replace this put the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.410 
stand and you you replace this put the
speaker<00:01:43.160> on<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.370> different<00:01:43.820> stand<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.240> will

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
speaker on a different stand you will

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.090 
speaker on a different stand you will
immediately<00:01:44.990> notice<00:01:45.440> how<00:01:45.770> everything

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
immediately notice how everything

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.300 
immediately notice how everything
collapses<00:01:46.730> how<00:01:46.910> everything<00:01:47.390> slows<00:01:47.600> down<00:01:48.310> so

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
collapses how everything slows down so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.580 
collapses how everything slows down so
it<00:01:49.400> works

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.609 

the<00:01:54.710> same<00:01:54.890> way<00:01:55.100> they<00:01:55.340> are<00:01:55.369> mechanically<00:01:56.270> tuned

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
the same way they are mechanically tuned

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.440 
the same way they are mechanically tuned
acoustical<00:01:57.619> resonators<00:01:58.340> when<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.060> when<00:01:59.329> you

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
acoustical resonators when you when you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.569 
acoustical resonators when you when you
have<00:01:59.630> something<00:01:59.869> like<00:02:00.049> decoupling<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:01.219> a

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
have something like decoupling on a

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.969 
have something like decoupling on a
piece<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.090> electronics<00:02:02.750> they<00:02:03.439> work<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.799> same

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
piece of electronics they work the same

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.399 
piece of electronics they work the same
way<00:02:04.009> people<00:02:05.000> think<00:02:05.179> that's<00:02:05.450> isolation<00:02:06.229> you

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
way people think that's isolation you

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.290 
way people think that's isolation you
have<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.770> isolate<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.549> equipment<00:02:07.969> from<00:02:08.149> the

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
have to isolate the equipment from the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.449 
have to isolate the equipment from the
environment<00:02:08.539> but<00:02:09.500> actually<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.009> most<00:02:10.190> noise

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
environment but actually the most noise

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.119 
environment but actually the most noise
is<00:02:10.849> inside<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.629> equipment<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.709> what<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:12.980> want

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
is inside the equipment so what you want

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.650 
is inside the equipment so what you want
to<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.519> you<00:02:13.670> want<00:02:13.879> to<00:02:13.940> create<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.269> control

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
to do is you want to create a control

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.750 
to do is you want to create a control
path<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.260> vibration<00:02:15.830> out<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.160> your<00:02:16.310> equipment

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
path of vibration out of your equipment

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.280 
path of vibration out of your equipment
that's<00:02:17.450> how<00:02:17.629> they<00:02:17.810> work

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.380 

if<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.769> spikes<00:02:24.189> and<00:02:24.549> you<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.150> wooden

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
if you have spikes and you have wooden

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.119 
if you have spikes and you have wooden
floors<00:02:25.719> and<00:02:26.049> carpets<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.650> stuff<00:02:26.799> like<00:02:26.950> that

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
floors and carpets and stuff like that

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.920 
floors and carpets and stuff like that
is<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.640> actually<00:02:27.969> attach<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.569> speaker

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
is that you actually attach the speaker

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.160 
is that you actually attach the speaker
to<00:02:29.109> their<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.920> their<00:02:30.069> living<00:02:30.519> room<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.939> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
to their to their living room and that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.099 
to their to their living room and that
means<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.379> you<00:02:32.530> add<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.739> lot<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.159> mass<00:02:33.370> and

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
means that you add a lot of mass and

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.619 
means that you add a lot of mass and
that<00:02:35.109> that<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.760> very<00:02:37.120> good<00:02:37.269> way<00:02:37.450> because

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
that that is not a very good way because

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.390 
that that is not a very good way because
the<00:02:37.900> vibrations<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.530> put<00:02:38.769> down<00:02:38.950> into<00:02:39.159> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
the vibrations you put down into the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.099 
the vibrations you put down into the
floor<00:02:39.640> will<00:02:39.909> go<00:02:40.060> up<00:02:40.269> in<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> speaker<00:02:40.780> again

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
floor will go up in the speaker again

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.160 
floor will go up in the speaker again
you<00:02:41.650> may<00:02:41.829> not<00:02:42.069> be<00:02:42.220> able<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.599> measure<00:02:43.599> different

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
you may not be able to measure different

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.760 
you may not be able to measure different
but<00:02:44.859> you<00:02:44.950> will<00:02:45.099> hear<00:02:45.280> difference

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.830 

you
