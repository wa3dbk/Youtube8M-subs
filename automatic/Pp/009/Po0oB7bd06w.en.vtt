00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
confused about that that means is out of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.009 
confused about that that means is out of
100<00:00:28.830> baby<00:00:29.039> girls<00:00:29.279> her<00:00:29.429> age<00:00:29.609> she<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.900> than

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
100 baby girls her age she was more than

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
100 baby girls her age she was more than
nine<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.349> them<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.009> she's<00:00:32.579> definitely<00:00:33.030> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
nine of them so she's definitely it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
nine of them so she's definitely it's
still<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> peanut<00:00:33.690> her<00:00:33.870> doctor<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.320> worried

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
still a peanut her doctor is not worried

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.979 
still a peanut her doctor is not worried
at<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.070> she's<00:00:35.370> growing

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
at all because she's growing

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.060 
at all because she's growing
consistently<00:00:36.989> she's<00:00:37.260> growing<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.739> her<00:00:37.890> own

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
consistently she's growing on her own

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
consistently she's growing on her own
little<00:00:38.340> curb<00:00:38.520> even<00:00:38.910> though<00:00:39.000> she<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
little curb even though she is of a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
little curb even though she is of a
smaller<00:00:39.840> side<00:00:40.110> she's<00:00:40.739> growing<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> guess

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
smaller side she's growing and I guess

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.860 
smaller side she's growing and I guess
that's<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.940> look<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.690> don't

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that's what they look for they don't

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.330 
that's what they look for they don't
really<00:00:43.079> look<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.680> oh<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> be

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
really look for like oh you have to be

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.100 
really look for like oh you have to be
this<00:00:44.789> height<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.390> weight<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.930> age

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
this height and this weight at this age

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
this height and this weight at this age
they<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.649> look<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.219> consistency<00:00:47.700> her

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
they just look for consistency her

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
they just look for consistency her
length<00:00:48.780> she's<00:00:49.289> 24<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> half<00:00:50.100> inches<00:00:50.370> which

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
length she's 24 and a half inches which

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.100 
length she's 24 and a half inches which
is<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> 26th<00:00:51.809> percentile<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.710> then<00:00:53.399> her<00:00:53.640> head

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
is the 26th percentile and then her head

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
is the 26th percentile and then her head
was<00:00:55.110> thirty<00:00:55.379> nine<00:00:55.649> centimeters<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.520> believe

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
was thirty nine centimeters I believe

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
was thirty nine centimeters I believe
and<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> forgot<00:00:57.710> what<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> percent<00:00:59.129> o<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.430> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and I forgot what the percent o is for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
and I forgot what the percent o is for
that<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.300> 15<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.020> she<00:01:01.649> did

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that I think it was like 15 so she did

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.119 
that I think it was like 15 so she did
get<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.160> shots<00:01:02.489> she<00:01:03.059> got<00:01:03.270> three<00:01:04.049> shots<00:01:04.799> and
