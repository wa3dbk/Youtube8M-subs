00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 in a previous day we saw how to install a control domain in the network 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.970
 we want to know how you can download a device 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.999
 that domain 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.859
 because by default the equipment 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.520
 they are still 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.540
 or if you do not commit independent minds despite the fact that they are the republic 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.630
 uncontrolled domain 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.820
 the first in cÃ¡ceres 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.820
 configure the network card of each of the two 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450
 here because we want to add to the domain 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.450
 and put an ip 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.780
 of team 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.930
 with the same luck in which this one 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.150
 the server 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.399
 with a reference 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160
 as real zero point 1 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 I see with zero with all 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 man if we have a dhcp server 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.450
 it would be automatic since we see congealed ccpa Serbian assets 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.960
 this case would be the one that I have a few computers and could put the sip is loved 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.900
 It is important that here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.770
 let's put 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.440
 twenty 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.960
 from the web server 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.490
 dms that in this case is still the same computer qinetiq directory 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.420
 it is not a simple case in which 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 the domain controller is also a dns server 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.020
 but if we do not put taco grow like this it will work for us 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.300
 our computer has to look serious to measure itself to see where it is 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.960
 the domain control information so 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.070
 as I say we put an ip 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.320
 that is not the same miniopera comptroller is part of your network 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.780
 and here we can the domain controller ip conceived in that which is the same 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.000
 in this case 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.360
 we accept 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 and with this we get that the villagers fear the same domain that 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 the server can check it to be sure 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.330
 we make an end 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.150
 the order to check the activity 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.290
 of computers 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.290
 We have you start the ip of the pipeline server answer us 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 thing that is doing 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.459
 patient spent that day 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.599
 add this equipment the domain that's why the properties are made my pc 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.919
 team name change 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.559
 let's also take advantage of a team but important 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.639
 we put the domain 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.639
 we recreated in 2003 directors 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.589
 we sang 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.589
 they ask us for the password and name 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.739
 the table of 2003 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.609
 It still will not accept 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.599
 add this type the domain 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.079
 he has already done it 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.079
 we must resign 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.249
 while the computer restarts we can see what 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.359
 in 2003 it was registered 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.999
 how it started 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.669
 programs again 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.669
 the goal is excessive and better teams 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.819
 and in the folder that 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.699
 freecom pietersz to appear 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.409
 the team and what are you waiting for us to add 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.780
 this process would be repeated for all teams that if this our domain 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 if we have a list of equipment of our company 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.559
 in these teams now it could already enter like the wari or the soils that has been 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:30.329
 created 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.439
 how are these users like 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.779
 our example 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.919
 the user the loans approve without the xp 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.919
 we can enter as guests 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.459
 xp has already been restarted 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.459
 and now we enter 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.469
 by username here you have to be careful because 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.319
 thus eliminated 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.479
 entry like the previous one but 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.709
 so sure is the one that we want to enter the kino domain in team 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.479
 yes this team takeoff would like to enter 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.379
 with their own team waiting 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.339
 how they were tearing my boy 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.189
 this is the right thing 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.750
 if you want it will enter nec domain choose the domain name 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.379
 cecy put 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.389
 the name and password that we have put this user 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.370
 remember that you are not entering with the credentials that I created in 2003 the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.860
 domain 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.930
 if I want to enter as a user of the local team 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.810
 he wanted 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.860
 this option 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 if he will still let us in 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370
 that this is happening was ready added to the domain 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.110
 here 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.629
 we can enter because we know what to tell them that I adore 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:53.470
 pink 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.559
 provided 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:57.259
 these two
