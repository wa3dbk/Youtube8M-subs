hello everyone welcome back to part two

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.030 
hello everyone welcome back to part two
and<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.540> conclusion<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.140> replay<00:00:04.410> now

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
and the conclusion of this replay now

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.130 
and the conclusion of this replay now
strelok<00:00:05.520> now<00:00:05.730> getting<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.210> 32<00:00:06.629> harvesters<00:00:07.109> and

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
strelok now getting of 32 harvesters and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.870 
strelok now getting of 32 harvesters and
also<00:00:07.710> mining<00:00:08.160> out<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.700> natural

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
also mining out of this natural

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.700 
also mining out of this natural
expansion<00:00:09.240> or<00:00:09.750> out<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.440> his<00:00:10.559> natural

expansion or out of his natural

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.440 
expansion or out of his natural
expansion<00:00:11.040> as<00:00:11.280> well<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> definite

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
expansion as well so a definite

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.930 
expansion as well so a definite
difference<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.290> terms<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.620> minerals<00:00:13.980> almost<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
difference in terms of minerals almost a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.640 
difference in terms of minerals almost a
thousand<00:00:15.420> minerals<00:00:15.750> triple<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> difference

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
thousand minerals triple the difference

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.880 
thousand minerals triple the difference
between<00:00:16.800> horror<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.109> horror<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.380> strelok<00:00:19.740> so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
between horror and horror and strelok so

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.380 
between horror and horror and strelok so
I'm<00:00:19.980> assuming<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.580> horror<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I'm assuming that horror is going to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.029 
I'm assuming that horror is going to
lose<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.750> game<00:00:21.900> unless<00:00:22.199> he's<00:00:22.439> able<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.769> start

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
lose this game unless he's able to start
