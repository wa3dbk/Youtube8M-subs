00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is where it goes to because it's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.830 
is where it goes to because it's
connected<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.530> both<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.920> carburetor<00:01:59.490> and

front which has a little drain on the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.580 
front which has a little drain on the
bottom<00:02:09.300> you'll<00:02:09.420> plug<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.020> pull<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bottom you'll plug you can pull out and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.200 
bottom you'll plug you can pull out and
drain<00:02:10.770> some<00:02:11.150> some

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210

are is for a float Bowl event if you

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.280 
are is for a float Bowl event if you
plug<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.800> up<00:03:22.860> your<00:03:23.850> float<00:03:24.780> Bowl<00:03:24.990> can't

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
plug this up your float Bowl can't

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.930 
plug this up your float Bowl can't
equalize<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.860> pressure<00:03:26.010> when<00:03:26.370> more<00:03:26.760> gas

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
equalize the pressure when more gas

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.960 
equalize the pressure when more gas
comes<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.980> won't<00:03:29.160> get<00:03:29.310> any<00:03:29.490> gas<00:03:29.640> your

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
comes in so you won't get any gas your

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.300 
comes in so you won't get any gas your
bike<00:03:30.120> will<00:03:30.300> die<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:31.770> need<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> leave<00:03:32.130> those

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
bike will die you need to leave those

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.560 
bike will die you need to leave those
open<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.790> free<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.120> clear<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.390> any

open and free and clear of any

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.470 
open and free and clear of any
obstruction<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.190> when<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:36.120> float<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
obstruction so that when the float the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.960 
obstruction so that when the float the
gas<00:03:36.660> level<00:03:36.990> does<00:03:37.170> go<00:03:37.350> down<00:03:37.380> more<00:03:38.370> gas<00:03:38.580> gets

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
gas level does go down more gas gets

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.920 
gas level does go down more gas gets
pulled<00:03:39.240> in<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:40.050> floats<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.530> come<00:03:40.710> up<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.930> yeah

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
pulled in the floats can come up so yeah

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.660 
pulled in the floats can come up so yeah
crucial<00:03:43.500> leave<00:03:43.650> those<00:03:43.800> open<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.250> go<00:03:44.400> over<00:03:44.550> that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
crucial leave those open I go over that
