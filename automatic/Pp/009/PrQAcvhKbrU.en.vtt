using the little filter that came with

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.540 
using the little filter that came with
it<00:00:10.250> so<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.580> ended<00:00:11.760> up<00:00:11.880> purchasing<00:00:13.160> sand<00:00:14.160> filter

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550

it so we ended up purchasing sand filter
from<00:00:15.240> Walmart<00:00:15.720> I<00:00:15.930> believe<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.769> is<00:00:16.829> the<00:00:17.099> 14

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:17.429 
from Walmart I believe this is the 14

inch<00:00:17.609> hose<00:00:17.909> like<00:00:18.060> 55<00:00:18.480> pound<00:00:18.720> Sam<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.949> is

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
inch hose like 55 pound Sam which is

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.640 
inch hose like 55 pound Sam which is
plenty<00:00:20.369> big<00:00:20.400> enough<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.570> six<00:00:22.050> fifteen

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
plenty big enough it's like six fifteen

plenty big enough it's like six fifteen
sixteen<00:00:23.069> hundred<00:00:23.509> gallons<00:00:24.509> per<00:00:24.659> hour<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> this

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
sixteen hundred gallons per hour so this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.220 
sixteen hundred gallons per hour so this
pool<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.599> three<00:00:27.810> thousand<00:00:28.199> gallons

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
pool here is like three thousand gallons

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.739 
pool here is like three thousand gallons
so<00:00:28.679> we<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.949> run<00:00:29.399> it<00:00:29.429> two<00:00:29.669> hours<00:00:29.999> a<00:00:30.029> day<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
so we can run it two hours a day and it

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.080 
so we can run it two hours a day and it
filters<00:00:30.989> it<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:31.349> no<00:00:31.529> problem<00:00:31.699> kind<00:00:32.699> of<00:00:32.850> set<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
filters it out no problem kind of set it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.110 
filters it out no problem kind of set it
on<00:00:33.180> four<00:00:33.420> hours<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.109> sure<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
you can use the motor you do not have to

you can use the motor you do not have to
have<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.340> adapter<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.440> made<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> small

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
have that adapter I made a small

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.799 
have that adapter I made a small
modification<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.149> makes<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
modification to it which makes it a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.160 
modification to it which makes it a
little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.350> more<00:00:49.920> efficient<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.660> big

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
little bit more efficient with the big

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.389 
little bit more efficient with the big
piece<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.649> nothing<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> definitely

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
piece which nothing is definitely

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.720 
piece which nothing is definitely
required<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> engine<00:00:55.920> quarter<00:00:56.309> return

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
required is the engine quarter return

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.419 
required is the engine quarter return
that<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.179> here<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:58.409> obviously<00:00:58.949> too<00:00:59.159> small

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
that was here just obviously too small

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.919 
that was here just obviously too small
for<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> two-inch<00:01:01.370> return<00:01:02.659> that's<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.809> one

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
for the two-inch return that's the one

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.500 
for the two-inch return that's the one
that<00:01:04.080> comes<00:01:04.230> with<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.270> ended<00:01:06.360> up

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that comes with it so I just ended up

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
that comes with it so I just ended up
taking<00:01:06.690> an<00:01:06.870> exacto<00:01:07.260> knife<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.620> just<00:01:07.940> put<00:01:08.940> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
taking an exacto knife and just put it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510 
taking an exacto knife and just put it
up<00:01:09.120> there<00:01:09.150> traced<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.950> just<00:01:10.950> cut<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.280> out

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
up there traced it and just cut it out

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.690 
up there traced it and just cut it out
it<00:01:11.730> fits<00:01:11.910> perfectly<00:01:12.360> no<00:01:12.840> leaks<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.320> great

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it fits perfectly no leaks it's great

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.469 
it fits perfectly no leaks it's great
this<00:01:14.700> piece<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.340 

the<00:01:19.020> valve<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.560> closes<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the valve that closes it so that is the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
the valve that closes it so that is the
piece<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.890> used<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:25.159> there<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.970> came

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
piece that used to be there they came

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.960 
piece that used to be there they came
with<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> works

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
with it now we have that so that works

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.109 
with it now we have that so that works
out<00:01:30.119> perfectly<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.399> did<00:01:32.399> order<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> those

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
coming and I had it hooked up just like

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.419 
coming and I had it hooked up just like
this<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.530> don't<00:01:52.679> plug<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> hook

this you just don't plug it in you hook

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.820 
this you just don't plug it in you hook
it<00:01:53.550> up<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.819> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:53.970> working<00:01:54.330> fine<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:54.869> ended<00:01:55.770> up

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
it up and it was working fine I ended up

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.749 
it up and it was working fine I ended up
making<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.280> change<00:01:57.830> where<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:58.860> took<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> actual

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
making a change where I took the actual

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.480 
making a change where I took the actual
motor<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.539> so<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.679> this<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.190> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
motor out so all this is this is just a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.440 
motor out so all this is this is just a
magnet<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:05.450> propeller

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
magnet and then this is your propeller

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.789 
magnet and then this is your propeller
or<00:02:06.600> whatever<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.080> want<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.289> call<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.649> that's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799

or something you know could possibly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
the flow of water coming through so it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
the flow of water coming through so it
works<00:02:35.640> fine<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.299> now<00:02:36.420> since<00:02:36.900> I've<00:02:37.049> got<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
works fine for now since I've got the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.949 
works fine for now since I've got the
adapter<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:37.829> already<00:02:38.070> bought<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.359> from<00:02:39.359> Amazon

I'm<00:02:40.109> just<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.380> go<00:02:40.500> ahead<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.799> use<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
I'm just going to go ahead and use it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.180 
I'm just going to go ahead and use it
anyway<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.079> way<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.470> hooked<00:02:43.709> up<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
anyway but the way it's hooked up it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.310 
anyway but the way it's hooked up it
goes<00:02:44.310> from<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.549> two<00:02:44.730> inch<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.870> an<00:02:45.989> inch<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.230> a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
goes from the two inch to an inch and a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.130 
goes from the two inch to an inch and a
quarter<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:47.120> I'm<00:02:48.120> using<00:02:48.299> one<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.660> adapters

quarter as I'm using one of the adapters
that<00:02:49.410> came<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.160> pool<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:51.600> got<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that came with the pool it's got a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.110 
that came with the pool it's got a
little<00:02:51.870> bit<00:02:52.019> mud<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.790> all<00:02:53.910> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
little bit mud on it there so all that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.849 
little bit mud on it there so all that
does<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.079> had<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> had

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
does this is one I had here when I had

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.819 
does this is one I had here when I had
it<00:02:55.950> hooked<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:57.510> piece<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.049> just<00:02:58.620> hooks

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
it hooked up this piece here just hooks

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.130 
it hooked up this piece here just hooks
into<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.420> then<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.660> other<00:03:00.900> piece

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
into that and then this other piece

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.000 
into that and then this other piece
hooks<00:03:01.650> onto<00:03:01.890> your<00:03:02.310> inch<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> quarter<00:03:03.299> or

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
hooks onto your inch and a quarter or

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.530 
hooks onto your inch and a quarter or
inch<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> half<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.670> fit<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.209> there<00:03:06.359> too

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
inch and a half will fit in there too

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020 
inch and a half will fit in there too
you<00:03:06.959> tighten<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.350> down<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:08.700> works<00:03:08.850> out

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
you tighten it down and it works out

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.849 
you tighten it down and it works out
this<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.630> put<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.049> piece<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.650> don't

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
this is now put that piece in I don't

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.220 
this is now put that piece in I don't
need<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.250> anymore<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.989> I'm<00:03:12.989> still<00:03:13.200> using

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
need this anymore so I'm still using

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.490 
need this anymore so I'm still using
that<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.829> now<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.519> fairly<00:03:15.060> secure<00:03:15.690> not<00:03:16.350> as

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
that for now it's fairly secure not as

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.979 
that for now it's fairly secure not as
secure<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.250> threaded<00:03:17.819> but<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.870> know

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
secure as you know threaded but you know

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.920 
secure as you know threaded but you know
it<00:03:19.319> works<00:03:19.530> no<00:03:20.100> problem

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
it works no problem

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.980 
it works no problem
so<00:03:21.930> I'll<00:03:22.350> show<00:03:22.709> you

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
so I'll show you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:34.559 
so I'll show you
the<00:03:24.650> flow<00:03:24.950> now

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.080 

it's<00:03:35.019> nearly<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.439> great<00:03:35.950> water<00:03:36.220> flow<00:03:36.549> better

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
it's nearly a great water flow better

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.289 
it's nearly a great water flow better
than<00:03:37.360> before<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.579> can<00:03:39.610> put<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:39.970> piece<00:03:40.120> on

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
than before so you can put that piece on

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.630 
than before so you can put that piece on
air<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.599> actually<00:03:40.989> moves<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.409> whole<00:03:42.840> cooler

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
air it actually moves the whole cooler

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.890 
air it actually moves the whole cooler
which<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.790> great<00:03:46.060> actually<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.569> purchase

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
which is great actually just purchase

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.410 
which is great actually just purchase
that<00:03:47.049> vacuum<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.890> pole<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.239> piece

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
that vacuum and the pole and that piece

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.390 
that vacuum and the pole and that piece
here<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.780> had<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.110> hooked<00:03:50.260> up<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:54.010> can<00:03:54.159> put<00:03:54.310> it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
here I had it hooked up you can put it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.589 
here I had it hooked up you can put it
down<00:03:54.519> inside<00:03:54.879> there<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.299> can<00:03:55.450> actually

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
down inside there and you can actually

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.569 
down inside there and you can actually
run<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.290> vacuum<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.709> way<00:03:56.920> instead<00:03:57.340> of

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
run the vacuum that way instead of

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.130 
run the vacuum that way instead of
having<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.940> disconnect<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.540> those<00:03:59.110> up<00:03:59.319> to

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
having to disconnect this those up to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.930 
having to disconnect this those up to
just<00:04:00.920> take<00:04:01.070> that<00:04:01.220> little<00:04:01.430> piece<00:04:01.520> that<00:04:01.820> came

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
just take that little piece that came

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.610 
just take that little piece that came
with<00:04:02.120> your<00:04:02.270> pool<00:04:02.450> it's<00:04:02.840> floating<00:04:03.260> there<00:04:03.530> at

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
with your pool it's floating there at

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
that exact same piece that just has that

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.960 
that exact same piece that just has that
housing<00:06:02.540> screwed<00:06:02.840> in<00:06:02.930> over<00:06:03.229> it<00:06:03.669> what<00:06:04.669> he<00:06:04.790> ended

housing screwed in over it what he ended

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.440 
housing screwed in over it what he ended
up<00:06:05.060> doing<00:06:05.210> is<00:06:05.389> he<00:06:05.510> took<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.720> 2-inch<00:06:07.210> piece<00:06:08.210> we've

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
up doing is he took a 2-inch piece we've

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.390 
up doing is he took a 2-inch piece we've
made<00:06:08.630> him<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.870> make<00:06:09.020> corn<00:06:09.260> holes<00:06:09.410> cornhole

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
made him to make corn holes cornhole

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.670 
made him to make corn holes cornhole
boards<00:06:11.030> before<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:12.080> he<00:06:12.139> cut<00:06:12.320> a<00:06:12.350> hole<00:06:12.500> in<00:06:12.620> the

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
boards before and he cut a hole in the

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.500 
boards before and he cut a hole in the
bottom<00:06:13.040> so<00:06:13.340> then<00:06:13.460> he's<00:06:13.610> like<00:06:13.760> this<00:06:13.970> piece<00:06:14.150> here

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
bottom so then he's like this piece here

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.770 
bottom so then he's like this piece here
without<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.680> adapter<00:06:16.100> just<00:06:16.940> put<00:06:17.570> it<00:06:17.690> directly

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
without the adapter just put it directly

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.870 
without the adapter just put it directly
on<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.200> bottom<00:06:18.530> now<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.070> do<00:06:19.310> that<00:06:19.340> you<00:06:19.610> have<00:06:19.760> to

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
on the bottom now to do that you have to

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.420 
on the bottom now to do that you have to
grind<00:06:20.560> some<00:06:21.560> of<00:06:21.650> those<00:06:21.770> pieces<00:06:22.039> off<00:06:22.400> the

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
grind some of those pieces off the

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
grind some of those pieces off the
bottom<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.090> it's<00:06:23.240> flat<00:06:23.510> so<00:06:24.880> I<00:06:25.880> still<00:06:26.210> may<00:06:26.330> end

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
bottom so it's flat so I still may end

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.490 
bottom so it's flat so I still may end
up<00:06:26.510> doing<00:06:26.750> that<00:06:26.870> because<00:06:27.080> in<00:06:27.169> that<00:06:27.260> way<00:06:27.320> I've

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
up doing that because in that way I've

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.270 
up doing that because in that way I've
got<00:06:27.680> a<00:06:27.710> two<00:06:27.950> inch<00:06:28.060> Inlet<00:06:29.500> through<00:06:30.500> that<00:06:30.740> basket

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
got a two inch Inlet through that basket

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.740 
got a two inch Inlet through that basket
through<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:31.550> same<00:06:31.729> filter<00:06:32.120> and<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.390> two<00:06:32.570> inch

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
through the same filter and a two inch

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.870 
through the same filter and a two inch
return<00:06:33.110> so<00:06:33.650> it<00:06:33.800> would<00:06:33.950> definitely<00:06:33.979> make<00:06:34.430> it<00:06:34.490> a

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
return so it would definitely make it a

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.130 
return so it would definitely make it a
much<00:06:35.330> cleaner<00:06:35.570> pool<00:06:36.070> so

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
much cleaner pool so

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.370 
much cleaner pool so
got<00:06:39.140> it<00:06:39.260> going<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.780> I've<00:06:41.990> gotten<00:06:42.230> questions

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
got it going and I've gotten questions

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.250 
got it going and I've gotten questions
thanks
