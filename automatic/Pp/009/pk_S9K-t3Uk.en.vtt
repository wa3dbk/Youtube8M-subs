creative<00:00:30.430> circle<00:00:31.430> I<00:00:43.090> thought<00:00:44.090> about<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:44.480> a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
creative circle I thought about this a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
little bit more and I think the trees

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.430 
little bit more and I think the trees
have<00:00:46.970> something<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.510> do<00:00:47.600> with<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:47.900> as<00:00:48.230> well

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
have something to do with it as well
