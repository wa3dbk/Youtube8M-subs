combo<00:01:03.059> fire<00:01:03.420> elements<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.140> power<00:01:04.379> attack<00:01:05.100> on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
combo fire elements of power attack on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.350 
combo fire elements of power attack on
single<00:01:06.180> enemy<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.750> probable<00:01:07.590> injury<00:01:07.950> effect

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
so fire diagonal would be coupled into

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.249 
so fire diagonal would be coupled into
the<00:01:12.540> attack<00:01:13.140> brave<00:01:13.890> burst<00:01:14.189> category<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> what

boost all allies attack for three turns
basically<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.770> same<00:04:13.950> brave<00:04:14.310> birds<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.940> don't

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
basically the same brave birds I don't

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.070 
basically the same brave birds I don't
know<00:04:16.020> if<00:04:16.170> el<00:04:16.530> mirages<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.340> as<00:04:17.430> good<00:04:17.670> as<00:04:17.820> Weiss

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
know if el mirages be as good as Weiss

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.640 
know if el mirages be as good as Weiss
but<00:04:19.080> as<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.340> see<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.820> mirage<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.750> support

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
but as you can see a mirage is a support

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.300 
but as you can see a mirage is a support
type<00:04:22.980> he<00:04:23.640> boosts<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> attack<00:04:24.600> he<00:04:25.140> does<00:04:25.350> not<00:04:25.590> do

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
type he boosts the attack he does not do

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.050 
type he boosts the attack he does not do
an<00:04:26.610> attack<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.390> he<00:04:27.660> does<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:27.960> heal<00:04:28.350> HP<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.820> he

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
an attack and he does not heal HP so he

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.790 
an attack and he does not heal HP so he
boosts<00:04:30.450> our<00:04:30.570> allies<00:04:30.930> attack<00:04:31.230> for<00:04:31.410> three<00:04:31.560> times

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
boosts our allies attack for three times

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.370 
boosts our allies attack for three times
so<00:04:32.010> if<00:04:32.100> he<00:04:32.220> was<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.460> fuse<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.970> into<00:04:33.510> ice<00:04:33.720> then

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
so if he was to fuse this into ice then

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.770 
so if he was to fuse this into ice then
you<00:04:34.650> do<00:04:35.040> potentially<00:04:35.520> have<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> chance<00:04:36.510> to

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
you do potentially have a chance to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.840 
you do potentially have a chance to
level<00:04:37.020> up<00:04:37.230> wisest<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.190> brave<00:04:38.520> person<00:04:39.770> so

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
level up wisest of brave person so

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.790 
level up wisest of brave person so

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
basically to summarize the video guys

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.220 
basically to summarize the video guys
there's<00:04:44.100> three<00:04:44.580> different<00:04:45.300> kinds<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:45.870> brave

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
there's three different kinds of brave

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.470 
there's three different kinds of brave
birds<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.740> have<00:04:46.920> attack<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.820> have<00:04:48.030> support

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
birds you have attack you have support

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.900 
birds you have attack you have support
and<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:49.170> have<00:04:49.380> healing<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.190> in<00:04:50.580> order<00:04:50.820> to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
and you have healing and in order to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.760 
and you have healing and in order to
level<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.570> brave<00:04:51.780> burst<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.440> unit

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
level up the brave burst of the unit

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.830 
level up the brave burst of the unit
that<00:04:52.920> you're<00:04:53.130> trying<00:04:53.520> take<00:04:54.240> notice<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.780> what

type of brave burst the unit passed and

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.500 
type of brave burst the unit passed and
