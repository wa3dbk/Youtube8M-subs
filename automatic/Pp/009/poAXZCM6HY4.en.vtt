okay I understand Leo gets a number yeah

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.439 
okay I understand Leo gets a number yeah
it's<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.639> big<00:04:41.820> decision

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
it's a big decision

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
however um we've been doing this long

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.100 
however um we've been doing this long
enough<00:04:44.699> to<00:04:45.060> know<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.210> when<00:04:45.509> someone<00:04:45.750> wants

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
enough to know that when someone wants

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.080 
enough to know that when someone wants
to<00:04:46.199> sleep<00:04:46.410> on<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.680> almost<00:04:47.190> always<00:04:47.430> there's

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
to sleep on it almost always there's

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.300 
to sleep on it almost always there's
some<00:04:48.720> part<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.199> mathematics<00:04:49.860> if<00:04:50.070> it's<00:04:50.190> the

some part of the mathematics if it's the

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
I could get a little bit more for that

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.260 
I could get a little bit more for that
for<00:05:19.530> my<00:05:19.650> car<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:20.070> was<00:05:20.490> like<00:05:20.520> brand<00:05:20.910> new<00:05:21.000> I
