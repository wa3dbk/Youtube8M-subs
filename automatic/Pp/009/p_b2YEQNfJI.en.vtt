but you got to have some serious

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
but you got to have some serious
soldering<00:01:50.250> skills<00:01:51.020> which<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.229> don't<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.729> had

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
soldering skills which I don't so I had

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.560 
soldering skills which I don't so I had
someone<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:56.030> what<00:01:57.030> I've<00:01:57.149> done<00:01:57.329> here

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

someone do it for me what I've done here
is<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> x8r<00:01:58.530> receiver<00:01:59.070> the<00:02:00.000> receiver

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.770 

antenna<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.500> larger<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.780> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
antenna are a little bit larger here so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.690 
antenna are a little bit larger here so
what<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> had<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.920> drill<00:02:08.220> out<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> hole

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
what I had to do is drill out the hole

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.550 
what I had to do is drill out the hole
down<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> could<00:02:10.050> pass<00:02:10.259> them

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
down here so that I could pass them

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.010 
down here so that I could pass them
through<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.599> turned<00:02:12.840> out

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
through but all in all it turned out

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.630 
through but all in all it turned out

said<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.030> know<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:09.080> about<00:03:09.110> range<00:03:10.100> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
said you know it's all about range and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.360 
said you know it's all about range and
this<00:03:11.300> thing's<00:03:11.600> got<00:03:11.870> some<00:03:11.900> serious<00:03:12.620> range<00:03:12.950> in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
this thing's got some serious range in

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
this thing's got some serious range in
24<00:03:14.030> minutes<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.680> get<00:03:15.860> pretty<00:03:16.760> far<00:03:16.880> you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
24 minutes you can get pretty far you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.910 
24 minutes you can get pretty far you
know<00:03:18.019> when<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> think<00:03:18.829> about<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:20.140> soon<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.590> will

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
know when you think about it soon I will

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.300 
know when you think about it soon I will
be<00:03:22.070> adapting<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:24.280> UHF<00:03:26.620> receiver<00:03:27.620> that's

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
be adapting a UHF receiver that's

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.440 
be adapting a UHF receiver that's
designed<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.150> fit<00:03:29.540> into<00:03:29.959> this<00:03:30.290> thing<00:03:30.590> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
designed to fit into this thing and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.569 
designed to fit into this thing and
basically<00:03:32.450> at<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.530> slides<00:03:33.890> out<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
basically at just this slides out and it

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.110 
basically at just this slides out and it
plugs<00:03:35.329> right<00:03:35.600> in<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.110> could<00:03:36.260> get<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.799> to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
plugs right in and you could get up to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.190 
plugs right in and you could get up to
they<00:03:38.120> say<00:03:38.450> 40<00:03:39.019> kilometer<00:03:39.650> range<00:03:39.920> now<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.329> know

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
they say 40 kilometer range now I know

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.479 
they say 40 kilometer range now I know
what<00:03:42.380> you're<00:03:42.530> thinking<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.010> know<00:03:43.130> who<00:03:43.340> would

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
what you're thinking you know who would

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.370 
what you're thinking you know who would
go<00:03:43.640> for<00:03:43.910> TK<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.269> wouldn't<00:03:44.810> not<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.320> thing

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
go for TK I wouldn't not in this thing

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.830 
go for TK I wouldn't not in this thing
there's<00:03:45.799> not<00:03:45.980> enough<00:03:46.130> power<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:46.840> eventually

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
there's not enough power but eventually

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.650 
there's not enough power but eventually
I<00:03:47.870> will<00:03:48.019> get<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> device<00:03:48.799> some<00:03:49.220> machine<00:03:49.660> flying

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
I will get a device some machine flying

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.250 
I will get a device some machine flying
machine<00:03:51.170> probably<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.570> handle<00:03:54.019> some

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
machine probably that can handle some

machine probably that can handle some
serious<00:03:54.620> distance<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:55.400> know<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:55.910> that's<00:03:56.780> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
serious distance you know so that's the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.900 
serious distance you know so that's the
