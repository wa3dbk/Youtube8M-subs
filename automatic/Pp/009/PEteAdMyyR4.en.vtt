00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and it appears that when I was switching

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
and it appears that when I was switching
pages<00:00:27.180> accidentally<00:00:27.720> did<00:00:27.960> something<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
pages accidentally did something and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
pages accidentally did something and

weird and there's a weird weird glitch
and<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:27.979> springboard<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.670> mean

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
and the springboard of this I mean

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
and the springboard of this I mean
understand<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.749 

and<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.530> yeah<00:01:34.859> there<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.429> we<00:01:35.520> put

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and now yeah there you go then we put

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.919 
and now yeah there you go then we put
that<00:01:35.969> one<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.149> there<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.719> one

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
that one over there that one

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.539 
that one over there that one
automatically<00:01:37.499> locks<00:01:37.770> back<00:01:37.979> into<00:01:38.249> the<00:01:38.340> place

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
automatically locks back into the place

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.910 
automatically locks back into the place
the<00:01:38.789> other<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.149> used<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.569> be<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.520> mean<00:01:41.520> I

the other one used to be I mean I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.109 
the other one used to be I mean I
probably<00:01:43.920> could<00:01:44.130> fix<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.819> I'm<00:01:45.000> just

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
probably could fix it but I'm just

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
probably could fix it but I'm just
letting<00:01:45.810> everybody<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.859> weird

letting everybody know this is a weird

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.859 
letting everybody know this is a weird

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
glitch in it and this is on on right

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.959 
glitch in it and this is on on right
here<00:01:57.679> go<00:01:58.679> do<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.920> real<00:01:59.159> quick<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:01.500> on

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
here go do it real quick it is on

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.289 
here go do it real quick it is on
version<00:02:02.969> 4.3<00:02:03.929> point<00:02:04.409> 1<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.849> not<00:02:06.030> updated

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
version 4.3 point 1 I have not updated

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.930 
version 4.3 point 1 I have not updated
it<00:02:06.750> recently<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.369> probably<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it recently so that's probably the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.900 
it recently so that's probably the
reason<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.519> just<00:02:11.519> thought<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> would<00:02:11.849> be

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
reason but I just thought it would be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.580 
reason but I just thought it would be
cool<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.590> let<00:02:13.590> everybody<00:02:13.860> know<00:02:14.069> about<00:02:14.250> this

I'm<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.769> sure<00:02:16.829> if<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.160> will<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.370> ever<00:02:17.579> happen

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
I'm not sure if it will have ever happen

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.360 
I'm not sure if it will have ever happen
again<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.629> if<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> does<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:20.099> pretty

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
again but if it does and it's pretty

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.979 
again but if it does and it's pretty
cool<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.569> do<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.870> without

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
cool you can do that without
