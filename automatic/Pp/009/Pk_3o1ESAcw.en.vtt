00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 it's up to all those seniors of 45 50 so 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 today to present a video of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.309
 unpacking the gopro ferro 3 white 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.549
 edition so that I do not prefer 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.109
 I preferred the cheapest too 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.670
 So here it stung the time 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.680
 I already have it in pages the jo 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.250
 open I did not wait for this video for 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.900
 open it so bah we'll open it from 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.290
 so then so when we just do not come 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.600
 to buy it via a little sketch here is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.210
 a little pig on both sides camp 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 but after we remove the small scotch 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.870
 either we can remove the plastic the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.140
 does not pixi put that aside 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:01:00.170
 we get to the camera so I do not know 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:03.960
 if you see I made the con the break it 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 yes, so I ordered it I 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 ordered one to the plantiers 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.340
 and then the pack g lease 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.750
 I do not know if you know it's a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.369
 trick with a little pouch with two 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.470
 supports the perpendicular thing 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.650
 we can 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.750
 well it's called the vague skull if 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.950
 you want to go see you type drive 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 by and it'll show you what it is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.450
 what is it and so I ordered 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 recommended lenses to change it 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.330
 because we see when we film 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 the crack so it's not good it's not 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.600
 cool that makes me ch and here is a good excuse 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.550
 me for the terms that I used the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.950
 good word we will continue so when we 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.750
 removed the plastic one can access 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:14.680
 lifting it up fast 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:18.260
 so wait hop 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.520
 then not after but once removed 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.880
 plastic one can remove a cardboard a 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.280
 box that is in already in the box on 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.030
 also put aside 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.480
 and that's after this Mass to appear 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.349
 it 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.500
 with the camera disappointed so I'm going 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.500
 remove 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.700
 that's how there are two little clips to 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.940
 the back must press the backstage is 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.470
 this so simple 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.170
 how's the hand there after this support 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.239
 the bus and we take a cutter that's it 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.769
 I say it's stupid that I got you that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.870
 trash while it can serve as a 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.230
 support we take a cutter we cut 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.360
 the adhesives that is underneath and that's it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.739
 it can come off me I already did 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.599
 because as I tell you moreover 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.950
 did a little bit that I leave so 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.989
 I have already seen a little bit 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:23.280
 that there was actually I see if you 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:26.280
 see there will adhere and here and there in 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.109
 did it just stuck 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.879
 on the box look if the capital we have them 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.579
 cut and that makes a support of more 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.390
 that we can attach davis or if we lose 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.239
 it's doing things 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.090
 I do it with one of the elastics 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.049
 on something on which I'm filming and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.580
 what good always to bear to win 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:57.960
 go know me 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:04:05.010
 after when we open the box then 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:09.870
 little manuals that visit copro 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:13.830
 dot com so that's actually it's for 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.799
 explain that you have to download in pdf 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.350
 of the user manual 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.880
 because yes actually in the box ya 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.300
 no user manuals so crazy 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.590
 and on go own codes and we see the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.110
 User Manual 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.550
 nati sco here after that it's for 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.730
 to say that we need to update 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.070
 attention yes it's to make us a 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.730
 update using go separation 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.510
 pro and you have to go on assistance put 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.500
 product update 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.320
 you even select yourself the model of 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.120
 the camera you have and then it's 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.260
 left you follow the indications 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.270
 and that's it and that's a little paper 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:03.020
 to explain what is guaranteed when 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.419
 you buy it or that 's how it is 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.220
 after in this little box 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:13.979
 our smallest ferry and after there is 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:18.120
 nothing is a bottom the lame no 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.570
 this little box we can find a 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.919
 loader so I'm sb and we 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.100
 reproach the camera not very long but 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:33.530
 that's enough 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.530
 is day 40 cm wide enough 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:42.150
 after we can find the little battery 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.740
 of the camera so everything is unpacked a 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.530
 I unpacked everything I did 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.130
 full of tests be so here's the little 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.130
 drums 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:59.460
 after a hood another cape o 2 for the 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:03.180
 case to put behind there except that 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.120
 him attention there are holes one can 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.410
 pass our fingers so it's not 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.410
 waterproof you have to be careful 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:21.930
 after a support hole 1 which is flat 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.780
 laid on a flat surface and a curved 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.080
 who is curled what to put on the 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.540
 helmets for example 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:36.419
 after this little 8th Lyon it's a 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:39.780
 security in fact that we put here it's 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.270
 from which was born the tech head and that she 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.280
 that we bring to life that to prevent that 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:49.470
 it opens what when it vibrates here 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:53.550
 that's all it's just that and 3 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:07:00.360
 stickers beautiful there already was of 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:03.510
 stick so that's bombay that's all for 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.479
 this video is the next video test 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.000
 of the stabilizer that I made in 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:13.190
 the previous video so the test 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.190
 here we go to pessoulens
