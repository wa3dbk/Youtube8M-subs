00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.910
 just four months very easy very short 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.209
 only the document for you anyway tilt 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.280
 can 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.410
 so we do it if we are clever and rather 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.539
 weak hello hello well i said 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 the second one was just through 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.380
 third is it just to the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.650
 stalls and stone 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 we are in the hiker hills stand 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.020
 right by the hot springs and running 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 Here's a bit of combo 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.480
 along and nothing to bring 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.770
 he was already very fast but 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.570
 I'll get the hole then then 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.890
 exactly by so twice pure 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.090
 you need your blood for a given 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.289
 I want to do that at the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.260
 rich rise 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.670
 that makes me pass and you can only 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.670
 times work 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 every day 15 against this 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.010
 you have to pay attention to these guessing though 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.630
 sitting there then you run against 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.240
 these circles and the city ​​down so 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 you have to wait how high do not fly 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 only nobility have to fly 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.990
 now the dramatic is coming up 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.479
 The fight went to a man army 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.920
 In all, you get 2 armin at the same time 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.170
 will be and it looks very difficult 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.740
 technically so I cut it with me 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.250
 my little and my picture absolutely 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.490
 You can see that is superior and that was 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.800
 thanks that's it but you can 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.450
 still be too heavy 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.820
 That's why we say how to do it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.050
 that with the portal with the portal still 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.270
 that simply marks here 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.880
 a little bit there the portal has completely 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.280
 but next to the box do a bit 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.020
 may walk over rivers already goes up 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.340
 Savers should already be accurate and jump 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.610
 me down in the dark area where the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.769
 Normally people just crash 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.519
 and 7 over there that's the point 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.350
 I jumped first but you see 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.019
 From the sky entrance you can straight line 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.220
 then run here then measure portal 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.600
 here the fund sees exactly what it does 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.600
 good fun
