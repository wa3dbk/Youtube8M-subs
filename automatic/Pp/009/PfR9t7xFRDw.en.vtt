00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.860 
I thought he raised you better than that
you<00:02:43.069> had<00:02:43.250> an<00:02:43.370> awful<00:02:43.880> lot<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.060> say<00:02:44.420> about<00:02:44.450> him

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
you had an awful lot to say about him

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.170 
you had an awful lot to say about him
when<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.140> were<00:02:45.230> unconscious<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.190> from<00:02:47.090> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
when you were unconscious and from the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.750 
when you were unconscious and from the
sound<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.720> he'd<00:02:47.900> be<00:02:48.050> very<00:02:48.410> very<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.340> support

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
sound of it he'd be very very to support

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.120 
sound of it he'd be very very to support
it<00:02:49.850> than<00:02:50.000> what<00:02:50.120> you've<00:02:50.300> become<00:02:50.980> sounds<00:02:51.980> like

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
it than what you've become sounds like

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.940 
it than what you've become sounds like
he<00:02:52.280> didn't<00:02:52.549> spank<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.120> enough<00:02:53.390> as<00:02:53.569> a<00:02:53.600> kid

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
he didn't spank you enough as a kid

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.840 
he didn't spank you enough as a kid
maybe<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.100> can<00:02:55.400> make<00:02:55.610> up<00:02:55.850> for<00:02:56.090> his<00:02:56.180> lost<00:02:56.480> time
