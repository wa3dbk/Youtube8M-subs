systems the first thing you team style

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.560 
systems the first thing you team style
which<00:00:51.280> allows<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.699> player<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.910> fine-tune<00:00:52.420> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.300 

let's<00:01:08.320> see<00:01:08.439> what<00:01:08.560> happens<00:01:08.890> if<00:01:09.009> we<00:01:09.100> mess<00:01:09.280> around

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
let's see what happens if we mess around

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.090 
let's see what happens if we mess around
with<00:01:09.700> Blair<00:01:09.939> support<00:01:10.329> maybe<00:01:11.170> towards<00:01:11.590> 100

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
with Blair support maybe towards 100

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.410 
with Blair support maybe towards 100
which<00:01:12.219> is<00:01:12.250> Max<00:01:12.579> and<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.880> players<00:01:13.090> will<00:01:13.270> move

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
which is Max and the players will move

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.760 
which is Max and the players will move
ahead<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.810> man<00:01:13.990> in<00:01:14.140> possession<00:01:14.289> when

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
ahead of the man in possession when

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.399 
ahead of the man in possession when
waiting<00:01:15.130> for<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.310> ball<00:01:15.600> maybe<00:01:16.600> 20<00:01:17.049> then

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
waiting for the ball maybe 20 then

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
waiting for the ball maybe 20 then
they'll<00:01:17.560> all<00:01:17.710> about<00:01:17.920> drop<00:01:18.220> back<00:01:18.369> behind<00:01:18.520> him

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.720 

you<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> set<00:01:25.800> to<00:01:25.830> 90<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> players

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
you see it set to 90 and players

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.100 
you see it set to 90 and players
overtake<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> man<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.570> possession<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
overtake the man in possession to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.590 
overtake the man in possession to
receive<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.530> ball<00:01:28.680> further<00:01:28.920> upfield

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
receive the ball further upfield

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.670 
receive the ball further upfield
tactical<00:01:30.600> changes<00:01:30.960> take<00:01:31.200> effect<00:01:31.230> immediately

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
tactical changes take effect immediately

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
tactical changes take effect immediately
and<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.820> something<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.240> work<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.450> hard

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and that is something we work very hard

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:43.780 
and that is something we work very hard
on

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.160 

okay<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.970> time<00:01:45.150> let's<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.690> what<00:01:45.810> happens<00:01:46.080> if

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
okay this time let's see what happens if

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
okay this time let's see what happens if
we<00:01:46.320> adjust<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.710> support<00:01:47.040> range<00:01:47.280> push<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> up

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
we adjust the support range push it up

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
we adjust the support range push it up
to<00:01:48.390> 100<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.020> players<00:01:49.350> provide<00:01:49.650> personal

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to 100 and players provide personal

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
to 100 and players provide personal
support<00:01:50.510> good<00:01:51.510> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.690> like<00:01:51.840> playing<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.170> short

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
support good if you like playing a short

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.680 
support good if you like playing a short
passes<00:01:52.860> push<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.700> towards<00:01:53.910> zero<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
passes push it towards zero and the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.170 
passes push it towards zero and the
player<00:01:54.930> spread<00:01:55.290> out<00:02:01.460> this<00:02:02.460> set<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> 10<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
player spread out this set to 10 this

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.090 
player spread out this set to 10 this
time<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:04.110> seems<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.470> perfect<00:02:04.830> length<00:02:05.010> for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
time it seems a perfect length for

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
time it seems a perfect length for
playing<00:02:05.400> long<00:02:05.610> balls<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.300> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.510> see<00:02:06.720> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
playing long balls but you can see it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.719 
playing long balls but you can see it
really<00:02:07.350> isn't<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.830> set<00:02:08.040> up<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.250> play<00:02:08.460> balls

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
really isn't the set up the play balls

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.999 
really isn't the set up the play balls
along<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> ground<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:10.440> always<00:02:10.649> best<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
along the ground it's always best to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:24.290 
along the ground it's always best to
experiment<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.550> find<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.970> own<00:02:12.000> level<00:02:23.300> first

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
experiment to find your own level first

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.970 
experiment to find your own level first
let's<00:02:24.810> take<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.990> look<00:02:25.170> at<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.320> full<00:02:25.560> offensive

let's take a look at the full offensive

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
as support range making short part is

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.830
