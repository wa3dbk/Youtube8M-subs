00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.259
 Peru and Colombia 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.130
 they must accept 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 because he is given a treatment 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.679
 to bolivia ecuador 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.369
 Peru and Colombia are willing to do it 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.509
 a total respect for diversity 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.220
 carmelo it's time to ask for more 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.910
 that allow Peru and Colombia to accelerate the negotiation with the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.900
 European Union 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.070
 that helps us all a lot to fight against poverty 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.920
 two budgets 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.640
 the security of democracy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.330
 and the investment 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.200
 the investment with 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.960
 trust with social responsibility 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.570
 that generates prosperity 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.110
 and the prosperity to manage with social responsibility exceeds purity 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.600
 and built equity 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.930
 I accelerated social policy without investor confidence 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.440
 is to produce 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.330
 emotion this election campaigns and frustrations in government result 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.070
 for us it is fundamental to give confidence to the insertion 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.540
 to give confidence to the investment you have to have faith stability in the rules 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.390
 of game 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.170
 and demand investment social responsibility 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.650
 but not to olimpia frighten her 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.439
 for us security 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.830
 and the investment 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.060
 are measures that help that great end that the construction of social cohesion 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.370
 olagüe subject in which Latin America should think is insane 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.790
 give investors stability in the rules 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.680
 because if investors would not be in the evening if every day to 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.440
 they wake up waiting for a new threat 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.380
 then latin america 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.780
 will have prosperity as long as their basic products are worth 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.110
 but it will not have prosperity derived 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.460
 of a sustained increase in investment in the geographical area, etc 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 aguado arriaga and said that the victory of the law Jorge Ruiz say that the variety 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.210
 of salads for border security 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.340
 in the general strike with the delivery of the greatest of the benefits of countries the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.910
 general incorporation on the boulevard to match with a game based on the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.910
 world economy of colombia in your country 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.979
 have a contract we will show them our city 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.509
 the autopsy to the body of the world 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.949
 the hamdaoui colombia is a country that has had to go hunting for the whale 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.369
 where the children's teachers were analyzed, they set out to remove the walls of the 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.489
 nalón was in the deangeladas stands help the country to buccaneers 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.249
 we Colombians have 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.069
 how is not going to silicon legista incarnation because with the prosecution 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.899
 our 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:42.819
 I would like 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.459
 the legalist aissami parents of deputies in these risk groups 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.109
 proven that not then the government that in an attack on the farc 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:54.579
 caused the assassination of three deputies such as water as well as 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.729
 murderers 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.030
 as for the pair did not want to release the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.619
 three kidnapped 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.209
 that they released her on December 31, claiming military creations from the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.689
 government the government 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.969
 had the version of the boy manuel and the government 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.969
 He asked that not only a DNA test be done 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.979
 by the Colombian scientific community, Manuel Manuel 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.799
 if not also part of the international scientific community and the second 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.809
 census in Spain and that relationship was formed 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.539
 the detective mom of being the author clear red 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:30.439
 and in this case Colombia said 'do not look very simple there is an institution that 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.329
 regulate 182 countries of the world that is interposed center 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.900
 in fact, my farewell 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.310
 if colombia proceeded with transparency or not and what interpol has done is 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.679
 in a report 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.639
 very extensive mateos and splicing has been said bluntly that Colombia has 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.769
 respected the chain of custody and that Colombia has continued with everything again 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.639
 that gives a very high point to work in the category of colombia 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.079
 to our armed forces to our army our mission in iraq 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.100
 2 we respect deeply as crazy or explain 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.309
 the 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.430
 positions of ecuador idulio 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.360
 we do not enter to discuss that matter 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.570
 we respect each other 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.790
 we must learn to work within the Andean community respecting the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.069
 diversity 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.399
 but as we respect the opinions of all day Bolivia 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.550
 and we believe that steven handle the seals with the european union we also say 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.050
 that we allow Colombia and Peru to advance in the negotiation 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.729
 Car 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.629
 so the tlc 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.679
 how not this is if a country does not want it we respect it 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.330
 And if you need another country like the case of Colombia, we ask that this be 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.009
 respect 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:07.800
 why 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.540
 if diversity is to be respected 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.930
 when some country of the can has done I'm going to mercosur there are others that do not 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.250
 we have opposed you have to know how to integrate diversity center within the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.120
 difference of the economies the differences of the territories of the 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.800
 productive offers of the number of inhabitants for example Colombia is a 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.830
 country with 44 million inhabitants 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.129
 you have very unclear colombia has 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.129
 - one-tenth of Bolivia's gas 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.050
 but while Bolivia has eight million inhabitants with 44 

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.469
 millions 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.589
 Colombia do not get very little oil 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.389
 then one also has to look at that diversity 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.439
 seemingly see 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.819
 The reason is that both governments respect what the 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.999
 moral president 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:57.849
 it does not seem very good for him to assert his views, he defines 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.460
 what business chapters and what not 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.030
 in which topics you can dive in which ones you did not ask for postponement 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.139
 flexibility greater asymmetries all that we respect 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.090
 the only thing that we just do not enter to discuss 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.069
 The only thing we ask is that we also respect 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:17.099
 what Colombia, Ecuador and Peru need, that have expressed the need to 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:17.990
 advance in the negotiation
