00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
here guys are just in case yeah this

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.729 
here guys are just in case yeah this
guy's<00:03:10.250> running<00:03:10.489> up<00:03:10.669> the<00:03:10.790> left<00:03:10.969> side<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.480> as<00:03:11.750> you

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
guy's running up the left side so as you

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.270 
guy's running up the left side so as you
can<00:03:12.829> see<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:13.579> just<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:14.060> total<00:03:14.540> fucking

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
can see it's just a total fucking

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.860 
can see it's just a total fucking
annihilation<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.909> I<00:03:17.090> mean<00:03:17.299> these<00:03:17.450> guns<00:03:17.750> are

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
annihilation like I mean these guns are

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.559 
annihilation like I mean these guns are
just<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.230> overpowered<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:19.159> I<00:03:20.090> guess<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.450> is

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
just so overpowered and I guess it is

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.360 
just so overpowered and I guess it is
yeah<00:03:20.599> purely<00:03:21.169> because<00:03:21.409> they're<00:03:22.010> designed<00:03:22.340> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
yeah purely because they're designed to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.710 
yeah purely because they're designed to
take<00:03:22.549> down<00:03:22.729> helicopters<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.389> that<00:03:23.510> sort<00:03:23.690> of

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
take down helicopters and that sort of

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.860 
take down helicopters and that sort of
stuff<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:24.019> well<00:03:24.229> but<00:03:24.379> you<00:03:25.310> know<00:03:25.459> like<00:03:25.750> some<00:03:26.750> of

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
stuff as well but you know like some of

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.659
