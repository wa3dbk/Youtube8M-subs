00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
at a year ago Valerie was 11th at the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
at a year ago Valerie was 11th at the
us's<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:54.030> course<00:00:54.239> she<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> heavyweight<00:00:54.960> at

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
us's of course she was a heavyweight at

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.770 
us's of course she was a heavyweight at
the<00:00:55.320> time<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:56.160> she's<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> middleweight<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.120> we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the time now she's a middleweight and we

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
the time now she's a middleweight and we
asked<00:00:58.050> her<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.559> transition<00:00:59.280> moving

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
asked her about that transition moving

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
asked her about that transition moving
down<00:01:00.800> well<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.489> -<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.449> build<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
down well just for my - my my build I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
down well just for my - my my build I
just<00:01:05.100> felt<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.339> couldn't<00:01:05.549> compete<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just felt I couldn't compete as a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.550 
just felt I couldn't compete as a
heavyweight<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.229> last

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
heavyweight and that's where I was last

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.609 
heavyweight and that's where I was last
year<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.750> died<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.080> hard<00:01:10.260> came<00:01:10.530> in

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
year so I died it really hard came in

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
year so I died it really hard came in
his<00:01:10.740> mill<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> year<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:11.640> sure<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
his mill this year and I'm sure I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.690 
his mill this year and I'm sure I
improvement<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> percent<00:01:13.700> like

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
improvement is a kind of percent like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
improvement is a kind of percent like
keeping<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> symmetry<00:01:15.840> where<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.409> should<00:01:16.590> be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
keeping the symmetry where it should be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
keeping the symmetry where it should be
and<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:18.540> getting<00:01:18.930> diet<00:01:19.200> down<00:01:20.960> Shawn<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:22.110> do

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and just getting diet down Shawn what do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.600 
and just getting diet down Shawn what do
you<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:22.860> idea<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.400> from

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you think was it a good idea to go from

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.219 
you think was it a good idea to go from
heavy<00:01:23.790> weights<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.330> middle<00:01:24.540> weights<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:25.110> her

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
heavy weights to middle weights for her

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
heavy weights to middle weights for her
paid<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.130> uh<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.759> wasn't<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
paid off it was uh it wasn't really a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.999 
paid off it was uh it wasn't really a
gamble<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.810> five<00:01:28.020> six<00:01:28.290> she's<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> top<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
gamble at five six she's at the top of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.289 
gamble at five six she's at the top of
the<00:01:29.070> middleweight<00:01:29.369> class<00:01:29.610> rather<00:01:29.880> than<00:01:30.150> being

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the middleweight class rather than being

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.609 
the middleweight class rather than being
at<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> bottom<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> heavyweight<00:01:31.409> class

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
at the bottom of the heavyweight class

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.999 
at the bottom of the heavyweight class
again<00:01:32.549> her<00:01:33.030> symmetry<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> her<00:01:34.290> ace<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
again her symmetry is her ace in the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.960 
again her symmetry is her ace in the
hole

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
hole

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
hole
not<00:01:36.270> only<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.869> she's<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.229> great

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
not only that but she's got great

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.710 
not only that but she's got great

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
other words the moment of truth it

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.930 
other words the moment of truth it
doesn't<00:03:46.560> come<00:03:46.739> down<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:47.010> who's<00:03:47.160> hungrier

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
doesn't come down to who's hungrier

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.400 
doesn't come down to who's hungrier
but<00:03:48.150> basically<00:03:48.329> who's<00:03:48.720> got<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.049> best<00:03:49.200> package

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
but basically who's got the best package

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.160 
but basically who's got the best package
in<00:03:50.040> my<00:03:50.280> opinion<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:50.940> Valerie<00:03:51.540> Gangi<00:03:51.989> she's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
in my opinion I like Valerie Gangi she's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.380 
in my opinion I like Valerie Gangi she's
much<00:03:52.380> more<00:03:52.590> symmetrical<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.459> an<00:03:53.940> equal

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
much more symmetrical in an equal

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.789 
much more symmetrical in an equal
condition<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.410> Chris<00:03:55.590> Vaughn

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
condition to that of Chris Vaughn

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.330 
condition to that of Chris Vaughn
Giovanni

Giovanni

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.830 
Giovanni
but<00:03:56.640> again<00:03:56.850> Chris<00:03:57.180> being<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.510> little<00:03:57.750> bit

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
but again Chris being a little bit

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.110 
but again Chris being a little bit
bigger<00:03:58.110> but<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.890> little<00:03:59.160> shorter<00:03:59.549> carries<00:04:00.090> a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
bigger but a little shorter carries a

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
bigger but a little shorter carries a
little<00:04:00.239> more<00:04:00.480> muscle<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.079> depends<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.530> what

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
little more muscle so it depends on what

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.949 
little more muscle so it depends on what
the<00:04:01.739> judges<00:04:01.890> want<00:04:02.190> shape<00:04:02.549> symmetry<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.540> little

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
the judges want shape symmetry a little

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.960 
the judges want shape symmetry a little
bit<00:04:04.079> more<00:04:04.230> mass<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:05.280> lightweight<00:04:05.640> Angie

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
bit more mass the lightweight Angie

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.819 
bit more mass the lightweight Angie
