00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
quite a bit different they change the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.100 
quite a bit different they change the
battle<00:00:35.760> system<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.510> basically<00:00:36.899> an

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
battle system so it's basically an

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.220 
battle system so it's basically an
action<00:00:37.500> battle<00:00:37.770> system<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.879> rest<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
action battle system the rest of it it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
action battle system the rest of it it
looks<00:00:40.379> pretty<00:00:40.469> stupid<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.670> story<00:00:41.940> looks

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
looks pretty stupid the story looks

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
looks pretty stupid the story looks
pretty<00:00:42.629> stupid<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> point<00:00:44.160> now

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
pretty stupid I think at this point now

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.990 
pretty stupid I think at this point now
three<00:00:45.390> games<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:46.280> there<00:00:47.280> they're<00:00:47.700> under<00:00:47.969> a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
instead of it being turn-based you run

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.680 
instead of it being turn-based you run
in<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.370> can<00:02:51.580> switch<00:02:51.910> forms<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.569> like

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
in and you can switch forms just like

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.440 
in and you can switch forms just like
the<00:02:52.810> other<00:02:53.040> 13<00:02:54.040> games<00:02:54.310> right<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.330> are

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
whatever there's a block button you

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.160 
whatever there's a block button you
gauge<00:03:06.070> depletes<00:03:06.820> every<00:03:07.090> time<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.360> attack<00:03:07.660> but

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
gauge depletes every time you attack but

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.110 
gauge depletes every time you attack but
then<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.470> switch<00:03:08.709> forms<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.400> then<00:03:09.549> that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
then you switch forms and then that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.580 
then you switch forms and then that
other<00:03:10.269> form<00:03:10.570> has<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> full<00:03:10.959> gauge<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:11.440> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
other form has a full gauge and you can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.440 
other form has a full gauge and you can
attack<00:03:11.829> 20<00:03:12.100> times<00:03:12.280> if<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.489> want<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:13.120> long<00:03:13.180> as

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
attack 20 times if you want as long as

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.860 
attack 20 times if you want as long as
you<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.780> some<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.090> gauge<00:03:16.299> full<00:03:16.570> on<00:03:16.690> any

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
you have some of the gauge full on any

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.319 
you have some of the gauge full on any
of<00:03:16.989> those<00:03:17.079> forms<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.250> can<00:03:18.400> attack<00:03:18.640> if

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
of those forms then you can attack if

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.810 
of those forms then you can attack if
not<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.720> better<00:03:19.750> block<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.320> watch<00:03:20.440> out<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
not you better block and watch out the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.220 
not you better block and watch out the
things<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.120> return<00:03:22.420> are<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.959> stagger

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
things that return are the stagger

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.590 
things that return are the stagger
system<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.489> still<00:03:24.760> stagger<00:03:25.150> enemies

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
system so you can still stagger enemies

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.150 
system so you can still stagger enemies
but<00:03:26.230> now<00:03:26.440> there's<00:03:26.709> something<00:03:26.829> called<00:03:27.010> an

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
but now there's something called an

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160 
but now there's something called an
overdrive<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.359> say<00:03:28.540> like<00:03:28.720> someone<00:03:28.989> had<00:03:29.140> a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
overdrive so say like someone had a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.080 
overdrive so say like someone had a
weakness<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.620> lightning<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.130> can<00:03:30.310> just<00:03:30.519> spam

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
weakness to lightning you can just spam

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.340 
weakness to lightning you can just spam
them<00:03:31.269> with<00:03:31.390> lightning<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:31.930> they<00:03:32.049> won't

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
them with lightning but they won't

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.009 
them with lightning but they won't
stagger<00:03:32.859> you<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.299> overdrive<00:03:34.840> which

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
stagger you have to overdrive which

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.039 
stagger you have to overdrive which
means<00:03:35.260> basically<00:03:35.880> crack<00:03:36.880> out<00:03:37.090> everything

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
means basically crack out everything

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.630 
means basically crack out everything
goes<00:03:38.200> double<00:03:38.530> speed<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.070> then<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.430> just

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
goes double speed and then you just

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.660 
goes double speed and then you just
throw<00:03:39.700> attacks<00:03:40.299> as<00:03:40.450> fast<00:03:40.660> as<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.900> can<00:03:41.640> not<00:03:42.640> a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
throw attacks as fast as you can not a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.420 
throw attacks as fast as you can not a
