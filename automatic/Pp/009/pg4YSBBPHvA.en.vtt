00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.600 

so<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> oldest<00:02:17.170> part<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.400> team

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so this is the oldest part of the team

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.890 
so this is the oldest part of the team
it's<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.540> team<00:02:19.690> truck<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:21.520> build<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.030> on

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the junior last time it was built in

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.290 
the junior last time it was built in
2005<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.470> still<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> same<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:27.970> have

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
2005 and it's still the same so we have

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.190

the the stock for for a car we made just

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
the the stock for for a car we made just
small<00:02:33.040> changes<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> big<00:02:33.760> guitar<00:02:33.880> but

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
small changes for the big guitar but

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.590
