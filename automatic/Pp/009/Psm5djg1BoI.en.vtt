00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it all appears incredibly difficult to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.539 
it all appears incredibly difficult to
me<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> watch<00:01:49.710> commentators<00:01:50.310> trying<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
me when I watch commentators trying to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.130 
me when I watch commentators trying to
erasure<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.360> surprised<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.049> most

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
erasure what what surprised you the most

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.800 
erasure what what surprised you the most
about<00:01:52.470> about<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> experience<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.570> suppose

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
about about the experience and I suppose

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
about about the experience and I suppose
the<00:01:55.140> pressure<00:01:55.460> more<00:01:56.460> than<00:01:56.610> anything<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.210> know

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the pressure more than anything you know

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
the pressure more than anything you know
I've<00:01:57.869> been<00:01:58.110> calling<00:01:58.350> great<00:01:58.619> hands<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
I've been calling great hands for the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.789 
I've been calling great hands for the
last<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.549> few<00:01:59.850> months<00:02:00.000> home<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.899> then<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
last a few months home but then then you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.310 
last a few months home but then then you
put<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.430> many<00:02:02.520> different<00:02:02.939> colors<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
put like so many different colors and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.480 
put like so many different colors and
names<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.560> guess<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> greyhounds<00:02:05.369> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
names I guess with the greyhounds it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
names I guess with the greyhounds it's
just<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> numbers<00:02:06.030> yeah<00:02:06.240> well<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> know

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just the numbers yeah well you just know

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.419 
just the numbers yeah well you just know
what<00:02:07.409> they're<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.710> gonna<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.099> wearing<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
what they're all gonna be wearing the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.669 
what they're all gonna be wearing the
same<00:02:08.459> colors<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
same colors so

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.589 
same colors so
you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.069> exactly<00:02:10.280> where<00:02:11.269> they<00:02:11.360> gonna<00:02:11.450> be

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
you know exactly where they gonna be

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.449 
you know exactly where they gonna be
coming<00:02:11.840> from<00:02:12.019> but<00:02:12.170> but<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:12.799> obviously<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
coming from but but then obviously the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.940 
coming from but but then obviously the
pressure<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.420> think<00:02:15.019> just<00:02:15.230> making<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
pressure of I think just making the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.220 
pressure of I think just making the
wrong<00:02:16.069> call<00:02:16.329> that<00:02:17.329> was<00:02:17.450> one<00:02:17.629> thing<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.870> I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
wrong call that was one thing that I

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
wrong call that was one thing that I
found<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:19.250> stood<00:02:19.459> out<00:02:19.610> more<00:02:20.060> than<00:02:20.120> anything

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.229 
play-by-play yeah there's never been a
bar<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.069> think<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.549> if<00:03:10.790> any<00:03:10.970> girl

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
bar and I think you know if any girl

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.140 
bar and I think you know if any girl
wanted<00:03:11.659> to<00:03:11.750> put<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> demo<00:03:12.230> tape<00:03:12.609> forward<00:03:13.609> I<00:03:13.819> mean

wanted to put a demo tape forward I mean
you<00:03:15.049> know<00:03:15.169> I<00:03:15.199> think<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:16.340> would<00:03:16.489> be<00:03:16.639> judged

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
you know I think it would be judged

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.729 
you know I think it would be judged
purely<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.599> merit<00:03:17.629> I<00:03:18.139> mean<00:03:18.290> I've<00:03:18.379> been<00:03:18.410> saying

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
purely on merit I mean I've been saying

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.020 
purely on merit I mean I've been saying
for<00:03:18.889> years<00:03:18.919> there's<00:03:19.310> no<00:03:19.430> reason<00:03:19.790> why<00:03:19.910> there

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
for years there's no reason why there

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.119 
for years there's no reason why there
shouldn't<00:03:20.540> be<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.750> female<00:03:21.019> racing<00:03:21.739> commentator

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
shouldn't be a female racing commentator

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.430 
shouldn't be a female racing commentator
and<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:22.879> think<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.599> know<00:03:23.690> Rachel<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.169> Hayley

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
and I think you know Rachel and Hayley

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.710 
and I think you know Rachel and Hayley
to<00:03:24.949> come<00:03:25.159> through<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:25.699> and<00:03:25.909> with<00:03:26.269> so<00:03:26.510> little

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
to come through this and with so little

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.830 
to come through this and with so little
experience<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:28.250> produce<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.389> to<00:03:29.599> very

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
experience to produce that on to very

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.659 
experience to produce that on to very
difficult<00:03:30.230> courses<00:03:30.530> was<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.799> was<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> really

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
difficult courses was a was a really

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.490 
difficult courses was a was a really
excellent<00:03:31.970> effort<00:03:32.419> I<00:03:32.510> mean<00:03:32.659> Hayley<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.199> struck

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
excellent effort I mean Hayley it struck

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.589 
excellent effort I mean Hayley it struck
me<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.760> watching<00:03:34.760> these<00:03:34.849> guys<00:03:35.090> work<00:03:35.359> over

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
me that watching these guys work over

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.390 
me that watching these guys work over
the<00:03:35.750> last<00:03:35.840> few<00:03:36.079> years<00:03:36.319> you<00:03:36.470> rarely<00:03:36.709> get<00:03:37.010> praise

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
the last few years you rarely get praise

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.099 
the last few years you rarely get praise
for<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:38.090> good<00:03:38.299> commentary<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.049> to

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
for a good commentary and you have to

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.569 
for a good commentary and you have to
have<00:03:39.199> a<00:03:39.260> pretty<00:03:39.409> thick<00:03:39.530> skin<00:03:39.979> when<00:03:40.010> when

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
have a pretty thick skin when when

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.309 
have a pretty thick skin when when
things<00:03:40.819> don't<00:03:41.000> go<00:03:41.150> right<00:03:41.479> and<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.079> guess

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
things don't go right and and I guess

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.110 
things don't go right and and I guess
perhaps<00:03:42.650> that's<00:03:43.010> why<00:03:43.129> some<00:03:43.459> girls<00:03:43.849> are<00:03:44.000> being

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
perhaps that's why some girls are being

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.659 
perhaps that's why some girls are being
deterred<00:03:44.449> yeah<00:03:45.139> absolutely<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.919> think<00:03:46.099> that

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
deterred yeah absolutely I think that

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.240 
deterred yeah absolutely I think that
they're<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.989> one<00:03:48.199> people<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.829> sport<00:03:49.099> that

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
they're the one people in the sport that

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.520 
they're the one people in the sport that
probably<00:03:49.489> don't<00:03:49.879> get<00:03:50.090> any<00:03:50.299> credit<00:03:50.599> for<00:03:50.840> what

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
probably don't get any credit for what

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.710 
probably don't get any credit for what
they<00:03:51.739> do<00:03:51.879> but<00:03:52.879> yet<00:03:53.030> when<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.209> goes<00:03:53.449> wrong

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
they do but yet when it goes wrong

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.839 
they do but yet when it goes wrong
they're<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.229> first<00:03:54.470> people<00:03:54.949> to<00:03:54.979> get<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.729> they

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
they're the first people to get in they

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.330 
they're the first people to get in they
slapped<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.449> it<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:56.900> that's<00:03:57.889> why<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.069> just

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
slapped on it and that's why I just

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.390 
slapped on it and that's why I just
think<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.359> quite<00:03:59.690> scary<00:04:00.019> about<00:04:00.739> getting<00:04:01.280> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
think it is quite scary about getting it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.649 
think it is quite scary about getting it
wrong<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.609> thing<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:04.849> you're<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.389> it

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
wrong it is the thing that you're in it

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.360 
wrong it is the thing that you're in it
is<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.989> thing<00:04:06.169> that<00:04:06.199> you<00:04:06.470> fear<00:04:06.799> isn't<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.280> I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
is the thing that you fear isn't it I

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.000 
is the thing that you fear isn't it I
know<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.579> that<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.000> we<00:04:08.540> are<00:04:08.900> only<00:04:09.290> human<00:04:09.650> and
