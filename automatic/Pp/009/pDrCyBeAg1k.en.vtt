00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.650
 kolja and it is on the way again today 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.660
 in the service of science 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.630
 we will place us access today 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.650
 to the best post workout sheikh 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.039
 out 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.439
 We'll take a look at insulin levels 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.470
 how high it rises and become today 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.150
 Two checks and we have then 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.030
 Find out which check is the best 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.410
 that is always such a thing that was 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.070
 blood comes in then automatically 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 Naturally 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.080
 so we have a location change 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.330
 started even with me in the kitchen 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.520
 I'll take a look what I am 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.840
 keep everything so have in my small 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 brain again at first the terrain 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.360
 screw that up 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.140
 scorer off 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.010
 why are they actually doing this 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.010
 waterproof 3 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.180
 control try and be the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.620
 simplifying evaluation watch as behaves 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.060
 actually my darling in mine 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.540
 body, for example, when I am liquid 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.620
 take up 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.300
 by testing the shakes 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.760
 it could well be that there is located 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.310
 massively behave differently or you even know 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.380
 not like that or if my body is 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.520
 obmann insulin level already increased 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 if I somehow drink water and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.860
 that's why we're testing that with the help of the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.320
 water what happens there if there what 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.780
 happens and that is then just in the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.210
 Evaluation is incorporated incorporated 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.310
 just to calculate the whole and to 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.000
 Look if the boss of the section so much 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.830
 raised 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.140
 my water has already raised so 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.240
 because you have to look if the whole in 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.070
 practice, remuneration to incorporate 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.420
 I have my old days as a chemist 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:33.680
 yet this centrifuge had over to the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.720
 to divide blood from the serum and then because 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.520
 we need blood serum insulin 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.840
 to be able to select 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:49.510
 and this device is the device of the device 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.310
 never sleeps and it is this note 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.290
 notes so fast that this is 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.160
 deposits serum from the blood corpuscles and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.390
 then you have just shared that whole 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.670
 you have to pay attention here once 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.819
 that the whole thing naturally balanced 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.849
 is because of you 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.769
 one after all, against that the whole 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.749
 balanced then you put that 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.219
 whole thing depending on how much gram 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.980
 you have in there and how many 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.540
 turns then depending on how 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.549
 many minutes that he has in it and 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.549
 we do first the first test 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:42.980
 last year 2012 84 kg 85 12 percent 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.880
 body fat overweight then three 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.420
 months later I was at 8.9 percent 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.459
 body fat organs so in there have a lot of kilos 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:00.680
 removed 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:06.080
 July 2012 ten percent body fat 14 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.610
 percent 14 body fat 87 kilo effect 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.910
 when he became a father 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.350
 the most blatant thing that shocked me so much 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 why me at ten percent 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.210
 i have here on july 17 th July 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.220
 I have the most blatant for six weeks 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.560
 training program and nutrition program 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.040
 pulled even know the person 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.040
 absolute mail program absolutely okay 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.190
 only for all wheels to my training 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:49.470
 or nutrition doubt 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:05:00.270
 six weeks later at total 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:05:02.640
 body fat 62 percent so 81 kilos 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.200
 then 62 percent had body fat so 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.080
 more weight as a place is where you 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.950
 Twelve, what if I'm not 12:30 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.770
 40 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:17.210
 what should I do now 80 guests did 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.870
 at 886 was and still difficult 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.550
 That's your goal again 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.310
 probably that's my goal again 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:32.570
 there comes back and here that 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.570
 was now in january 89 killer 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:41.790
 18:31 with the urine has become 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:48.120
 Deposed from the age it has left 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:49.650
 in between is what is needed around the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.280
 insulin worth and the sugar and so on 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.280
 continue to 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.690
 we need the serum and the team we do 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.340
 then 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.780
 in a laboratory to 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.780
 So we only need the yellow stuff 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.220
 So blood is also yellow 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.160
 maybe all the dyes from the 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:20.780
 fantasy the grandma can drink must here 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.780
 so go to take part up 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.500
 that 's frozen that's the gold that 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.500
 one simply labels first 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.500
 Yes 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.730
 little brought with hamburgers so far 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.580
 OK 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.310
 muckel
