chocolate<00:01:17.210> lava<00:01:17.510> cakes<00:01:17.870> because<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.560> middle

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
chocolate lava cakes because the middle

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.040 
chocolate lava cakes because the middle
of<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.160> inside<00:01:19.730> is<00:01:20.090> going<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.360> be<00:01:20.420> running<00:01:20.720> so

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
of the inside is going to be running so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.050 
of the inside is going to be running so
when<00:01:21.200> people<00:01:21.380> cut<00:01:21.740> into<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.030> to

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
when people cut into it it's going to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.730 
when people cut into it it's going to
have<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.240> lovely<00:01:23.450> gooey<00:01:23.840> chocolate<00:01:24.320> sauce<00:01:24.530> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.960 

so<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> mixtures<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:33.900> combined<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.909> making<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so the mixtures now combined I making a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.230 
so the mixtures now combined I making a
few<00:01:36.210> extra<00:01:36.390> things<00:01:36.630> over<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.970> I've<00:01:38.970> got<00:01:39.000> my

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
few extra things over here I've got my

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
few extra things over here I've got my

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
trusty spatula and here I've got a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.480 
trusty spatula and here I've got a
couple<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.520> Anakin's<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.390> I've<00:01:43.380> cut<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.250> some

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
couple of Anakin's and I've cut out some

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
couple of Anakin's and I've cut out some
greaseproof<00:01:44.729> paper<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.630> circle<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
greaseproof paper and little circle and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
greaseproof paper and little circle and
it's<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> turn<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:47.820> upside

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's because I want to turn them upside

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.180 
it's because I want to turn them upside
down<00:01:48.360> onto<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> plate<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> end<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
down onto a plate at the end and this

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.920 
down onto a plate at the end and this
will<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.490> help<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.970> without<00:01:51.149> those<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
will just help it without those if you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
will just help it without those if you
turn<00:01:52.140> upside<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.890> probably<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.340> get

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
turn upside down it probably will get

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.130 
turn upside down it probably will get
stuck<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:56.220> start<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.780> we've<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
stuck so to start with we've just get a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.609 
stuck so to start with we've just get a
bit<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> mixture<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:01.050> put<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.440> on<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
bit of the mixture and put it on the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.950 
bit of the mixture and put it on the
bottom<00:02:02.039> and<00:02:02.330> I'm<00:02:03.330> just<00:02:03.539> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.720> take<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
bottom and I'm just going to take a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
bottom and I'm just going to take a
queue<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> chocolate<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> put<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.729> top

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
queue of chocolate and put it on top

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.100 
queue of chocolate and put it on top
like<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:08.630> put<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.720> rest<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.019> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
like that and then put the rest of the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
like that and then put the rest of the
mixture<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.590> top<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.519> don't<00:02:11.550> feel<00:02:12.060> them

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
mixture on top you don't feel them

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.000 
mixture on top you don't feel them
actually<00:02:12.360> too<00:02:12.780> much<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.380> they<00:02:13.680> really

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
actually too much because they really

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.170 
actually too much because they really
rise<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> oven<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.120> be

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
rise in the oven and so it was not to be

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.870 
rise in the oven and so it was not to be
careful<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.890> then<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> cover

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
careful and then I'm just going to cover

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.610 
careful and then I'm just going to cover

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
then put it in a microwave for about 50

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.360 
then put it in a microwave for about 50
seconds<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.410> don't<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.800> overdo<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.190> so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
if you do too much then actually there

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.650 
if you do too much then actually there
won't<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> gooey<00:02:29.010> chocolate<00:02:29.550> Center<00:02:30.030> so
