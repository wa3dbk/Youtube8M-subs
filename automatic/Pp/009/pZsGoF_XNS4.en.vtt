terrible
so<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> moment<00:01:40.890> yeah<00:01:41.250> i'm<00:01:41.399> switching

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
so here in a moment yeah i'm switching

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420 
so here in a moment yeah i'm switching
it<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.299> he<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:43.049> show<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.430> here's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
it so like he can show you here's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.660 
it so like he can show you here's
separate<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.470> center<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.979> how<00:01:47.369> many<00:01:47.520> games

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
separate like center of how many games

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.219 
separate like center of how many games
you<00:01:47.790> played<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> sentiment<00:01:48.750> how<00:01:48.899> many<00:01:49.020> but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you played as a sentiment how many but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
you played as a sentiment how many but
like<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.920> played<00:01:50.100> two<00:01:50.310> games<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:51.000> wing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
like I played two games as a right wing

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
like I played two games as a right wing
and<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.840> trilogies<00:01:55.140> separately<00:01:55.740> for

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and so it's trilogies separately for

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.590 
and so it's trilogies separately for
that<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.580> cool<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.060> shows<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that so that's really cool to shows you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.730 
that so that's really cool to shows you
a<00:01:58.080> lot<00:01:58.590> easier<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:59.039> guess<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:00.439> it<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.619> just

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
a lot easier I guess and it was just
