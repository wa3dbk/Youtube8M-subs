layer<00:03:01.160> alright<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.460> talked<00:03:02.700> about<00:03:02.850> how

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
layer alright so we talked about how

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.640 
layer alright so we talked about how
deep<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.540> make<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.050> but<00:03:04.170> people<00:03:04.410> are<00:03:04.500> always

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
deep to make it but people are always

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.440 
deep to make it but people are always

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
asking me how far after the Trump do you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570 
asking me how far after the Trump do you
extend<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> moles<00:03:07.140> question<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.430> always

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
extend the moles question and I always

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.920 
extend the moles question and I always
kind<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.910> joke<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> trees<00:03:09.750> could

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
kind of joke that if the trees could

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.180 
kind of joke that if the trees could
talk<00:03:10.110> they'd<00:03:10.380> want<00:03:10.530> their<00:03:10.590> entire<00:03:10.920> root

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
talk they'd want their entire root

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.190 
talk they'd want their entire root
system<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.550> be<00:03:11.700> option<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.420> guess<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:13.020> good

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
system to be option I guess it's good

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.760 
system to be option I guess it's good
the<00:03:13.350> trees<00:03:13.620> can't<00:03:13.890> talk<00:03:14.100> good<00:03:14.550> fight
