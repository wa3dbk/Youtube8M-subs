00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.440
 good my name is madder is so 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.620
 today I will teach you to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 to mount whites in firm snow 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.049
 so first of all we have to separate the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.049
 yellow white of course 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.460
 so you have to be careful not to 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.230
 break the yellows in the whites which 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.439
 would prevent the whites from rising well into 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.439
 snow 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 Yes 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 m 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.860
 so always see the snow flowers a 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.860
 small shell tip for taste 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:33.280
 then if we do not have a robot we can 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:41.350
 take a small electric mixer 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.350
 light so we start quite slowly 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.240
 and as you go 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.240
 we have the mind etc 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:21.240
 so here we see that they are my 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:25.130
 business even tia our fees that's all 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.130
 simply whites in snow
