all sorts of interesting stuff I've
never<00:03:47.930> really<00:03:48.200> messed<00:03:48.350> around<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.680> dev<00:03:48.830> kit

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
never really messed around the dev kit

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.920 
never really messed around the dev kit
but<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.250> figured<00:03:49.640> since<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> triple<00:03:50.780> man

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
but I figured since it's a triple man

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.240 
but I figured since it's a triple man
might<00:03:51.170> as<00:03:51.260> well<00:03:51.380> make<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.560> all<00:03:51.770> tricked<00:03:52.130> out

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
might as well make it all tricked out

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.050 
might as well make it all tricked out
