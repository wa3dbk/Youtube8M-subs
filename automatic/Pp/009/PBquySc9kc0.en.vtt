 as there are a lot of big youtuber 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.729
 to begin 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.609
 it's going to be kind of a complement to the 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.010

 in every episode there is pretty much 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.469

 game yesterday then the game modes of 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.600
 war I can advise you that xp 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.390
 quite quickly in terms of the ratio of 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.760
 time spent and xp win I can you 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.140
 advise it be 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.930
 so what is it is it is 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.310
 a little mode you finally that if you 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.360
 have had the opportunity to see in my 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 halo episodes 4 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.870
 there the latest in date his possessions 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.080
 I also invite you to the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.720
 see 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.519
 it's a little mode one shoot one that he 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 so we have to shoot in the head and that's 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.950
 from one shot what will you kill in one go 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 and lower it will bring you that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.269
 will train you to shoot well aim 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 the head and where so the parts get 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.420
 drop down 600 points if I remember 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.489
 well and every kill that you do this 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.290
 earn 10 points to your team so 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.209
 that's what I'm telling you here at the level of 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.750
 time spent high level of the game that 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.940
 can be very fast and of course that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.250
 does not hurt about 3 million 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.130
 on average we will say 3000 xp points 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.139
 per game if you win the game well 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.290
 sure because it gives 600 or 700 points 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.079
 if I remembered the victory so 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.269
 here is a pretty cool mode after a 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.980
 other mode I have little opportunity to test 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.260
 a lot besides sniper but it's not 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.790
 top 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.720

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.390
 advise it is really the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.390
 fashion at the time spent ratio 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.670
