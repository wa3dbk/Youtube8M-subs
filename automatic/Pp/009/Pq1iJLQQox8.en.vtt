people who drive jeepers angles wave to

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.960 
people who drive jeepers angles wave to
each<00:00:01.680> other<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.070> wanted<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.370> find<00:00:02.610> out<00:00:02.790> why

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
each other and I wanted to find out why

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.030 
each other and I wanted to find out why
so<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.689> did<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> little<00:00:04.080> bit<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.319> research<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:04.920> I

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
so I did a little bit of research and I

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.680 
so I did a little bit of research and I
figured<00:00:05.310> I'd<00:00:05.400> share<00:00:05.580> my<00:00:05.759> results<00:00:05.879> with<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.330> so

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690

here is the jeep wave explain now my
first<00:00:11.610> thought<00:00:11.880> was<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.240> originated<00:00:12.719> with

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
first thought was that originated with

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.570 
first thought was that originated with
World<00:00:13.110> War<00:00:13.290> two<00:00:13.469> vets<00:00:13.740> coming<00:00:14.009> back<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.429> wave

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
with each other but that has nothing to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
with each other but that has nothing to
do<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.230> all<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.920> jeep<00:00:17.160> wave<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.580> simply

officially saying it's worth 14 and the
course<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:13.860> research<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.369> found<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> there

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
course of my research I found that there

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
course of my research I found that there
might<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.360> groups<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.750> people<00:01:15.930> who<00:01:16.200> maybe

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
might be two groups of people who maybe

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.859 
might be two groups of people who maybe
weakening<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> tradition<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> wave

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
weakening the tradition of the wave

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.179 
weakening the tradition of the wave
group<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.140> people<00:01:19.560> who<00:01:19.619> bought<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> Jeep
