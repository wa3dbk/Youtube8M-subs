to your dragon frame software and
basically<00:00:37.280> what<00:00:37.460> you're<00:00:37.550> doing<00:00:37.610> is<00:00:37.850> putting

basically what you're doing is putting
the<00:00:38.180> camera<00:00:38.449> on<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.900> slider<00:00:39.170> or<00:00:39.500> camera<00:00:39.860> on

the camera on the slider or camera on
the<00:00:40.129> Omni<00:00:40.400> head<00:00:40.550> that's<00:00:40.640> connected<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the Omni head that's connected to the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.600 
the Omni head that's connected to the
slider<00:00:41.449> and<00:00:41.769> you're<00:00:42.769> programming<00:00:43.400> within

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
slider and you're programming within

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.009 
slider and you're programming within
dragon<00:00:44.330> frame<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.890> can<00:00:46.190> frame<00:00:47.019> the

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
dragon frame that is I can frame the

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.750 
dragon frame that is I can frame the
motion<00:00:48.379> that<00:00:48.409> you<00:00:48.589> want<00:00:48.860> as<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.280> take<00:00:49.460> frames

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
motion that you want as you take frames

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.630 
motion that you want as you take frames
in<00:00:50.210> your<00:00:50.299> animation<00:00:50.979> pretty<00:00:51.979> much<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
in your animation pretty much the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.509 
in your animation pretty much the
coolest<00:00:52.820> toy<00:00:53.449> on<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.839> block<00:00:54.049> right<00:00:54.290> now<00:00:54.519> and

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
coolest toy on the block right now and

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.180 
coolest toy on the block right now and
it's<00:00:56.059> cost-effective<00:00:56.479> this<00:00:57.350> piece<00:00:57.620> here<00:00:57.979> the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
it's cost-effective this piece here the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.310 
it's cost-effective this piece here the
Omni<00:00:58.460> slider<00:00:58.760> happens<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.690> run<00:00:59.930> I<00:00:59.960> believe<00:01:00.110> in

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
Omni slider happens to run I believe in

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.950 
Omni slider happens to run I believe in
a<00:01:00.350> thousand<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:01.010> fifteen<00:01:01.909> hundred<00:01:01.940> dollars<00:01:02.239> us

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars us

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.820 
a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars us
and<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:05.119> omni<00:01:05.540> head<00:01:05.930> last<00:01:06.409> time<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.590> checked

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
and the omni head last time I checked

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.170 
and the omni head last time I checked
was<00:01:06.979> about<00:01:07.130> two<00:01:07.340> thousand<00:01:07.729> five<00:01:07.820> hundred

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
was about two thousand five hundred

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.560 
was about two thousand five hundred
dollars<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.880> know<00:01:11.000> roughly<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:13.850> seems<00:01:14.299> a

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
dollars you know roughly so that seems a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.020 
dollars you know roughly so that seems a
little<00:01:14.689> steep<00:01:15.080> right<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.760> got<00:01:16.909> to<00:01:17.000> think

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
little steep right but you got to think

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.660 
little steep right but you got to think
about<00:01:17.299> this<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:18.620> ability<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.190> control

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
about this the ability just to control

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.850 
about this the ability just to control
your<00:01:20.090> camera<00:01:20.360> moving<00:01:20.900> forward<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.350> back<00:01:21.590> we

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
your camera moving forward and back we

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.310 
your camera moving forward and back we
didn't<00:01:22.100> side<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.970> side<00:01:23.210> panning<00:01:24.170> tilting

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
didn't side to side panning tilting

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.250 
didn't side to side panning tilting
dollying<00:01:24.920> all<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.160> stuff<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:26.780> alone<00:01:27.110> just

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
dollying all that stuff that alone just

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.060 
dollying all that stuff that alone just
this<00:01:27.500> slider<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:29.440> incredible<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:30.620> mean<00:01:30.860> just

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
this slider is incredible I mean just

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.650 
this slider is incredible I mean just
the<00:01:31.160> cost<00:01:31.430> wise<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> thousand<00:01:32.180> dollars<00:01:32.420> oh<00:01:32.540> my

pretty worried that your animators gonna
get<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.670> know<00:01:43.760> worn<00:01:44.060> out<00:01:44.240> from<00:01:44.570> cranking<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
get you know worn out from cranking the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.580 
get you know worn out from cranking the
slider<00:01:46.700> or<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:47.150> can't<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:48.080> know<00:01:48.140> make<00:01:48.560> a

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
slider or you just can't you know make a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.320 
slider or you just can't you know make a
slider<00:01:48.920> fast<00:01:49.220> enough<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.210> the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
slider fast enough this is this is the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.420 
slider fast enough this is this is the
way<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.480> go<00:01:50.720> now<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.530> kind<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.860> tilt<00:01:52.130> head<00:01:52.280> it'd

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
way to go now the kind of tilt head it'd

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.450 
way to go now the kind of tilt head it'd
be<00:01:52.520> pretty<00:01:53.030> freaking<00:01:53.720> awesome<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.460> cost-wise

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
be pretty freaking awesome but cost-wise

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.850 
be pretty freaking awesome but cost-wise
definitely<00:01:56.360> on<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> high<00:01:56.720> end<00:01:56.750> if<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.710> would

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
definitely on the high end if I would

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.860 
definitely on the high end if I would
suggest<00:01:58.010> this<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.580> small<00:01:59.360> studio<00:01:59.690> to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
suggest this for like a small studio to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.320 
suggest this for like a small studio to
a<00:01:59.960> large<00:02:00.229> studio<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:01.159> mean<00:02:01.550> I<00:02:01.580> really<00:02:02.090> think

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
a large studio I mean I really think

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.500 
a large studio I mean I really think
Studios<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:02.990> Leica<00:02:03.350> or<00:02:03.800> ornament<00:02:04.760> or<00:02:05.030> any<00:02:05.330> of

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
Studios like Leica or ornament or any of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.910 
Studios like Leica or ornament or any of
those<00:02:05.600> studios<00:02:05.870> probably<00:02:06.409> be<00:02:06.470> using<00:02:06.830> these

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
those studios probably be using these

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.830 
those studios probably be using these
suckers<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.490> do<00:02:07.640> know<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.300> fact<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.569> some

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
suckers I do know for a fact that some
