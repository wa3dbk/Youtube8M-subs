00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.610 
and then I'll switch them out again and
see<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.420> mean<00:02:10.599> I'll<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.810> make<00:02:11.260> sure<00:02:11.439> that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
see I mean I'll just make sure that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.140 
see I mean I'll just make sure that
whichever<00:02:11.890> one<00:02:12.129> whichever<00:02:12.400> babies<00:02:12.879> leave<00:02:13.060> her

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
whichever one whichever babies leave her

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.940 
whichever one whichever babies leave her
the<00:02:13.269> most<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.659> time<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:14.769> her

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the most at the time will be with her

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.710 
the most at the time will be with her
but<00:02:15.129> she<00:02:15.310> only<00:02:15.459> has<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.849> demand<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.360> three

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.559 
but she only has the demand of three
babies<00:02:16.989> at<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> time<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:18.340> think<00:02:18.549> that<00:02:18.849> will<00:02:19.180> help

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569

babies at a time I think that will help
that<00:02:22.569> way<00:02:23.970> because<00:02:24.970> I'm<00:02:25.150> not<00:02:25.239> ready<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> just

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
that's what you get sometimes so I

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.560 
that's what you get sometimes so I
didn't<00:04:29.230> anticipate<00:04:29.590> that<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.400> now<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.300> we

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
didn't anticipate that but now that we

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.850 
didn't anticipate that but now that we
have<00:04:31.600> that<00:04:31.930> I'm<00:04:32.080> just<00:04:32.320> going<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.500> do<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.770> best

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
have that I'm just going to do the best

have that I'm just going to do the best
I<00:04:33.040> can<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.540> so<00:04:34.930> what<00:04:35.410> I'll<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:36.010> I'll<00:04:36.250> just

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
I can and so what I'll do is I'll just

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.610 
I can and so what I'll do is I'll just
keep<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:37.090> really<00:04:37.570> close<00:04:37.690> eye<00:04:37.990> on<00:04:38.020> these<00:04:38.290> babies

them<00:04:54.040> some<00:04:54.250> hay<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.060> they<00:04:55.270> can

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
them some hay in here so that they can

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.430 
them some hay in here so that they can
have<00:04:55.600> access<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:56.200> hay<00:04:56.350> all<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.610> time<00:04:57.790> and

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
have access to hay all the time and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.780 
have access to hay all the time and
anyway<00:04:59.440> that's<00:04:59.650> that's<00:05:00.010> what<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.310> figure<00:05:00.640> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
anyway that's that's what I figure the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
anyway that's that's what I figure the
best<00:05:00.820> solution<00:05:01.450> in<00:05:02.080> this<00:05:02.440> situation<00:05:03.010> is<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:04.570> I

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
best solution in this situation is so I

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.830 
best solution in this situation is so I
just<00:05:05.440> thought<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.680> would<00:05:05.860> share<00:05:06.310> that

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
just thought I would share that

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.150 
just thought I would share that
information<00:05:07.840> in<00:05:07.960> case<00:05:08.110> anybody<00:05:08.440> else<00:05:08.620> has<00:05:08.860> a

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
information in case anybody else has a

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.150 
information in case anybody else has a
situation<00:05:09.870> like<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.760> already<00:05:12.760> back
