00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.480 
expensive than your average one you know
this<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.140> probably<00:02:04.410> about<00:02:04.650> movie<00:02:05.040> free<00:02:05.280> books

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
this is probably about movie free books

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
this is probably about movie free books
as<00:02:05.670> opposed<00:02:05.910> this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> probably<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.690> 10

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
as opposed this is probably about 10

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.070 
as opposed this is probably about 10
bucks<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:09.180> combo<00:02:09.479> ones<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:09.900> great

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
bucks so the combo ones are really great

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.720 
bucks so the combo ones are really great
because<00:02:10.320> it<00:02:10.410> has<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> nose<00:02:10.800> plier<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.640> you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
because it has a nose plier where you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.700 
because it has a nose plier where you
can<00:02:11.850> actually<00:02:12.000> make<00:02:12.300> ground<00:02:12.690> loops<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
can actually make ground loops and it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.530 
can actually make ground loops and it
also<00:02:13.860> has<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.100> little<00:02:14.340> wire<00:02:14.520> cutter<00:02:14.940> right<00:02:15.180> here

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
also has a little wire cutter right here

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.290 
also has a little wire cutter right here
we<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.960> cut<00:02:16.110> your<00:02:16.230> line<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.340> I'm<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.270> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
we can cut your line so I'm going to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.500 
we can cut your line so I'm going to
start<00:02:18.390> off<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:18.780> about<00:02:19.560> let's<00:02:20.460> say<00:02:20.580> about<00:02:21.120> 12

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
start off with about let's say about 12

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.210 
start off with about let's say about 12
inches<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.960> wire<00:02:22.170> you're<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.770> keep

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
inches of wire you're going to keep

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.400 
inches of wire you're going to keep
coming<00:02:23.430> back<00:02:23.580> from<00:02:23.880> normal<00:02:24.300> wire<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.320> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
coming back from normal wire so if you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.830 
coming back from normal wire so if you
want<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> start<00:02:25.800> off<00:02:25.890> longer<00:02:26.430> maybe<00:02:27.030> 24<00:02:27.570> inches

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
want to start off longer maybe 24 inches

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
want to start off longer maybe 24 inches
that's<00:02:28.050> fine<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.400> get<00:02:29.580> more

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that's fine because you just get more

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.810 
that's fine because you just get more
wrapping<00:02:30.240> ability<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.710> we're<00:02:31.860> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.040> sort

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
wrapping ability so we're going to sort

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.180 
wrapping ability so we're going to sort
of<00:02:32.940> cut<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> wire<00:02:39.380> angles<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.100> you're

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
of cut the wire angles and what you're

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.960 
of cut the wire angles and what you're
going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> do<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.580> you're<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.880> take

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
going to do is you're going to take

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.170 
going to do is you're going to take
maybe<00:02:42.480> about<00:02:42.600> an<00:02:43.080> inch<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.280> wire<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.150> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
maybe about an inch of the wire and so I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
maybe about an inch of the wire and so I
don't<00:02:45.330> just<00:02:45.480> wrap<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:46.140> couple<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.500> times<00:02:46.560> to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
don't just wrap it a couple of times to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.220 
don't just wrap it a couple of times to
sort<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.130> secure<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.760> around<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.570> bangle<00:02:49.020> I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
sort of secure it around the bangle I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.140 
sort of secure it around the bangle I
was<00:02:49.920> suggesting<00:02:50.070> maybe<00:02:50.460> wrapping<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.970> maybe

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
was suggesting maybe wrapping it maybe

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.630 
was suggesting maybe wrapping it maybe
five<00:02:51.450> or<00:02:51.480> six<00:02:51.810> times<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.710> sort<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.130> get<00:02:53.340> a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
five or six times just to sort of get a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.730 
five or six times just to sort of get a
good<00:02:54.300> starting<00:02:54.720> point<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.710> see

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
good starting point and as you can see

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.990 
good starting point and as you can see
once<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.100> wrap<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.700> take<00:02:56.910> your

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
once you wrap it you just take your

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390 
once you wrap it you just take your
fingers<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.320> sort<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> slide<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
fingers and you just sort of slide it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.220 
fingers and you just sort of slide it
together<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:00.990> like<00:03:01.170> a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
together like that so you can get like a

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.199 
together like that so you can get like a
nice<00:03:02.120> loop<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:04.820> then<00:03:05.820> we're<00:03:06.060> going<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
nice loop like that then we're going to

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.030 
nice loop like that then we're going to
use<00:03:06.480> i'm<00:03:06.780> using<00:03:07.050> seed<00:03:07.320> beads<00:03:07.620> which<00:03:07.920> I

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
use i'm using seed beads which I

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770 
use i'm using seed beads which I
typically<00:03:08.400> want<00:03:08.580> me<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.790> work<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.480> for

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
typically want me to work with but for

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.780 
typically want me to work with but for
these<00:03:09.900> purposes<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.770> really<00:03:11.010> good<00:03:11.190> they

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
these purposes it's really good they

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.340 
these purposes it's really good they
just<00:03:11.820> get<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.270> over<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.630> place<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.170> some

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
just get all over the place and some

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.750 
just get all over the place and some
idealities<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.310> they're<00:03:14.430> actually<00:03:14.550> really

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
idealities but they're actually really

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.910 
idealities but they're actually really
straight<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.870> I'm<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.709> start

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
straight to you so I'm going to start

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.380 
straight to you so I'm going to start
off<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:17.489> CD<00:03:17.940> sort<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.900> stringing<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:20.390> on

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
off with one CD sort of stringing it on

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.990 
off with one CD sort of stringing it on
the<00:03:21.690> line

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.170 

all<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.480> way<00:03:26.569> down<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.409> let<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.819> sit<00:03:28.819> on<00:03:29.000> top

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
all the way down and let it sit on top

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.459 
all the way down and let it sit on top
of<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.390> bangle<00:03:29.689> with<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> round<00:03:30.049> bangles

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
of the bangle with the round bangles

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.809 
of the bangle with the round bangles
it's<00:03:30.560> kind<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.799> hard<00:03:31.010> because<00:03:31.099> it's<00:03:31.430> around

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
it's kind of hard because it's around

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.000 
it's kind of hard because it's around
services<00:03:32.450> local<00:03:32.840> squares<00:03:33.230> where<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.829> actually

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
services local squares where it actually

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.619 
services local squares where it actually
has<00:03:34.280> like<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.430> flat<00:03:34.730> surface<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.209> can<00:03:35.329> sit<00:03:35.599> on

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
has like a flat surface you can sit on

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.240 
has like a flat surface you can sit on
but<00:03:36.200> nonetheless<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:36.650> can<00:03:36.799> do<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.129> either

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
but nonetheless you can do it on either

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.479 
but nonetheless you can do it on either
one<00:03:37.519> you're<00:03:38.329> going<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.510> take<00:03:38.689> the<00:03:38.900> wire<00:03:39.489> and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
one you're going to take the wire and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.330 
one you're going to take the wire and
you're<00:03:40.640> going<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.819> wrap<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:45.010> three<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.129> four

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
you're going to wrap it three to four

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.030 
you're going to wrap it three to four
times<00:03:47.170> don't<00:03:48.170> wrap<00:03:48.349> it<00:03:48.500> any<00:03:48.620> more<00:03:48.829> than<00:03:49.010> that

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
times don't wrap it any more than that

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.220 
times don't wrap it any more than that
because<00:03:49.159> then<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.970> beads<00:03:50.269> as<00:03:50.659> you<00:03:50.870> start<00:03:51.139> to

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
because then the beads as you start to

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.360 
because then the beads as you start to
string<00:03:51.439> on<00:03:51.560> more<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:51.769> more<00:03:51.859> beads<00:03:52.129> are<00:03:52.250> going

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
string on more and more beads are going

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.399 
string on more and more beads are going
to<00:03:52.459> be<00:03:52.519> further<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:52.939> further<00:03:53.060> apart<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:54.019> I

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
to be further and further apart so I

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.050 
to be further and further apart so I
wouldn't<00:03:55.040> wrap<00:03:55.159> it<00:03:55.310> any<00:03:55.430> more<00:03:55.609> than<00:03:55.760> three<00:03:55.970> to

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
wouldn't wrap it any more than three to

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.300 
wouldn't wrap it any more than three to
four<00:03:56.269> times<00:03:56.299> or<00:03:56.959> if<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.319> beads<00:03:57.950> are<00:03:58.069> going<00:03:58.250> to
