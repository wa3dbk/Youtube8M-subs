00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.520
 Good way to get back to another 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.690
 gta4 makes an appearance 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.250
 probably why we are 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.290
 actually not at the airport but 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 Send yourself 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.500
 Ford Crown Victoria in a black 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 white in web edi paint 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 or lcp radio 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.570
 yes that has quite a reason today 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 we return to a slightly different fashion the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.779
 vehicle still a fleet but one 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.240
 style fashion today for the 51 50 is the next 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.670
 According to company I have already blatant 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:39.920
 like today my sound and original ones 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:39.920
 npd originals the sirens and at all 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.250
 blue light martinshorn police operation 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.320
 motorist force a sound 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.719
 it can be a theme of museums 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.510
 instead of the normal dull honk and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.949
 then when we come third it is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.359
 Incidentally, original recordings of the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.979
 mpg vehicles so it has now 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.210
 maybe not a little now and then 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.119
 oversteer in it was not the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.740
 100% quality but for that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.010
 is just in the original or visor one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010
 normal 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.200
 then we would have pushed 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.470
 ohu 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.470
 Why 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.940
 OK 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.940
 curious 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.740
 ola 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.130
 definitely cool and modern 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 so a little the atmosphere 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.220
 I definitely want to improve and mine 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 something completely different is already pretty 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.630
 I think that's pretty different 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630
 hot 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.009
 and yes, I like it everyone 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 Of course, everyone has to do it for themselves 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.590
 what marco does not decide for itself and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.640
 yes in any case I like it if it is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.709
 permanent and let play but you 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 I do not know well, yes I'm down 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.540
 is as always our organic farms 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.610
 a shorter sequence but I thought so 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.950
 that's a lot of two cars 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.140
 Still looking for a good one very good 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.739
 police car motto be goal of 10 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.739
 could give 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.819
 is a description is to look 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.930
 to the source Reuters 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.930
 until next time
