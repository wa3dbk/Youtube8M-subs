00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello dear friends i like to blog 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.870
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.420
 two weeks ago I have an article 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.800
 I started the series on the subject of track construction 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.240
 already have flex circles from 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.750
 presented to different manufacturers 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.519
 and the track is like ascot 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.739
 using is glassvegas from max ott can 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.589
 you flex circuits weigh wonderful and on 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.480
 but the right radius will bring flex 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.099
 not only do circles look good on them 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 Can also contribute to the safe 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.750
 provide power in the garden 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.850
 in issue number 14 of the sports magazine 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.220
 norbert roÃŸ has described that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 cross section of a lgb track approximately 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.840
 at 28 square millimeters lies 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.670
 if you compare the brass track with 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.200
 a copper pipe corresponds to that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.610
 about a copper pipe with the 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.270
 diameter of seven square millimeters 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.400
 compare that to the normal one 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.130
 Feeder in the garden is probably the best 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.840
 significantly higher 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.940
 If you put long flex tracks of 1 for a long time 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.449
 meter 50 or even three meters long 1 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.920
 you can benefit from it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.780
 important for it is only a good equal 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.020
 at binder the power transmission 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.369
 ensures a track bumps and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.319
 I'll show you that today 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.590
 Rail connection by Hubert Madeleine 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:20.789
 We look best from Liechtenstein 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.789
 us only to model on it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.619
 the rail connection of hubert matt 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:30.159
 Lena consist of two brass strips 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.049
 and you can screw four screws on the model 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:38.259
 good to see that each two screws 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:39.579
 connected with a rail are the 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.380
 Both measure pieces become like that 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.200
 bolted that the rails safely 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.729
 be compressed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.920
 in the middle is a small gap 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.679
 This allows the tracks in the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.539
 summer and in winter expand and 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.950
 can pull together without the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.079
 Track systems will be damaged if you 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 If you look very closely you can see that the 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.560
 inner brass strip angled upwards 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.039
 is at everyone seemed to have profile on 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.179
 Two holes are drilled at the end 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.340
 this works best with the drilling 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.720
 stencil of hubert matt lena she is 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.260
 specially hardened 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.880
 so you can easily drill it 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.290
 the rail profiles can be 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.290
 smoothly insert laterally 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.800
 as you can see it is before the final 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.800
 tighten still play available 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.720
 For isolated descent offers oberkleener 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.540
 special rail connection 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.070
 Plastic we see is that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.440
 basic principle but the same as in 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.270
 the best variant before drilling 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 First, the pure teaching in the safe 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.440
 vise to be attached 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.500
 then the profile can polish 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.840
 be inserted 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.830
 this is also available for pre-assembled ones 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:50.520
 the track will be up to the stop 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.520
 carried out 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.140
 I hope you have a good one now 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.990
 impression of the rails connecting from 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.280
 word madeleine received 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.040
 Of course, the montage is on like it 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.420
 not higher than other solutions 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.000
 but World Matt Lena and his customers 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.680
 swear on this rail connection 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.510
 according to her information, the 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.790
 Rail connection for a safe and secure 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.580
 permanent power supply also after 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.260
 years without maintenance, that is 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.140
 certainly an escape must be worthwhile 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.880
 to take a closer look 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.470
 I hope today's edition again 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.710
 We'll be back soon 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.710
 on www.tchibo.de until then
