main thing to remember is that when

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.289 
main thing to remember is that when
we're<00:00:14.250> talking<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.759> all<00:00:14.880> these<00:00:15.030> pieces

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
we're talking about all these pieces

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.150 
we're talking about all these pieces
that<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:15.780> all<00:00:16.049> relate<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> same<00:00:16.859> thing

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
that they all relate to the same thing

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.769 
that they all relate to the same thing
which<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.609> evolution<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> web<00:00:18.510> and
