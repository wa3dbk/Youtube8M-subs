00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.200
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.439
 test the tesoro catfish sabers 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.579
 pro with concentric spyder discs from 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.340
 21 by 24 cm the settings used 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.770
 maximum sensitivity mode 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 discrimination discrimination to 0 that's 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.420
 enough to discriminate the little ones 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.059
 Ferrous presentation of the test tray on 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.280
 pvc tubes in the center of the test tray is 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 removable 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.620
 I can take it out of the bin completely 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.660
 It measures 42 cm in height 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 whenever I want to put a 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 currency at a precise height I go out 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.870
 so the tube of the test bin I use 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.510
 wooden wedges so for example for 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.350
 put a change to 20 cm in the tube 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 I will use 22 cm of wooden wedges 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 once the wooden shims are 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 installed 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.530
 I put the change and then I fill 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.579
 the earth tube the currencies used 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 are on the left 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.310
 1 ap orleans troyes 10 cents to the right 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.530
 a small bronze coin of 15 mm 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.770
 diameter both currencies are taped 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 on cartons of the inner diameter of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.259
 pvc tube to be sure that every time 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.170
 they are in the center of the tube the napoleon 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.170
 is 10.9 cm deep in the tube 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.880
 here is the Napoleon is perfectly 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.340
 detect we'll put it to 20 cm on 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 Napoleon is now 20 cm from 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.630
 depth in the tube 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.840
 we saw in discrimination it is not 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.950
 more obviously detected if I did not feel 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:23.260
 metals having all metals it is detected 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.850
 necessarily since it is really beyond 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.820
 of the depth limit but in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 discrimination 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.810
 it is no longer detected so for the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.600
 Napoleon 10 cents we will remember 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.210
 the depth of 19 cm I have now 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.550
 place the small change of 15 mm 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.550
 diameter at 11 cm depth 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.420
 as you can see she is 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.860
 perfectly detected I have now 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.290
 place the small change of 15 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.290
 millimeters to 12 cm deep 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.320
 as you can see she 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.560
 is not detected so we're going 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.500
 retain 11 cm for the small change of 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.230
 15 mm will now make the test of 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.810
 selectivity the currency of 15 mm from 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.570
 diameter is 8 cm deep including 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:38.250
 the ferrous tube is 3 cm 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:40.140
 distance from the tube as you can see 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.150
 the currency is not detected we 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.970
 let's now put the fair e to 4 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.650
 cm away from the ferrous tube and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:54.180
 now four centimeters from 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:56.130
 distance from the tube as you can 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.860
 note the currency is correctly 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.959
 detected at a passage in two so we 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.850
 let's take four centimeters of 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.920
 distance for the selectivity test 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.310
 go to next week for a 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.310
 new test
