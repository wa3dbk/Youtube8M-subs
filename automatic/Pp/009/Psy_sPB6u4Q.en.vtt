at mac OS extended and then hit security
options<00:01:53.189> before<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.579> hit<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> race<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.600> what

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
options before you hit a race so what

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
options before you hit a race so what
you<00:01:54.869> want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.259> choose<00:01:55.439> either<00:01:55.560> 0<00:01:56.100> at

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you want to do is choose either 0 at

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
data or seven pass erase you see when

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.830 
data or seven pass erase you see when
you<00:01:58.500> simply<00:01:58.860> erase<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.430> disk<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.299> data<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.750> all

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you simply erase a disk the data is all

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
you simply erase a disk the data is all
still<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> links<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> data

still there but the links to the data

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.569 
still there but the links to the data
the<00:02:03.390> links<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.780> form<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.380> bits<00:02:04.799> into<00:02:05.070> files

the links that form the bits into files

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.510 
the links that form the bits into files
are<00:02:05.909> erased<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.320> somebody<00:02:07.799> theoretically

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
are erased so somebody theoretically

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
are erased so somebody theoretically
still<00:02:08.849> go<00:02:08.970> through<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> drive<00:02:09.599> find<00:02:10.050> credit

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
still go through the drive find credit

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.199 
still go through the drive find credit
card<00:02:10.590> numbers<00:02:10.860> passwords<00:02:11.039> things<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.030> that

card numbers passwords things like that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.550 
card numbers passwords things like that
so<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.450> want<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> make<00:02:12.690> sure<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.170> Drive

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so you want to make sure this Drive

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.309 
so you want to make sure this Drive
is<00:02:13.620> cleaned<00:02:13.980> off<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.640> its<00:02:14.819> new<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.900> zero<00:02:16.170> out

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
is cleaned off like its new so zero out

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.740 
is cleaned off like its new so zero out
data<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.860> fine<00:02:17.250> security<00:02:17.940> experts<00:02:18.030> will<00:02:18.480> want

data is fine security experts will want

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.420

seven times just to be extra sure that
the<00:02:23.910> bits<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.690> are<00:02:24.870> zeroed<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.849> now<00:02:26.849> once

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the bits really are zeroed out now once

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.630 
the bits really are zeroed out now once
you've<00:02:27.270> done<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:28.890> then<00:02:29.250> hit<00:02:29.489> the
