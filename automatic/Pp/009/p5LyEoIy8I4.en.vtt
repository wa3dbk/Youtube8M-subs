00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
in comparison to each other and in my

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
in comparison to each other and in my
opinion<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> coin<00:00:37.440> flip<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.949> you<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
opinion it's a coin flip if you want a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.759 
opinion it's a coin flip if you want a
better<00:00:38.670> blocking<00:00:39.019> tight<00:00:40.019> end<00:00:40.260> go<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.530> Mackey

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
better blocking tight end go with Mackey
