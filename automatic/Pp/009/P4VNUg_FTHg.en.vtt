a<00:00:13.450> token<00:00:14.450> point<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.750> view<00:00:14.840> for<00:00:14.990> me<00:00:15.080> it's<00:00:15.200> about

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
a token point of view for me it's about

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.499 
a token point of view for me it's about
getting<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.740> best<00:00:15.950> performance<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.359> that

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509 
getting the best performance so that

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.689 
getting the best performance so that
means<00:00:17.720> how<00:00:18.199> they<00:00:18.560> perform<00:00:19.039> in<00:00:19.159> the<00:00:19.249> race<00:00:19.369> so

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
means how they perform in the race so

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
just gonna go from the gun and I think

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:39.219 
just gonna go from the gun and I think
yeah<00:01:37.549> we<00:01:37.579> could<00:01:37.969> it<00:01:38.539> could<00:01:38.689> be<00:01:38.810> one<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.109> those

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
yeah we could it could be one of those

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.870 
yeah we could it could be one of those
sort<00:01:39.469> of<00:01:39.499> bogey<00:01:39.889> stages<00:01:40.340> where<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.549> could

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
sort of bogey stages where you could

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.149 
sort of bogey stages where you could
lose<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.479> lot<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:41.990> time<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.560> yeah<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:42.950> it's<00:01:43.100> just

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
lose a lot of time so yeah so it's just
