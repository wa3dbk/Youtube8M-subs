00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
when I was growing up we call that move

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.030 
when I was growing up we call that move
a<00:03:10.510> gesture<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.140> may<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.409> a<00:03:11.439> different<00:03:11.890> name

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.870 
the other way and I'm doing in a jumping
motion<00:04:45.080> okay<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.680> start<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:47.370> think<00:04:47.820> a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
motion okay so I like to start I think a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.950 
motion okay so I like to start I think a
stall<00:04:48.180> would<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.419> easier<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.810> start<00:04:50.840> flick<00:04:51.840> the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
stall would be easier to start flick the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.070 
stall would be easier to start flick the
ball<00:04:52.080> up<00:04:52.229> put<00:04:52.800> your<00:04:52.919> other<00:04:53.010> foot<00:04:53.280> around<00:04:53.430> it

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
ball up put your other foot around it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.810 
ball up put your other foot around it
kick<00:04:55.080> but<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.470> can<00:04:55.620> also<00:04:55.889> try<00:04:56.160> more<00:04:57.060> difficult

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
kick but you can also try more difficult

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:13.050 
kick but you can also try more difficult
with<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.850> juggle<00:05:00.300> in<00:05:00.510> between<00:05:02.419> juggle<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.539> start

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.820 

if<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.690> want<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.960> get<00:05:14.050> more<00:05:14.320> of<00:05:14.440> these<00:05:14.530> tricks

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
if you want to get more of these tricks

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:32.890 
if you want to get more of these tricks
always<00:05:15.400> practice<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.390> both<00:05:16.600> feet
