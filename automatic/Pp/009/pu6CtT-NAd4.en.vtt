00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
this is an ASA 15-inch laptop and this

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.670 
this is an ASA 15-inch laptop and this
is<00:00:13.480> the<00:00:13.690> packard<00:00:14.200> bell<00:00:14.230> easynote<00:00:14.789> excess<00:00:15.789> 20

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
is the packard bell easynote excess 20

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.509 
is the packard bell easynote excess 20
this<00:00:17.680> is<00:00:17.980> a<00:00:18.010> 7-inch<00:00:18.850> fully<00:00:19.840> functional<00:00:21.029> laptop

this is a 7-inch fully functional laptop

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.040 
this is a 7-inch fully functional laptop
so<00:00:24.519> again<00:00:24.699> it's<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.910> easing<00:00:25.119> out<00:00:25.179> excess<00:00:25.539> 20

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
un pc it's got a 7-inch screen so let's

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.240 
un pc it's got a 7-inch screen so let's
go<00:01:22.509> quickly<00:01:22.810> around<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.110> device<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.799> talk

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
go quickly around the device and talk

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.460 
go quickly around the device and talk
through<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> ports<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.299> we'll<00:01:26.049> open<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:26.320> up

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
through the ports and we'll open it up

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.200 
through the ports and we'll open it up
and<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.799> look<00:01:27.009> at<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.340> keyboard<00:01:27.729> screen

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
and have a look at the keyboard screen

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.749 
and have a look at the keyboard screen
after<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.689> so<00:01:29.439> here<00:01:29.590> we've<00:01:29.680> got<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.950> DVI<00:01:30.400> port

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
after that so here we've got a DVI port

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.580 
after that so here we've got a DVI port
which<00:01:30.909> you<00:01:31.060> don't<00:01:31.240> often<00:01:31.540> see<00:01:31.689> you<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.079> devices

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
come with an adapter for analog but you

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.760 
come with an adapter for analog but you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.030 
could be upgraded to fail input port
there<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.270> let's<00:02:18.540> open<00:02:18.720> up<00:02:19.110> open<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.650> the

there so let's open up open it up the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.720 
there so let's open up open it up the
first<00:02:20.280> thing<00:02:20.430> you'll<00:02:20.550> see<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:20.850> it's<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.510> fairly

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
first thing you'll see is it's a fairly

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.970 
first thing you'll see is it's a fairly
unusual<00:02:23.730> design<00:02:24.510> where<00:02:25.380> there's<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> hole

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
unusual design where there's a hole

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.780 
unusual design where there's a hole
underneath<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.590> screen<00:02:28.590> here<00:02:28.860> as<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.760> can

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
underneath the screen here as you can

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.490 
underneath the screen here as you can
see<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.630> put<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:30.780> hand<00:02:31.110> through<00:02:31.230> there

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
see I can put my hand through there

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.380 
see I can put my hand through there
quite<00:02:31.980> easily<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.430> makes<00:02:32.640> quite<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> nice<00:02:33.150> way

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
quite easily it makes quite a nice way

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.680 
quite easily it makes quite a nice way
to<00:02:33.420> hold<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> device<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.490> actually

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
to hold the device so you can actually

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.600 
to hold the device so you can actually
type<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.900> handed<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.410> hold<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:38.130> handed<00:02:38.490> as

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
type one handed and hold one handed as

here<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:35.190> reason<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.670> those<00:03:35.790> being<00:03:36.060> up<00:03:36.180> there

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
here the reason for those being up there

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.000 
here the reason for those being up there
is<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.110> actually<00:03:37.230> use<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.739> in

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
is so that you can actually use it in

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.070 
is so that you can actually use it in
this<00:03:38.760> mode

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
this mode

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.860 
this mode
that<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.380> can<00:03:40.560> actually<00:03:41.630> use<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.780> without

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
that you can actually use it without

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.510 
that you can actually use it without
butt<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.710> a<00:03:43.740> table<00:03:43.950> hold<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.200> use<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.520> so

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
butt out it on a table hold it use it so

isn't too bad in terms of quality I've

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.170 
isn't too bad in terms of quality I've
tried<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.330> one<00:04:21.510> out<00:04:22.580> there's<00:04:23.580> also<00:04:23.700> stereo

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
tried that one out there's also stereo

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.110

similar<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:39.390> hinges<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:39.870> actually<00:04:40.500> quite

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
similar the hinges are actually quite

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.810 
similar the hinges are actually quite
good<00:04:41.150> they<00:04:42.150> seem<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.660> be<00:04:42.750> fairly<00:04:43.020> fairly

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
good they seem to be fairly fairly

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.970 
good they seem to be fairly fairly
sturdy<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.090> strong<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.710> think<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:49.770> could

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
sturdy and strong so I think it could

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.640 
sturdy and strong so I think it could
stand<00:04:50.280> up<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.700> rigors<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.650> certainly
