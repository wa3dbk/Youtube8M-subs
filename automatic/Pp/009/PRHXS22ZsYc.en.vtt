00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.920
 hi girls like with this obviously 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.719
 new video today 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.010
 also this time I present a trick 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 always for these holidays 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.050
 this one in particular will be for new year's eve 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.669
 surely then I decided to index 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.529
 do this trick which I think a lot 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:27.779
 bright approaching I'll show you well 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.849
 it's pretty simple actually I've used 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.680
 three pigments of the brand that I make you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:39.180
 see at this moment 1 m.llo then ho 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.000
 also used pink bronze and then I used 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.219
 this coop is also called ruby che 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 as you can see they are very beautiful very very much 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.640
 bright 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.289
 logically that if you don't have and you have 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 these products you can use whatever 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.940
 another object that resembles these them 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.589
 you can also find it on an oval of 180 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.079
 colors or one of the hundred old 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.489
 that is easy to find 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.710
 as colors then used two other palettes 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.840
 which are of the grain of an edition 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.760
 limited that I can't remember now how 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760
 it's still called the usual generous 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.770
 fair and then also this one called pc 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.230
 she of whom I took simply 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.190
 a color this sort of of 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.590
 red brown or brick color then like 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.630
 see on the lips I put a lipstick 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 which in my opinion very very nice than not 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 I can find 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 ok and this is the max 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.040
 last collection of triana and this is it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 this particular color is called 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.820
 but really barbieri and is a gnu project 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.220
 that on me is very natural 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.340
 because it is very similar to color 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.010
 natural of my lips and nothing 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.470
 this is a very nice trick for me 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.260
 I hope you like it as you already have 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.490
 understood this the last video for this 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.750
 year 2013 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.250
 then see you in 2014 and no girl 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 I hope you like this trick e 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.650
 if you want to know how to do it I leave you 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.869
 there we begin then 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.640
 quickly first of all I apply the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.890
 base for mini eye shadows in my case 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.560
 you will always see it celebrated by essence 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.999
 because as you know I like it very much 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.069
 now I'm going to get the 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.100
 generous and of the grain and I take this 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.500
 brown color 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.450
 not very clear but completely 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
 I apply over the whole fixed eyelid but 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.220
 as you can see I use a very large brush 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 and he went as far as the thief of a mountain 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.220
 time I did this I go to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 take another seat always wanting to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.300
 grain and I take this brick color 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.100
 completely mark always use the same 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.100
 brush and as you can see I apply it 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.540
 just above the brown but 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.880
 once he takes on these 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 colors together with dro pick up the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.810
 people the skal of the bean and this one 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.980
 time I take this very dark brown 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.440
 tending to black 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.820
 as you can see, in this moment I apply the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.860
 color with a brush just 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.440
 simply because it is much more precise 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.050
 and I usually use this brush for 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.490
 trace the shape of my makeup one 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.260
 time I did well 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.390
 the shape of my change makeup 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.910
 definitely brush like you see 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 always in mine in my videos for a 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.910
 bigger brush 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.860
 as you see at the moment I'm using 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.560
 one of the new brushes on the tt cic 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.420
 bought some time ago and try to up 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.830
 sea ​​this very dark brown with 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.350
 other colors we had applied 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.970
 previously here it changes again to 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.980
 brush as you have marrying that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.930
 in that two golds at a 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.660
 little brownish brown little 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.640
 dark and I try to add again well 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.770
 all because, as you know, I am 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.040
 a little fixed with nuances and mi 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.210
 like that one is very perfect 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.940
 time I finished here 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.980
 I'll go and get a small brush and give up 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.710
 always with the same brown color 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.640
 very dark I 'm going to put it under the 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.890
 lower lashes 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.530
 I, as usual, set the corner 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.500
 outside of the eye and I apply this 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.970
 humberto up to half duck down ok 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.970
 now I'm going to take this pigment 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.950
 that of the maxi called apple tree I take it 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.260
 with a silky synthetic utility knife 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.730
 very small and as you see in this 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.300
 moment I apply the internal maul 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 eye 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.800
 as you know the pigments had to 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.870
 be very careful simply because 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.900
 if no breath in dust can fall 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.109
 all over her face and then it was something 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.970
 a little annoyed however I take little 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.440
 at a time and try to tap him 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.090
 slowly 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.280
 ok right after he went to get another 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.380
 pigment to this is called pink bronze 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.969
 it is a very very very beautiful color 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.129
 particular and I take it with penis 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.779
 quite large the panel that 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.909
 I'm using right now it's from 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:40.699
 emanuela biffoli as I always tell you 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.909
 costs very little around 3 euros 23 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.860
 euro and as you can see I apply this color 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.369
 immediately after the color they had 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.829
 applied previously or less 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:54.709
 practically on the eyelid, however 

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:56.719
 the center as you see I try to 

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:59.119
 put this pigment a little bit to 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.549
 above me this is not created 

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:04.219
 the same thing we are going to do 

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:06.829
 against saying that I always take it from myself 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.049
 always with the same brush and this 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:12.949
 in particular it will go a bit above 

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:16.429
 dark brown eyeshadow and a little above and 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.110
 pink bronze simply because so from 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:20.239
 this nuance effect that a 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.039
 I like how you see I try to 

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:24.469
 intensify the color as much as possible 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:29.299
 so we appreciate even a little bit of 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:31.159
 this color is ruby red and immediately after 

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:34.579
 I brush a little more again 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:37.369
 great to fade all right ok now 

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:39.409
 I'll take it again this time 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:41.599
 however with small angular brushes 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.759
 and how you see the increase under the lashes 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.649
 lower on the part that remained 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.360
 free 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:50.239
 once we have applied here 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.419
 this pigment we will go back to 

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:55.459
 rus kerr the agenda of this Kiko 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.229
 time using a pen pens pen sto 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.129
 using this color shampoo also a lot 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.199
 beautiful 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.659
 I use it both to light below 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.129
 the eyebrow arch that fades 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.419
 eyeshadow on the inside corner 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.519
 eye 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.649
 I'm all the edges of me not 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:12.679
 simply because when you succeed in 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:14.659
 understand well though seeing if you live 

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:18.169
 sees the detachment between the pigment and 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.729
 the color of my skin let's say one 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.499
 Once we have done this I go to 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.019
 do my usual regal eyeliner 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.479
 but this time it's not so double 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:29.209
 it is quite thin always with the 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.149
 codeine because as I said it is in my opinion 

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:35.779
 the linear form that I'm fine with that 

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:37.069
 I also like aprico slowly this 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.439
 I really like eyeliner 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.459
 simply because it slips a lot 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.279
 quickly 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:45.350
 I talk about black tracking mag and a little 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.150
 expensive this yes though 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.850
 very good the only thing I don't 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.100
 like and still not very dark 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.400
 I have to go over it several times 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.900
 I have an intense black color I apply 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.060
 always the same eyeliner under the 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.610
 lower eyelashes but very little using 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.630
 let's say the dirty and closed brush 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.910
 towards the outer corner 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.060
 now we're going to put mascara instead 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.130
 stop profit streaming of the essence that 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.590
 I really like it simply because 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.480
 It gives me a nice fake eyelashes effect this 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.640
 as a mascara a heavier poor man 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.140
 always have with respect to that of 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.740
 I also like miss broadway stand 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:24.020
 this much and nothing I apply it 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.150
 both above and below 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.740
 now instead it will go to take the course 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.900
 neither husband nor grain 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.070
 I use the iridescent red part and how 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.350
 you see I put it in the internal rhyme 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.550
 eye 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.350
 immediately after I will go to do mine 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.180
 eyebrows with the usual pencil of the 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.970
 essence that I really like is the 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.740
 number 02 brown once I have 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.860
 drawn to the eyebrows went to 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:48.050
 smoke it and then go to fix it 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.050
 with the usual but scaringia of the essence 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.540
 written to you know that I like it a lot and it is 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.030
 this one here is simply enough 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.440
 comb the eyebrows and make-up 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.330
 will be over 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.860
 the wheelbase things all and I hope there is 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.920
 both liked this trick is a lot
