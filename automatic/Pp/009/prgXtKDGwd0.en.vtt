00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
two sets of eyes just in case I stuff

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.209 
two sets of eyes just in case I stuff
one<00:00:54.670> up<00:00:54.880> and<00:00:55.059> in<00:00:55.739> chinchilla<00:00:56.739> if<00:00:56.980> you're<00:00:57.130> going

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
one up and in chinchilla if you're going

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.040 
one up and in chinchilla if you're going
to<00:00:57.399> do<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.579> little<00:00:57.850> spots<00:00:58.270> like<00:00:58.450> this<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.809> can

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
to do a little spots like this you can

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.740 
to do a little spots like this you can
stuff<00:00:59.320> it<00:00:59.440> up<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.680> lot<00:01:00.210> normally<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.420> chin

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
stuff it up a lot normally in chin

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.229 
stuff it up a lot normally in chin
Calais<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.170> would<00:01:02.590> do<00:01:03.070> probably<00:01:03.760> one<00:01:03.910> big

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
Calais you would do probably one big

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.410 
Calais you would do probably one big
square<00:01:05.039> block<00:01:06.039> of<00:01:06.280> color<00:01:06.789> for<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.179> whole

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
square block of color for the whole

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.739 
square block of color for the whole
plate<00:01:07.780> now<00:01:08.499> make<00:01:08.740> sure<00:01:08.770> those<00:01:09.100> eyes<00:01:09.369> fit<00:01:09.850> now

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
plate now make sure those eyes fit now

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.639 
plate now make sure those eyes fit now
so<00:01:11.170> normal<00:01:11.709> intaglio<00:01:12.159> printmaking<00:01:12.759> goes<00:01:13.299> I'm

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
so normal intaglio printmaking goes I'm

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.870 
so normal intaglio printmaking goes I'm
dampening<00:01:14.649> up<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.979> paper<00:01:15.219> putting<00:01:15.729> in

I<00:01:17.100> am<00:01:18.100> inking<00:01:18.909> up<00:01:20.219> it's<00:01:21.219> important<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.880> use<00:01:22.029> an

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
I am inking up it's important to use an

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.699 
I am inking up it's important to use an
oil-based<00:01:22.539> ink<00:01:23.049> here<00:01:23.350> if<00:01:23.499> you<00:01:23.649> use

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
oil-based ink here if you use

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.039 
oil-based ink here if you use
water-based<00:01:24.490> ink<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.090> can<00:01:25.270> react<00:01:25.569> with<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.779> glue

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
water-based ink it can react with a glue

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.179 
water-based ink it can react with a glue
just<00:01:26.439> smudge<00:01:26.859> and<00:01:27.069> smear<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:29.619> those<00:01:29.799> who<00:01:30.069> are

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
just smudge and smear for those who are

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.910 
just smudge and smear for those who are
already<00:01:30.899> familiar<00:01:31.899> with<00:01:32.200> integrally<00:01:32.829> Oh

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
already familiar with integrally Oh

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.949 
already familiar with integrally Oh
processes<00:01:33.819> you<00:01:33.999> know<00:01:34.179> exactly<00:01:34.539> what<00:01:34.840> I'm

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
processes you know exactly what I'm

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.289 
processes you know exactly what I'm
doing<00:01:34.990> here<00:01:35.740> though<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:36.399> I<00:01:36.670> not<00:01:36.909> probably

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
doing here though so I not probably

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.989 
doing here though so I not probably
should<00:01:37.450> look<00:01:37.840> up<00:01:38.020> dry<00:01:38.319> point<00:01:38.649> or<00:01:38.829> etching<00:01:39.249> so

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
should look up dry point or etching so

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.639 
should look up dry point or etching so
basically<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.599> ink<00:01:40.749> goes<00:01:40.959> into<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.380> grooves

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
basically the ink goes into the grooves

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.260 
basically the ink goes into the grooves
I<00:01:42.009> rub<00:01:42.579> off<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.729> surface<00:01:43.329> now<00:01:44.849> now<00:01:45.849> comes<00:01:46.149> a

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
I rub off the surface now now comes a

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.230 
I rub off the surface now now comes a
tricky<00:01:46.450> bit<00:01:46.859> I'm<00:01:47.859> putting<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.669> little<00:01:49.029> bit<00:01:49.119> of

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
tricky bit I'm putting a little bit of

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.399 
tricky bit I'm putting a little bit of
glue<00:01:49.659> on<00:01:49.929> each<00:01:50.259> one<00:01:50.709> of<00:01:50.859> these<00:01:51.749> bits<00:01:52.749> of<00:01:53.020> tissue

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
glue on each one of these bits of tissue

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.879 
glue on each one of these bits of tissue
paper<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:55.450> very<00:01:55.779> carefully<00:01:56.409> putting<00:01:56.709> it

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
paper and very very carefully putting it

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.849 
paper and very very carefully putting it
on<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.189> plate<00:01:57.340> but<00:01:57.729> glue<00:01:58.029> side<00:01:58.270> up<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:58.899> the

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
on the plate but glue side up so the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.849 
on the plate but glue side up so the
glue<00:02:00.009> facing<00:02:00.549> up<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:00.999> serve<00:02:01.840> really<00:02:02.289> hard<00:02:02.619> so

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
glue facing up and serve really hard so

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.620 
glue facing up and serve really hard so
when<00:02:03.009> we<00:02:03.130> put<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.459> paper<00:02:03.669> down<00:02:03.999> the<00:02:04.209> glue<00:02:04.359> will

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
when we put the paper down the glue will

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.710 
when we put the paper down the glue will
stick<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.989> the<00:02:05.109> paper

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.070 

and<00:02:09.130> into<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.250> press<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.729> goes<00:02:13.450> nice<00:02:14.450> big

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and into the press it goes nice big

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
and into the press it goes nice big
expensive<00:02:16.070> press

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.309 

and<00:02:20.870> out<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.260> other<00:02:21.409> side<00:02:21.799> have<00:02:22.579> a<00:02:22.610> look

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
and out the other side have a look

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.660 
and out the other side have a look
hopefully<00:02:24.319> if<00:02:24.469> this<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.859> worked<00:02:27.189> it's<00:02:28.189> ticking

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
hopefully if this is worked it's ticking

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.110 
hopefully if this is worked it's ticking
it<00:02:29.569> looks<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.230> has<00:02:30.409> worked<00:02:31.060> beauty<00:02:34.120> so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
it looks like it has worked beauty so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.699 
it looks like it has worked beauty so
you<00:02:35.239> have<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.420> look<00:02:35.569> at<00:02:35.689> that<00:02:35.959> basically<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
you have a look at that basically it

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.920 
you have a look at that basically it
looks<00:02:36.799> like<00:02:37.010> I've<00:02:37.159> hand<00:02:37.459> colored<00:02:37.819> it<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.810> I've

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
looks like I've hand colored it so I've

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.349 
looks like I've hand colored it so I've
used<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.379> tissue<00:02:39.620> paper<00:02:39.769> there<00:02:40.430> as<00:02:40.700> spot

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
used the tissue paper there as spot

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.710 
used the tissue paper there as spot
color<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.980> basically<00:02:43.239> fuses<00:02:44.239> into<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
color and it basically fuses into the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.289 
color and it basically fuses into the
paper<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.739> well<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.220> cannot<00:02:46.609> see<00:02:46.909> where<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
paper so well you cannot see where the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.110 
paper so well you cannot see where the
joins<00:02:47.629> are<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.739> Schinkel<00:02:49.219> a<00:02:49.310> method<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
joins are the Schinkel a method the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.509 
joins are the Schinkel a method the
tissue<00:02:50.359> paper<00:02:50.829> embeds<00:02:51.829> into<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.280> paper

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
tissue paper embeds into the paper

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.640 
tissue paper embeds into the paper
becomes<00:02:52.970> part<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:53.870> other<00:02:53.989> paper<00:02:54.319> like<00:02:54.620> a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
becomes part of the other paper like a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.589 
becomes part of the other paper like a
paper<00:02:54.980> making<00:02:55.430> technique<00:02:55.939> and<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:57.530> is

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
paper making technique and that is

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.720 
paper making technique and that is
Schinkel<00:02:59.599> a
