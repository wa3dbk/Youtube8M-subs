00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
going lightly over where I did the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.810 
going lightly over where I did the
application<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:44.640> should

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
application just like that and it should

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.060 
application just like that and it should
look<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.170> am<00:02:46.710> now<00:02:47.010> taking

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
look like this for now I am now taking

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.280 
look like this for now I am now taking
Matt<00:02:47.700> 329<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.020> applying<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.480> right<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
Matt 329 and applying that right at the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.740 
Matt 329 and applying that right at the
upper<00:02:52.710> crease<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.940> blending<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.420> in

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
upper crease and just blending that in

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.680 
upper crease and just blending that in
lightly<00:03:04.820> just<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.030> give<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.450> nice

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
lightly just to give it a nice

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:21.050 
lightly just to give it a nice
transition<00:03:07.020> color

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.260 

just<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:22.110> that

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.480 

when<00:03:27.870> applying<00:03:28.230> eye<00:03:28.500> shadows<00:03:28.950> really<00:03:29.340> it's

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
when applying eye shadows really it's

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.150 
when applying eye shadows really it's
not<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.000> hard<00:03:30.330> um<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.260> key<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.830> just

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
not that hard um the key is to just

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.350 
not that hard um the key is to just
blend<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:34.460> just<00:03:35.460> remembering<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.180> does

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
blend and just remembering that it does

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.380 
blend and just remembering that it does
not<00:03:36.620> truly<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.100> be<00:03:38.250> perfect<00:03:38.790> who<00:03:38.970> wants

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
you in the middle of the application

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.350 
you in the middle of the application
because<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.160> could<00:03:41.310> always<00:03:41.430> go<00:03:41.700> back<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:42.210> and

correct and blend and good thing for

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.300 
correct and blend and good thing for
concealers<00:03:45.960> because<00:03:46.350> we<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.890> correct<00:03:47.070> any

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
concealers because we can correct any

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.420
