00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.190 

all<00:00:36.680> right<00:00:36.770> let's<00:00:37.010> start<00:00:37.220> with<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:38.200> memory

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
all right let's start with the memory

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:57.420 
all right let's start with the memory
man<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:41.230> 1100<00:00:42.230> Mille<00:00:42.440> second<00:00:42.890> version

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:05.640 

you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:40.740 

let's<00:01:06.650> go<00:01:06.860> over<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.750> 550

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.970 

there's<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.240> tiny<00:02:20.600> bit<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.960> clock<00:02:21.350> noise<00:02:21.650> with

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
there's a tiny bit of clock noise with

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.510 
there's a tiny bit of clock noise with
the<00:02:22.100> 550<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.970> don't<00:02:23.270> know<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:23.510> it's<00:02:23.660> audible<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
the 550 I don't know if it's audible and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.180 
the 550 I don't know if it's audible and
the<00:02:25.520> speakers<00:02:26.650> let's<00:02:27.650> engage<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:28.010> little

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
the speakers let's engage a little

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.580 
the speakers let's engage a little

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.500 
clock noise as the delay time gets

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:57.750 
clock noise as the delay time gets
longer<00:07:50.590> and<00:07:51.250> I<00:07:53.880> prefer<00:07:55.050> this<00:07:56.050> one<00:07:56.400> smoother<00:07:57.400> to

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:57.760 
longer and I prefer this one smoother to

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.340 
longer and I prefer this one smoother to
me<00:07:58.620> quieter<00:07:59.620> and<00:08:00.390> it<00:08:01.390> is<00:08:01.570> getting<00:08:01.930> more<00:08:02.290> and

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:02.350 
me quieter and it is getting more and

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.670 
me quieter and it is getting more and
more<00:08:02.470> harder<00:08:02.890> to<00:08:03.010> find<00:08:03.340> but<00:08:03.730> it's<00:08:04.210> worth<00:08:04.540> it<00:08:04.720> so

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 
more harder to find but it's worth it so

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.110 
more harder to find but it's worth it so
that's<00:08:06.280> my<00:08:06.490> opinion

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 
that's my opinion

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.270 
that's my opinion
