prime and everyday lenses now in
everyday<00:00:20.699> lens<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> probably<00:00:21.359> something<00:00:21.630> you

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
everyday lens is probably something you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
everyday lens is probably something you
got<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:22.500> camera<00:00:22.769> kit<00:00:23.070> when<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.369> bought

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
got in your camera kit when you bought

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.779 
got in your camera kit when you bought
it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.429 
it
most<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.420> come<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.840> lens<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
most of them come with a lens and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.870 
most of them come with a lens and
generally<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.010> come<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> lens<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> has

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
generally you come with a lens that has

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
generally you come with a lens that has
a<00:00:27.029> basic<00:00:27.660> amount<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> zoom<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.500> too<00:00:28.769> many

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
a basic amount of zoom and not too many

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.550 
a basic amount of zoom and not too many
frills<00:00:29.400> these<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.300> good<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.689> tooling<00:00:31.439> around

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
frills these are good for tooling around

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.130 
frills these are good for tooling around
and<00:00:32.250> getting<00:00:32.489> used<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.300> camera<00:00:33.690> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and getting used to the camera but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690 
and getting used to the camera but
chances<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.770> you'll<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> get<00:00:35.370> different

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
chances are you'll want to get different

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.910 
chances are you'll want to get different
lenses<00:00:35.969> fairly<00:00:36.360> quickly<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.770> thing

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
lenses fairly quickly now the one thing

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.170 
lenses fairly quickly now the one thing
you<00:00:38.010> might<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> consider<00:00:38.640> beyond<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you might want to consider beyond the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.490 
you might want to consider beyond the
lens<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> came<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.020> camera<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
lens that came with your camera is a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
lens that came with your camera is a
prime<00:00:41.010> lens<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.399> prime<00:00:41.610> lens<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> essentially

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
prime lens so prime lens is essentially

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170 
prime lens so prime lens is essentially
a<00:00:42.480> fixed<00:00:42.930> focal<00:00:43.320> length<00:00:43.530> lens<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.520> case<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a fixed focal length lens this case it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.959 
a fixed focal length lens this case it
is<00:00:45.750> 50<00:00:46.170> millimeter<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.950> doesn't<00:00:47.489> zoom<00:00:47.700> or

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
is 50 millimeter it doesn't zoom or

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
is 50 millimeter it doesn't zoom or
anything<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.289> very<00:00:49.500> few

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
anything like that it has very few

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.619 
anything like that it has very few
moving<00:00:49.950> parts<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> has<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
moving parts because all it has is the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.100 
moving parts because all it has is the
focus<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.149> advantage<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
focus on this and the one advantage of a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
focus on this and the one advantage of a
prime<00:00:55.350> lens<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.829> typically<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:56.910> better

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
prime lens is typically it has better

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.560 
prime lens is typically it has better
optics<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:58.170> zoom<00:00:59.100> lens<00:00:59.309> you<00:01:00.059> end<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
optics with zoom lens you end up with a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.970 
optics with zoom lens you end up with a
bunch<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.870> moving<00:01:01.079> parts<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> have

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
bunch of moving parts and you have

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.030 
bunch of moving parts and you have
issues<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.600> move<00:01:03.840> things<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> from

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
issues as you move things to and from

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
issues as you move things to and from
you<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.430> different<00:01:05.939> clusters<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.630> glass

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you have different clusters of glass

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
you have different clusters of glass
inside<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> much<00:01:08.369> simpler<00:01:08.729> lens<00:01:08.970> so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
inside this is a much simpler lens so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
inside this is a much simpler lens so
the<00:01:09.840> ability<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.619> most<00:01:10.979> prime<00:01:11.400> lenses<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the ability for most prime lenses to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.560 
the ability for most prime lenses to
have<00:01:12.180> very<00:01:12.450> clear<00:01:13.049> optics<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> much<00:01:14.400> higher<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
have very clear optics is much higher so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450 
have very clear optics is much higher so
it's<00:01:15.930> worth<00:01:16.259> doing<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.040> really

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it's worth doing that if you want really

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's worth doing that if you want really
clear<00:01:17.939> shots<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.259> other<00:01:19.380> thing<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> because

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
clear shots the other thing is because

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
clear shots the other thing is because
it<00:01:20.100> has<00:01:20.220> less<00:01:20.430> moving<00:01:20.670> parts<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.570> it's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it has less moving parts in this is it's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
it has less moving parts in this is it's
also<00:01:22.229> lighter<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:23.430> means<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.180> don't<00:01:24.299> have

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
also lighter which means you don't have

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
also lighter which means you don't have
all<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> mechanisms<00:01:25.950> inside<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
all of the mechanisms inside here

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
all of the mechanisms inside here
weighing<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.720> means<00:01:27.930> ultimately

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
weighing it down which means ultimately

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
weighing it down which means ultimately
when<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.549> carrying<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.939> around<00:01:30.090> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
when you are carrying this around it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
when you are carrying this around it's
lighter<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:30.960> shoulder<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.770> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lighter on your shoulder and if you have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
lighter on your shoulder and if you have
it<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.250> kit<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.610> lighter<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.119> kit

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
it in your kit it's lighter in your kit

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
it in your kit it's lighter in your kit
the<00:01:34.200> other<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> does<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> teaches

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the other thing it does is it teaches

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.359 
the other thing it does is it teaches
discipline<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> walk<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
discipline so you have to walk to and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.030 
discipline so you have to walk to and
from<00:01:38.549> your<00:01:38.790> subject<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.170> frame<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
from your subject and and frame it the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.210 
from your subject and and frame it the
way<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:43.140> camera<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.040> have

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
way that you want to in camera you have

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.149 
way that you want to in camera you have
to<00:01:44.460> walk<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> shot<00:01:46.320> rather<00:01:46.590> than<00:01:46.890> just

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to walk to the shot rather than just

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
to walk to the shot rather than just
hitting<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> zoom<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.000> getting<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.079> way

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
hitting a zoom and getting it that way

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
hitting a zoom and getting it that way
so<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.490> learn<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.329> makes<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.600> good

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so you really learn what makes a good

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.560 
so you really learn what makes a good
shot<00:01:52.040> by<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> moving<00:01:54.180> around<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
shot by going out and moving around and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
shot by going out and moving around and
doing<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> downside<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.100> mentioned

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
doing it now the downside as I mentioned

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.310 
doing it now the downside as I mentioned
is<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.240> walk<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> from<00:01:58.170> your

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
is you do have to walk to and from your

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
is you do have to walk to and from your
subject<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.950> order<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> shot<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
subject in order to get the shot you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
subject in order to get the shot you
want<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.229> zoom<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.950> actually

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
want you can just zoom it actually

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.920 
want you can just zoom it actually
requires<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.030> bit<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.509> work<00:02:03.750> so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
requires a little bit more work so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
requires a little bit more work so
that's<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> downside<00:02:04.939> we<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
that's a bit of a downside we have the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.479 
that's a bit of a downside we have the
downside<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.049> prime<00:02:07.290> lens<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.160> your

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
downside on the prime lens is that your

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.059 
downside on the prime lens is that your
bag<00:02:08.670> will<00:02:09.030> get<00:02:09.330> heavier<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.590> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.950> have

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
bag will get heavier if you want to have

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.710 
bag will get heavier if you want to have
a<00:02:11.099> whole<00:02:11.340> pile<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> different<00:02:12.060> lenses<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.510> top

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
a whole pile of different lenses on top

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.530 
a whole pile of different lenses on top
of<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.260> not

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
of this so it's not

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.050 
of this so it's not
does<00:02:13.719> versatile<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.489> everyday<00:02:15.849> lens

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
does versatile as as the everyday lens

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.789 
does versatile as as the everyday lens
because<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.659> can't<00:02:16.900> zoom<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.319> have<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.650> have

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
because you can't zoom you have to have

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.589 
because you can't zoom you have to have
another<00:02:18.040> lens<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.670> achieves<00:02:19.150> different

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
another lens that achieves different

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.720 
another lens that achieves different
effects<00:02:19.900> keep<00:02:20.859> that<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.159> mind<00:02:21.340> when<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.609> get

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
effects keep that in mind when you get

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.039 
effects keep that in mind when you get
that<00:02:21.909> you<00:02:22.180> may<00:02:22.329> want<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.599> get<00:02:22.719> some<00:02:22.780> other

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
that you may want to get some other

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:23.789 
that you may want to get some other
lenses<00:02:23.439> as<00:02:23.590> well

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
lenses as well

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.789 
lenses as well
however<00:02:24.430> again<00:02:24.909> for<00:02:25.359> a<00:02:25.420> good<00:02:25.540> everyday<00:02:25.989> lens

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
however again for a good everyday lens

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.380 
however again for a good everyday lens
that<00:02:27.069> doesn't<00:02:27.129> have<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.700> moving<00:02:27.939> parts<00:02:28.239> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
that doesn't have the moving parts a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.349 
that doesn't have the moving parts a
prime<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.109> a<00:02:29.140> great<00:02:29.500> lens<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.920> consider<00:02:30.359> don't

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
prime is a great lens to consider don't
