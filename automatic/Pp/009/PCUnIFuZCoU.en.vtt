00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello and welcome to our video 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.609
 manual of the week everyone does 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.720
 can not buy his bike in 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.730
 specialty shops 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.349
 that's why today I'm going 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.719
 show you how the bike arrives 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.519
 to your home your order 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.539
 has finally arrived and nothing better than 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:24.289
 to go open the cateau is open 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.109
 you can now get out the bike 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.060
 once the bike is out of the box 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.130
 then you have to remove the plastic 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 protective 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.600
 be careful with your brushes only to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 not damage the cables and that the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.649
 saddle do not get lost montella 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 directly to mount the wheel before the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.070
 first thing to do is to remove the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.070
 brake safety here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 the new bike but we already had them 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.119
 pedals that's why I'm going to them 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 use now the most important 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 for the pedals and to have a button to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 right and left you will find on the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.020
 right pedal a little air and on the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.490
 left a little she from the front efsa 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 to assemble the pedals you from 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.330
 degrease a little the axes you can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 either fix them with a wrench 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.490
 15 or with the matching Allen key 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.340
 just squeeze the pedals with the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 essential hand is too strong either 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.619
 it starts to look like a bike but 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.270
 he still misses the handlebars for that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:02:02.340
 we have to extract the clamping screws 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:02:07.649
 of the gallows to continue we can 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.690
 introduce the handlebars into the gallows and 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.690
 life is the base again 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.410
 for the moment just leave the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.450
 screw not completely screwed and we will finish 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.610
 of life it's with a key before you 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.830
 aim the guide at we must center 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.810
 and most guides in the Caribbean if 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.800
 brands are easy to locate 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.020
 of the Center 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.930
 he has a next step is to check 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.910
 that the distance between the base of the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.520
 gallows up and down 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.310
 the same it is not necessary that a 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.709
 side they are completely glued and 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.380
 of the other not in addition to that it is 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.790
 as important to properly calculate the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.130
 degree of inclination 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.500
 For this you must put 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.290
 laugh the bike and check if the handlebars 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.239
 you seem ergonomics and rick and you 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.489
 move either forward or towards 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.739
 the back once the handlebars in place 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.019
 we can finish fixing it with 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.910
 a key in the carbon handlebars 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.190
 it is important to apply the rate 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.410
 correct otherwise we risk damaging it 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.070
 to avoid it the best is to use 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.440
 a torque wrench today the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.410
 most gallows have an indicator 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.090
 of torque and when there is 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.519
 marked 6 nm 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.489
 that means you have to apply 6 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.799
 Newton meter maximum 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.840
 that is, this measure indicates the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.180
 maximum value to be given to 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.590
 the sister notice it is recommendable 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:51.090
 national level to support 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:53.730
 perfect degree now the handlebar is 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.489
 fixed however we must not forget 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.859
 before trying the bike to adjust the 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.019
 steering tube otherwise it can get 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.730
 pass this if the gallows and poorly fixed 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.190
 to adjust the directional game 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.480
 you have to unscrew slightly both 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.010
 son 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:19.030
 and then install the headset 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.280
 through the base with a key 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.810
 allen always check the sensitivity 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.640
 bike movements when we 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.140
 lift forward and observe if the 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.960
 guide we can turn alone to the 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.120
 right and left continued sion 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.180
 1 braking with the front wheel brake 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.580
 and moved slightly forward and 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.230
 backwards to see if the game of 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.450
 direction has enough space 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.310
 if he has no more space and the tube of 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.680
 direction can always move with 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.690
 ease one will have to after having put the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.700
 right handlebar again tightened them 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.000
 currencies with the hand then fix it all 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.130
 with a key I do not have any more 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.830
 has recommended that you have a bike 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.590
 nine or a bike loaned always 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.860
 check the elements of insecurity it's 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.320
 to say the handlebars we already checked 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.140
 the vices and the two wheels and have 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.330
 installed the wheel before I will check the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.090
 rear wheel and even fixing the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:18.850
 brakes the wheels must always be 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.620
 inflated this is an individual thing seen 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.840
 that it depends on the width of the tires and 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.510
 of the weight of the person and when he 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.360
 This is a 2004 wheel like the one 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.600
 is the person weighs 70 kg 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.490
 less than two bars 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.440
 approximately 1.7 in the next 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.180
 video i will show you how to adjust 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.950
 the train and how to find 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.950
 the correct position for the saddle
