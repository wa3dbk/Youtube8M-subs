her natural hair and then at the end I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.740 
her natural hair and then at the end I
added<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:14.490> marley<00:00:15.410> twist<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.680> end<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> get

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
added a marley twist at the end so I get

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.720 
added a marley twist at the end so I get
a<00:00:18.960> little<00:00:19.170> bit<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> jail<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.340> putting<00:00:20.580> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
a little bit of jail and just putting it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.509 
a little bit of jail and just putting it
on<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.830> base<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.480> cornrow<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.130> helps

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
on the base of the cornrow it just helps

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.690 
on the base of the cornrow it just helps
it<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> smoother<00:00:31.019> finish<00:00:31.230> especially

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
it to have a smoother finish especially

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.350 
it to have a smoother finish especially
when<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.120> natural<00:00:33.719> hair

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.730 

I'm<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.410> careful<00:00:40.710> around<00:00:44.150> her<00:00:45.150> hairline

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
I'm very careful around her hairline

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.220 
I'm very careful around her hairline
just<00:00:46.740> because<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.970> that's<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.540> very

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
just because you know that's just a very

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.950 
just because you know that's just a very
very<00:00:49.440> fine<00:00:50.870> here<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.890> don't<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.340> pull<00:00:53.960> or

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very fine here you don't want to pull or

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:09.300 
very fine here you don't want to pull or
braid<00:00:55.800> too<00:00:56.100> tight<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.400> there

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
so at the end I just kind of leave it

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.150 
so at the end I just kind of leave it
like<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:14.320> right<00:01:14.590> here<00:01:14.620> is<00:01:14.890> where

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160

all<00:01:58.690> twisted<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.410> then<00:01:59.650> I<00:01:59.680> cross<00:02:00.160> it<00:02:00.369> over

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.900

twisting so to stay tight and then so

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.570 
twisting so to stay tight and then so
there's<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.720> clean<00:02:20.220> continuation<00:02:21.220> from

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
there's like a clean continuation from

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.000 
there's like a clean continuation from
the<00:02:21.760> braid<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.450> twist<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.769> can't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.210 
the braid to the twist so you can't
really<00:02:24.160> see<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.640> lump<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:27.190> hair<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.070> I'll

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
really see a lump of hair and then I'll

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.400 
really see a lump of hair and then I'll
just<00:02:30.430> twist<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.450> here's<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.810> Marley<00:02:35.200> hair

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
here so I place it right on top and then

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.610 
here so I place it right on top and then
I<00:02:41.080> twist<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:44.380> one<00:02:44.620> piece<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.910> direction

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.400 
I twist just one piece in one direction
and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.250> second<00:02:48.940> piece<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.390> twist<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.290> the

and then the second piece I twist in the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.100 
and then the second piece I twist in the
same<00:02:50.650> direction<00:02:51.180> while<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.390> still<00:02:52.750> holding

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
same direction while I'm still holding

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.440 
same direction while I'm still holding
this<00:02:53.230> piece<00:02:53.530> tight<00:02:53.980> tightly<00:02:54.700> twist<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.269> that

this piece tight tightly twist it that
way<00:02:55.600> once<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.350> sections<00:02:56.920> are<00:02:57.370> twisted

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
way once but in sections are twisted

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.990 
way once but in sections are twisted
then<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.570> twist<00:02:58.780> over<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.070> immediately

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
then you can twist over and immediately

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.900 
then you can twist over and immediately
start<00:03:04.900> twisting<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:05.920> again<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.610> twist<00:03:07.480> over

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
start twisting this again and twist over

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.520 
start twisting this again and twist over
so<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> twist<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:12.000> twist<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.810> about<00:03:14.049> three<00:03:14.410> or

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
so I twist and twist for about three or

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.309 
so I twist and twist for about three or
four<00:03:14.799> down<00:03:15.330> until<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.420> feel<00:03:16.630> like<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.200> know

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
four down until I feel like you know

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.850 
four down until I feel like you know
it's<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:17.709> secure

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.940 

and<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.129> just<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.400> way<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:25.739> thicken<00:03:26.739> up

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
and this is just a way to thicken up

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.630 
and this is just a way to thicken up
twist<00:03:27.939> or<00:03:28.209> at<00:03:28.840> length<00:03:29.200> all<00:03:29.590> right<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.489> we<00:03:30.610> are

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
twist or at length all right so we are

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.119 
twist or at length all right so we are
done<00:03:30.909> with<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.269> majority<00:03:31.629> of<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:32.890> did

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
done with the majority of it so I did

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.690 
done with the majority of it so I did
this<00:03:33.370> side<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.239> then<00:03:34.390> we<00:03:34.420> did<00:03:34.689> this<00:03:34.900> side<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
this side and then we did this side and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.530 
this side and then we did this side and
then<00:03:36.909> I<00:03:37.000> did<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.269> top<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:38.200> straight<00:03:38.500> back<00:03:39.540> so

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
then I did the top just straight back so

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.089 
then I did the top just straight back so
that's<00:03:40.659> pretty<00:03:40.930> much<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.379> so<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:41.829> just<00:03:41.980> have

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
that's pretty much it so we just have

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.069 
that's pretty much it so we just have
this<00:03:42.220> little<00:03:42.430> piece<00:03:42.730> left<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.569> am<00:03:43.689> going<00:03:43.900> to

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.809 
this little piece left and I am going to
do<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> single<00:03:44.560> twist<00:03:44.769> here<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.159> then<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.640> will

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
do a single twist here and then I will
