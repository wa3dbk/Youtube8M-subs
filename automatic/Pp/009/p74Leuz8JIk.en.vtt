project this one is fairly easy although

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
project this one is fairly easy although
you<00:00:26.250> might<00:00:26.460> need<00:00:26.640> an<00:00:26.760> extra<00:00:27.029> set<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> hands<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you might need an extra set of hands to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
you might need an extra set of hands to
help<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.960> knock<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.170> out<00:00:28.439> step<00:00:28.949> number<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.369> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
help you knock it out step number one is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.700 
help you knock it out step number one is
to<00:00:29.640> take<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> steak<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.689> string<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.260> lay

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to take a steak and some string and lay

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.350 
to take a steak and some string and lay
out<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> perimeter<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.489> fence<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.180> face

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
out the perimeter of your fence the face

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.790 
out the perimeter of your fence the face
of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> string<00:00:33.840> acts<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> face<00:00:34.590> your

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
of the string acts at the face your

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
of the string acts at the face your
fence<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.190> make<00:00:35.340> sure<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> string<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
fence so make sure that the string is on

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.330 
fence so make sure that the string is on
the<00:00:36.450> outside<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.020> steak<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the outside of your steak and that you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
the outside of your steak and that you
lay<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.790> where<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> front<00:00:40.170> of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
lay it out where you want the front of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
lay it out where you want the front of
your<00:00:40.379> fence<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:41.149> at<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> corners<00:00:42.750> where

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
your fence to be at the corners where

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.270 
your fence to be at the corners where
your<00:00:43.050> lines<00:00:43.260> intersect<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> make

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
your lines intersect you want to make

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
your lines intersect you want to make
sure<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.550> your<00:00:44.700> corners<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.149> square<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
sure that your corners are square so you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
sure that your corners are square so you
don't<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> wonky<00:00:46.829> fence<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
don't have kind of a wonky fence the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
don't have kind of a wonky fence the
easiest<00:00:47.940> way<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> take<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
easiest way to do that is to take and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.720 
easiest way to do that is to take and
measure<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.309> three<00:00:50.820> feet<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.899> direction

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
measure out three feet in one direction

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
measure out three feet in one direction
then<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> other<00:00:54.300> string<00:00:54.719> take<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
then on the other string take and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
then on the other string take and
measure<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.899> four<00:00:57.899> feet<00:00:59.120> Pythagorean

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
measure out four feet Pythagorean

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
measure out four feet Pythagorean
theorem<00:01:00.480> tells<00:01:00.660> us<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.160> when<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> measure

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
theorem tells us that when you measure

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
theorem tells us that when you measure
the<00:01:02.609> diagonal<00:01:03.390> should<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.989> exactly<00:01:04.439> five<00:01:04.650> feet

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the diagonal should be exactly five feet

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
the diagonal should be exactly five feet
between<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.339> two<00:01:05.369> points<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> marked<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
between the two points you marked that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.640 
between the two points you marked that
means<00:01:06.990> you're<00:01:07.500> building<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> square<00:01:08.520> corner<00:01:08.820> oh

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
means you're building a square corner oh

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
means you're building a square corner oh
yeah<00:01:10.680> five<00:01:11.310> feet

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
yeah five feet

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.240 
yeah five feet
thanks<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> theorem<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.920> built<00:01:14.100> my

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
thanks for the theorem you just built my

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.820 
thanks for the theorem you just built my
fence<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.210> work<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
got your whole fence lined up that's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
got your whole fence lined up that's
going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> act<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.320> template<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.009> where

you dig your post holes and also where
you<00:01:22.380> set<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.650> fence<00:01:22.979> next<00:01:23.520> step<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.330> dig

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you set your fence next step is to dig

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.870 
you set your fence next step is to dig
your<00:01:25.170> post<00:01:25.560> holes<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> want<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> do
