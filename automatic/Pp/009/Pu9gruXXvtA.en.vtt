this I actually got to like open up a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.710 
this I actually got to like open up a
little<00:00:23.250> bit<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.640> gotta<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.090> your<00:00:24.180> CC<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
little bit we gotta do your CC and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.240 
little bit we gotta do your CC and
shipped<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.050> got<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.439> open<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.769> anyway

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.910 
comet was called is I'm fucking hopeless
but<00:00:29.880> reversing<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.510> shammy<00:00:30.869> another<00:00:31.500> chamois

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
but reversing a shammy another chamois

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
but reversing a shammy another chamois
so<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> resto<00:00:33.120> le<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.899> got<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
so I got a resto le and then we got a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.709 
so I got a resto le and then we got a
frost<00:00:34.469> dk<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.430> lot<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.969> decays<00:00:36.300> today<00:00:36.540> actually

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
frost dk a lot of decays today actually

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
frost dk a lot of decays today actually
were<00:00:36.930> reversed<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> strat<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.280> was<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
were reversed and the strat here was to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
were reversed and the strat here was to
kill<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> DK<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.809> decays<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
kill the DK because decays in the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.110 
kill the DK because decays in the
necrotic<00:00:40.680> scan<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.280> damage<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.940> heels

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
necrotic scan do some damage to my heels

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.639 
necrotic scan do some damage to my heels
which<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.540> want<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> happen<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> saw

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
which I don't want to happen and you saw

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.080 
which I don't want to happen and you saw
the<00:00:43.710> start<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.309> pop<00:00:44.579> burst<00:00:44.820> that's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the start there me pop burst that's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
the start there me pop burst that's
because<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.510> had<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> chemin<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
because I actually had the chemin a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.529 
because I actually had the chemin a
really<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.160> CC<00:00:47.460> chamber<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:48.180> close<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
really good CC chamber really close to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.850 
really good CC chamber really close to
killing<00:00:48.719> IDK<00:00:49.140> thought<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.530> add<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
killing IDK thought we could add them so

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.920 
killing IDK thought we could add them so
i<00:00:49.890> pop<00:00:50.129> burst<00:00:50.370> went<00:00:50.640> berserk<00:00:50.940> didn't<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.780> him

me starting here with the trap get on
that<00:00:56.070> fucking<00:00:56.309> DK<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> lot<00:00:57.420> of

damage once as a unfortunately I
actually<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.719> testing<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
actually was testing this out in the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
actually was testing this out in the
arena<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.219> i<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.430> using<00:01:02.579> binding<00:01:03.090> shot

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
arena where i was using binding shot

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
arena where i was using binding shot
instead<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> sleep<00:01:03.840> shot<00:01:04.019> i<00:01:04.260> say

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
instead of sleep shot i say

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.289 
instead of sleep shot i say
unfortunately<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> wasn't<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.909> unfortunate

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
unfortunately it wasn't an unfortunate

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.640 
unfortunately it wasn't an unfortunate
because<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.780> seemed<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> work<00:01:07.290> out<00:01:07.439> pretty

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
because it seemed to work out pretty

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.469 
because it seemed to work out pretty
well<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> first<00:01:08.670> couple<00:01:08.880> bd's<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> i'm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
well at the first couple bd's that i'm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
well at the first couple bd's that i'm
doing<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.960> without<00:01:10.409> sleep<00:01:10.710> shot<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
doing this with without sleep shot a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
doing this with without sleep shot a
kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> didn't<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
kind of like I didn't really know what I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.630 
kind of like I didn't really know what I
was<00:01:13.080> doing<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.710> bond<00:01:13.950> shots<00:01:14.310> were<00:01:14.460> off

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
was doing on my bond shots were off

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
was doing on my bond shots were off
there<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.000> stupid<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.990> didn't<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> put

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
there like stupid I didn't know to put

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
there like stupid I didn't know to put
on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> DPS<00:01:17.130> run<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> heels<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.150> started

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
on the DPS run to the heels I started

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.420

you<00:06:02.069> actually<00:06:02.339> trinket<00:06:02.699> out<00:06:02.819> scatter<00:06:03.150> which

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
you actually trinket out scatter which

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.240 
you actually trinket out scatter which
is<00:06:03.389> a<00:06:03.449> completely<00:06:03.810> wrong<00:06:04.080> thing<00:06:04.319> to<00:06:04.349> do<00:06:04.589> and<00:06:05.069> we
