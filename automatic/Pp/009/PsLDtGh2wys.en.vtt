00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.790
 hello thank you for watching this news 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.200
 video of the battles today we 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.580
 let's introduce him to him both 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.540
 techniques 8273 so today it's fine 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:41.460
 to be the model v after the model so 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:44.850
 it's a big up with a good arm 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.379
 so to start he can turn 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 simply with the roque on his 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:57.970
 roof so here's demonstration is 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:02.559
 then a ski is simple first of 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:06.070
 behind he opened he has two small 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.650
 suspension so that comes out right at 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 go from a mini boss how do you or 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:18.189
 not and in close-up 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.869
 we'll say before pivoting so that's 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:27.130
 say if now there is a bump and 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:30.640
 so it lava we will drive it goes 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 go back down and it will be there nothing to pivot 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.570
 which will not interfere really here it is 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.060
 a plus whatever they have improved they 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.480
 have added the agent with this template 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.660
 there is also a vision of a charter of 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.950
 little bosses that can be built who I 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.510
 believe at the end of the month she then 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 so the big features we're going 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:01.300
 to say it's the arm in the back so he has 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 put names will say here we can nothing 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.940
 to be with impunity 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.369
 so we have a first wheel here that 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.690
 allows to go up or down the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.540
 arm so the maximum down I believe that 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.909
 that's how it can affect and the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.860
 maximum in it's going to be here so to little 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.230
 near the hook will be about 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.640
 level 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.599
 so it's not practical to put 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.260
 something had then were these 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.900
 holes that will serve to bring down 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.709
 so to slacken the hook or so 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.709
 makes it go up 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.489
 here I think that's all for this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.489
 video thanks and bye
