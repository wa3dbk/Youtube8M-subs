00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
you have to be in free aim i think i'd

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.200 
you have to be in free aim i think i'd
switch<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.710> second<00:00:43.129> we<00:00:43.640> play<00:00:43.850> on<00:00:44.000> seven

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
switch that in a second we play on seven

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.930 
switch that in a second we play on seven
sensitivity<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:45.920> find<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:46.220> sensitivity<00:00:46.640> that

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
sensitivity just find a sensitivity that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.130 
sensitivity just find a sensitivity that
works<00:00:47.120> for<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.570> higher<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.989> better

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
works for you the higher the better

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
though again it's just a free aim and i

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.899 
though again it's just a free aim and i
think<00:00:51.409> we<00:00:51.470> do<00:00:51.589> a<00:00:51.620> little<00:00:51.830> cut<00:00:52.280> right<00:00:52.489> here<00:00:52.519> but

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
think we do a little cut right here but

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:53.950 
think we do a little cut right here but
as<00:00:53.000> soon<00:00:53.120> as<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.330> go<00:00:53.449> through<00:00:53.659> this<00:00:53.720> door

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
as soon as you go through this door

and<00:01:08.870> ends<00:01:09.020> kind<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.320> stationary<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:09.860> we'll

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
and ends kind of stationary and we'll

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.620 
and ends kind of stationary and we'll
explain<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.400> here<00:01:10.760> when<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.060> when<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.330> lapse

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
explain that here when it when it lapse

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.109 
explain that here when it when it lapse
is<00:01:11.840> over<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.190> first<00:01:13.490> thing<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.760> you

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
is over so the first thing that you

probably<00:01:14.630> don't<00:01:15.020> notice<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:15.740> there<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.430> a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
probably don't notice is that there is a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.850 
probably don't notice is that there is a
fuel<00:01:17.090> like<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.200> guess<00:01:18.500> that's<00:01:18.680> like<00:01:18.830> a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
fuel like a I guess that's like a

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.250 
fuel like a I guess that's like a
propane<00:01:19.640> tank<00:01:19.880> back<00:01:20.120> there<00:01:20.150> mm-hmm<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.020> on

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260
