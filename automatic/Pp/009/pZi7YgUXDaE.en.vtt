00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.059
 and how they do in the kitchen are good 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.750
 chefs I am very good at cooking and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.270
 a specialty 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.529
 a cooked mate of better specialty and 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:21.110
 I do not cook much and I know how to do something like that and 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.140
 with that I'm satisfied because I allow it 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.090
 ever to eat some roast 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.850
 you had a bad meal 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.890
 your 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.440
 see fides with chicken milanese with 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.330
 puree always look at our mashed and roasted 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.470
 also and if I think a typical meal 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.600
 it was commented to the side and the semama always 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.340
 is also to say the breast are the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.980
 best as a favorite of the Milanese 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.540
 comfortable fried and over there I cook and the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.540
 specialty is baked meat with potatoes 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.900
 I'm not currently cooking much 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.570
 cooking site when I was good 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.729
 agreement there I think I learned several 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.350
 things but nowadays I think the kitchen 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.030
 it's not my thing you have some 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.490
 specialty that although not in not the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.920
 do habitually for now I hope that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.729
 you know you get it right and it could be a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.530
 a milanesa a pasta with the sauce 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.590
 different but but those two things 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.430
 could be the special ones in your 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.850
 favorite dish since childhood 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.400
 and the final milanesas to compose were 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.970
 the preferred dish obviously nowadays 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.370
 after the roast is fundamental the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.500
 Milanese freezes directly there at 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.930
 oven and I make them immediately with potatoes 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.690
 already asked to grana and already 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 ForlÃ­n the two also know they are good 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.160
 chefs and they do milanesas and good the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.800
 kitchens not to do anything to us though 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.990
 now on the internet, it makes the recipe easy and 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.630
 your favorite food which we have already 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.550
 drawn but as to all Argentines by 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.640
 at least the majority raises good insurance 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.090
 of cooking zero premiums 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.800
 to set the table take out the table of the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.690
 dishes and the crockery is made all but 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.500
 well you have to put it there 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.380
 lift put the table or sometimes go to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.100
 buy food help to make but 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.260
 cook but cook and do not cook 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.250
 but what is your favorite food and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.140
 Milanese but there are good things 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.770
 start you have to learn there is no other 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.410
 because I'm seeing only so that I no longer 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.790
 I have here in my kitchen so you have to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.880
 learn which one you discovered is your 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.580
 specialty I do not have much specialty 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.709
 the pastas out there is the easiest thing not 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.380
 I know it's heating the water and putting the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.700
 noodles nothing else this sauce the sauce 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.560
 able to show me my old some 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.660
 I have a friend who is a cook 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.760
 it also pulls me to emit some things 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.920
 but nothing learning we will know which 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.370
 is the specialty of leandro marÃ­n in 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.370
 the kitchen 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.700
 I put a lot of specialty word you 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:13.639
 put pressure or richer for me than 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.340
 cook was stuffed fish well 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.680
 sophisticated internet in the obvious recipe 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.590
