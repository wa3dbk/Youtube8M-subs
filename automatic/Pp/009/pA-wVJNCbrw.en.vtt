this content area there's two additional
features<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> want<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> talk<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.160> both<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
features I want to talk about both of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
features I want to talk about both of
which<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.270> actually<00:00:21.539> hidden<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:21.990> now<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
which are actually hidden right now the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.810 
which are actually hidden right now the
first<00:00:22.980> thing<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> talk<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.519> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
first thing I'm going to talk about is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.310 
first thing I'm going to talk about is
the<00:00:24.029> toolbar<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> second<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.080> next

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the toolbar and the second one the next

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
the toolbar and the second one the next
video<00:00:25.529> we're<00:00:25.619> gonna<00:00:25.680> talk<00:00:25.830> about<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
video we're gonna talk about is the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.200 
video we're gonna talk about is the
filter<00:00:26.910> menu

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
filter menu

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.240 
filter menu
so<00:00:27.810> let's<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.650> toolbar<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
so let's first get to the toolbar and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.560 
so let's first get to the toolbar and
what<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.609> gonna<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> access<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
what we're gonna do to access is

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
what we're gonna do to access is
actually<00:00:30.929> hit<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> hotkey<00:00:31.560> which<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> T<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually hit the hotkey which is T to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
actually hit the hotkey which is T to
bring<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> toolbar<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.780> appears<00:00:34.320> right<00:00:34.380> at

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
bring up the toolbar it appears right at

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.810 
bring up the toolbar it appears right at
the<00:00:34.710> bottom<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.950> our<00:00:35.010> content<00:00:35.340> menu<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the bottom of our content menu and it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
the bottom of our content menu and it
gives<00:00:36.030> us<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.329> bunch<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.780> extra<00:00:37.110> options<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
gives us a bunch of extra options so the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.830 
gives us a bunch of extra options so the
first<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.030> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
first thing I'm going to do actually is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.340 
first thing I'm going to do actually is
shrink<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:41.239> display<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.510> thumbnail<00:00:43.140> size

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
shrink up my display my thumbnail size

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
shrink up my display my thumbnail size
and<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.610> now<00:00:44.640> not<00:00:45.059> only<00:00:45.090> by<00:00:45.390> using

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and I can do so now not only by using

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840 
and I can do so now not only by using
the<00:00:45.809> plus/minus<00:00:46.079> command<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.579> also

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the plus/minus command but I can also

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
the plus/minus command but I can also
just<00:00:48.570> select<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.410> thumbnails

and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.370> shrink<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> size<00:00:51.030> I'm

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and I can just shrink up the size I'm

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
and I can just shrink up the size I'm
also<00:00:52.170> gonna<00:00:52.289> hit<00:00:52.559> tab<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> remove<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.430> left<00:00:53.670> and

right panels as well as hit f5 to remove

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.510 
right panels as well as hit f5 to remove
my<00:00:57.090> identity<00:00:58.079> plate<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
my identity plate that way I have just a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.709 
my identity plate that way I have just a
little<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.789> more<00:00:59.879> working<00:01:00.210> space<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.570> show

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
little bit more working space to show

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
little bit more working space to show
you<00:01:00.809> guys<00:01:00.930> how<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.289> exactly<00:01:01.770> works<00:01:02.010> all

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you guys how this exactly works all

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
you guys how this exactly works all
right<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:02.969> let's<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.239> started<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.260> bottom

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
right so let's get started the bottom

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
right so let's get started the bottom
left<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> toolbar<00:01:05.010> gives<00:01:05.489> us<00:01:05.700> another<00:01:06.420> way

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
left of the toolbar gives us another way

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420 
left of the toolbar gives us another way
of<00:01:06.900> quickly<00:01:07.080> accessing<00:01:07.650> our<00:01:07.799> different<00:01:08.159> view

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
of quickly accessing our different view

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
of quickly accessing our different view
modes<00:01:08.460> inside<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> library<00:01:09.540> module<00:01:09.930> now

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
modes inside the library module now

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.649 
modes inside the library module now
every<00:01:10.950> single<00:01:11.070> module<00:01:11.580> has<00:01:11.880> its<00:01:11.909> own<00:01:12.180> toolbar

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
every single module has its own toolbar

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210 
every single module has its own toolbar
so<00:01:12.900> we'll<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:13.380> each<00:01:13.530> toolbar<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.159> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so we'll go over each toolbar when we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.499 
so we'll go over each toolbar when we
get<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> each<00:01:14.610> module<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.180> each<00:01:15.330> one

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
get to each module and each one

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.789 
get to each module and each one
functions<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.470> differently

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
functions just a little bit differently

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.429 
functions just a little bit differently
based<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.759> module<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.320> can

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
based on that module but for here we can

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.870 
based on that module but for here we can
see<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.650> different<00:01:20.130> view<00:01:20.310> modes<00:01:20.580> starting

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
see our different view modes starting

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
see our different view modes starting
with<00:01:21.000> grid<00:01:21.240> view<00:01:21.509> loop<00:01:22.350> view<00:01:22.650> compare<00:01:23.640> view

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
with grid view loop view compare view

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
with grid view loop view compare view
and<00:01:24.150> survey<00:01:24.960> view<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> it'll<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.070> tell

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and survey view and it'll actually tell

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.740 
and survey view and it'll actually tell
us<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> shortcuts<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.060> next<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> them<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
us the shortcuts right next to them so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.359 
us the shortcuts right next to them so
if<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.869> forget<00:01:28.110> shortcuts<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> another

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
if you forget shortcuts this is another

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
if you forget shortcuts this is another
way<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> quickly<00:01:30.150> changing<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.290> view<00:01:31.590> modes

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
way of quickly changing the view modes

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.410 
way of quickly changing the view modes
as<00:01:31.979> well<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.280> viewing<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> shortcuts<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
as well as viewing the shortcuts for the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
as well as viewing the shortcuts for the
different<00:01:33.810> view<00:01:33.930> modes<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.799> by<00:01:34.920> clicking<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
different view modes so by clicking it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.440 
different view modes so by clicking it
this<00:01:35.430> will<00:01:35.579> take<00:01:35.729> me<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> loop<00:01:36.210> view

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this will take me to the loop view

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
this will take me to the loop view
clicking<00:01:37.229> XY<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> take<00:01:37.979> me<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
clicking XY it's going to take me to

will do a flag system because that'll be
really<00:02:17.140> simple<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:18.190> select<00:02:18.520> flag<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.120> then

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
images to mark them all as rejected so

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.440 
images to mark them all as rejected so
we're<00:02:38.590> essentially<00:02:39.220> painting<00:02:39.819> these

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
we're essentially painting these

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.240 
we're essentially painting these
different<00:02:40.989> metadata<00:02:41.380> settings<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.160> our

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
different metadata settings on to our

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.970 
different metadata settings on to our
images<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.720> want<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.110> mark<00:02:44.500> them<00:02:44.680> all<00:02:44.860> as

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
images if I want to mark them all as

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.590 
images if I want to mark them all as
unflagged<00:02:45.430> again<00:02:45.700> well<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.030> go<00:02:46.239> down<00:02:46.269> to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
unflagged again well I just go down to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.410 
unflagged again well I just go down to
my<00:02:46.720> options<00:02:47.130> switch<00:02:48.130> rejected<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.880> unflagged

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
my options switch rejected to unflagged

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
my options switch rejected to unflagged
and<00:02:49.720> then<00:02:50.410> we<00:02:50.500> go<00:02:50.620> back<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:50.950> we<00:02:51.010> paint<00:02:51.280> over

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
and then we go back and we paint over

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.960 
and then we go back and we paint over
all<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.819> them<00:02:51.940> again<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.580> quick<00:02:54.790> way<00:02:54.850> of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
all of them again so it's a quick way of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.460 
all of them again so it's a quick way of
applying<00:02:55.269> these<00:02:55.540> different<00:02:55.810> settings<00:02:56.049> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
applying these different settings to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.890 
applying these different settings to
your<00:02:57.160> images<00:02:57.519> what<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.330> just<00:02:58.480> did<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.840> a

your images what we just did was a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.990 
your images what we just did was a
metadata<00:02:59.380> or<00:02:59.620> an<00:02:59.709> attribute<00:02:59.860> setting<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:00.970> we

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
metadata or an attribute setting but we

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.150 
metadata or an attribute setting but we
can<00:03:01.150> also<00:03:01.269> apply<00:03:01.480> fixes<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.739> let<00:03:02.890> me<00:03:02.950> show<00:03:03.069> you

left<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:22.660> we'll<00:03:23.230> say<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.769> how<00:03:23.799> they

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
left and we'll say that this is how they

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.520 
left and we'll say that this is how they
came<00:03:24.190> into<00:03:24.430> Lightroom<00:03:24.940> what<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:25.989> can<00:03:26.109> do<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.350> go

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
came into Lightroom what we can do is go

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.170 
came into Lightroom what we can do is go

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
right bracket we can just go down to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.080

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.660 
rotation select rotate right clockwise
and<00:03:37.510> we<00:03:38.140> can<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.440> select<00:03:38.829> each<00:03:39.130> image<00:03:39.340> and

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
and we can just select each image and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.330 
and we can just select each image and
rotate<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.450> we<00:03:41.290> have<00:03:41.440> over<00:03:41.769> images<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.250> are

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
rotate it we have over images that are

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
rotate it we have over images that are
closely<00:03:42.579> grouped<00:03:43.329> together<00:03:43.540> like<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:43.989> we

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
closely grouped together like this we

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.690 
closely grouped together like this we
can<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:44.470> drag<00:03:44.680> over<00:03:44.950> each<00:03:45.100> one<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.579> it'll

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
can just drag over each one and it'll

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.400 
can just drag over each one and it'll
rotate<00:03:45.850> each<00:03:46.150> one<00:03:46.329> of<00:03:46.420> them<00:03:46.540> back<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.079> normal

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
rotate each one of them back to normal

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.920 
rotate each one of them back to normal
again<00:03:48.220> one<00:03:48.730> last<00:03:48.760> one<00:03:49.180> right<00:03:49.329> here<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.750> we're

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
again one last one right here and we're

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.809 
again one last one right here and we're
done<00:03:50.139> so<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.920> much<00:03:51.100> easier<00:03:51.400> than<00:03:51.489> having<00:03:51.549> to

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
done so it's much easier than having to

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.550 
done so it's much easier than having to
find<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.450> select<00:03:52.690> all<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.989> images<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.319> then

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
find and select all the images and then

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.580 
find and select all the images and then
apply<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.630> shortcut<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.049> rotate<00:03:56.470> them

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
apply a shortcut to it to rotate them

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.620 
apply a shortcut to it to rotate them
all<00:03:56.739> or<00:03:56.950> just<00:03:57.160> do<00:03:57.250> them<00:03:57.370> individually<00:03:57.600> we<00:03:58.600> can

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
all or just do them individually we can

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.539 
all or just do them individually we can
do<00:03:58.870> these<00:03:59.019> kind<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.290> small<00:03:59.859> little<00:04:00.130> fixes

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
do these kind of small little fixes

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.879 
do these kind of small little fixes
quickly<00:04:01.060> over<00:04:01.359> a<00:04:01.389> big<00:04:01.660> group<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.930> photos<00:04:02.260> with

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
quickly over a big group of photos with

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.590 
quickly over a big group of photos with
the<00:04:03.190> painter<00:04:03.489> tool<00:04:03.700> all<00:04:04.120> right<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.420> let's

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
the painter tool all right so let's

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.120 
the painter tool all right so let's
place<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> painter<00:04:05.260> tool<00:04:05.380> back<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.889> let's<00:04:06.010> go

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
place the painter tool back and let's go

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.590 
place the painter tool back and let's go
on<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> next<00:04:06.549> option<00:04:06.819> we<00:04:07.090> have<00:04:07.269> which<00:04:07.569> is

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
on to the next option we have which is

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.960 
on to the next option we have which is
the<00:04:07.930> sort<00:04:08.319> direction<00:04:08.799> now<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.609> sort

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
the sort direction now the sort

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.220 
the sort direction now the sort
direction<00:04:10.299> is<00:04:10.389> basically<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:10.780> gonna<00:04:10.900> change

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
direction is basically just gonna change

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.559 
direction is basically just gonna change
how<00:04:11.620> these<00:04:11.859> images<00:04:12.220> are<00:04:12.370> sorted<00:04:12.790> currently

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
how these images are sorted currently

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.720 
how these images are sorted currently
it's<00:04:13.720> based<00:04:13.959> on<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.380> user<00:04:14.620> order<00:04:15.010> but<00:04:15.549> we<00:04:15.609> can

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
it's based on a user order but we can

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.099 
it's based on a user order but we can
change<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.120> based<00:04:16.329> on<00:04:16.419> whatever<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.810> want

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
change this based on whatever we want

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.599 
change this based on whatever we want
so<00:04:17.260> whether<00:04:17.410> we<00:04:17.530> want<00:04:17.650> capture<00:04:18.070> time<00:04:18.250> or<00:04:18.549> a

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
so whether we want capture time or a

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.580 
so whether we want capture time or a
file<00:04:18.970> name<00:04:19.239> or<00:04:19.450> however<00:04:19.840> sorting<00:04:20.380> order<00:04:20.500> we

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
file name or however sorting order we

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.500 
file name or however sorting order we
want<00:04:20.709> with<00:04:20.919> its<00:04:21.070> rating<00:04:21.430> we<00:04:22.090> choose<00:04:22.330> right

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
want with its rating we choose right

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.820 
want with its rating we choose right
here<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:22.900> I'm<00:04:22.960> going<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.140> say<00:04:23.260> capture<00:04:23.680> time

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
here so I'm going to say capture time

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.850 
here so I'm going to say capture time
and<00:04:24.690> then<00:04:25.690> we<00:04:25.780> just<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.320> Z<00:04:26.560> or

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
and then we just like a to Z or

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.589 
and then we just like a to Z or
a<00:04:26.889> so<00:04:27.250> it's<00:04:27.580> either<00:04:27.669> backwards<00:04:28.120> or<00:04:28.240> forwards

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
a so it's either backwards or forwards

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.540 
a so it's either backwards or forwards
so<00:04:29.139> right<00:04:29.319> now<00:04:29.439> it<00:04:29.590> defaults<00:04:29.979> going<00:04:30.189> forward

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
so right now it defaults going forward

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.550 
so right now it defaults going forward
so<00:04:30.819> for<00:04:31.330> capture<00:04:31.659> time<00:04:31.810> it's<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.229> earliest

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
so for capture time it's the earliest

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.830 
so for capture time it's the earliest
stuff<00:04:32.800> first<00:04:33.069> latest<00:04:33.610> stuff<00:04:33.789> last<00:04:34.090> if<00:04:34.389> we

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
stuff first latest stuff last if we

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.619 
stuff first latest stuff last if we
reverse<00:04:35.139> it<00:04:35.379> then<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> switches<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.159> up<00:04:36.479> we<00:04:37.479> can

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
reverse it then it switches it up we can

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.649 
reverse it then it switches it up we can
also<00:04:37.780> do<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.139> via<00:04:38.349> rating<00:04:38.710> systems<00:04:39.069> and<00:04:39.659> select

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
also do it via rating systems and select

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.209 
also do it via rating systems and select
from<00:04:40.810> A<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:40.990> Z<00:04:41.139> we<00:04:41.560> haven't<00:04:41.860> applied<00:04:41.979> any

from A to Z we haven't applied any

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.570 
star 2 star 3 star 4 star it would sort
these<00:04:46.689> all<00:04:46.930> based<00:04:47.259> on<00:04:47.379> that<00:04:47.469> rating<00:04:47.770> system<00:04:48.129> so

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
here we can also quickly apply these

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.570 
here we can also quickly apply these
different<00:05:25.840> settings<00:05:26.469> to<00:05:26.770> our<00:05:26.860> images<00:05:27.189> so<00:05:27.400> if<00:05:27.490> I

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
different settings to our images so if I

have a you know these images selected

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.980 
have a you know these images selected
and<00:05:30.039> I<00:05:30.069> forgot<00:05:30.400> what<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.729> shortcut<00:05:31.629> is<00:05:31.750> to

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
and I forgot what the shortcut is to

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.269 
and I forgot what the shortcut is to
flag<00:05:32.289> them<00:05:32.469> well<00:05:32.650> I<00:05:32.680> can<00:05:32.800> just<00:05:32.830> go<00:05:33.009> down<00:05:33.099> to<00:05:33.190> my

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
flag them well I can just go down to my

flag them well I can just go down to my
toolbar<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:33.879> now<00:05:34.029> that<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.330> flagging<00:05:34.810> option

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.320 
toolbar and now that the flagging option
is<00:05:35.169> available<00:05:35.289> I<00:05:35.800> can<00:05:36.279> hit<00:05:36.460> flag<00:05:36.699> as<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.879> pic<00:05:37.120> or

I can unflagging it again or I can hit
reject<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:41.919> it's<00:05:42.009> another<00:05:42.219> way<00:05:42.400> of<00:05:42.430> quickly

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
reject so it's another way of quickly

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.430 
reject so it's another way of quickly
adding<00:05:43.389> these<00:05:43.479> different<00:05:43.539> attributes<00:05:44.259> to<00:05:44.349> our

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
adding these different attributes to our

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.159 
adding these different attributes to our
images<00:05:44.770> we<00:05:45.370> also<00:05:45.580> have<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.270> purple<00:05:46.690> option

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
images we also have the purple option

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.990 
images we also have the purple option
from<00:05:47.289> here<00:05:47.379> which<00:05:47.830> we<00:05:47.979> didn't<00:05:48.339> have<00:05:48.580> with<00:05:48.879> our

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
from here which we didn't have with our

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.059 
from here which we didn't have with our
numbers<00:05:49.360> if<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:49.990> guys<00:05:50.080> remember<00:05:50.349> the<00:05:50.740> the

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
numbers if you guys remember the the

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.129 
numbers if you guys remember the the
highest<00:05:51.250> shortcut<00:05:51.789> for<00:05:52.089> color<00:05:52.599> labels<00:05:52.990> was

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
highest shortcut for color labels was

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.589 
highest shortcut for color labels was
nine<00:05:53.469> which<00:05:54.129> set<00:05:54.339> it<00:05:54.460> to<00:05:54.520> blue<00:05:54.759> so<00:05:55.360> this<00:05:55.479> is

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
nine which set it to blue so this is

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.050 
nine which set it to blue so this is
another<00:05:55.779> way<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:55.990> applying<00:05:56.520> purple<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.639> images

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
another way of applying purple to images

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.839 
another way of applying purple to images
where<00:05:58.479> you<00:05:58.900> know<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.050> previously<00:05:59.469> couldn't

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
where you know you previously couldn't

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.519 
where you know you previously couldn't
alright<00:06:00.849> so<00:06:00.969> we<00:06:01.089> also<00:06:01.270> added<00:06:01.719> the<00:06:01.839> rotation

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
alright so we also added the rotation

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.320 
alright so we also added the rotation
options<00:06:02.949> so<00:06:03.189> we<00:06:03.219> can<00:06:03.400> actually<00:06:03.669> rotate<00:06:03.819> photos

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
options so we can actually rotate photos

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.499 
options so we can actually rotate photos
left<00:06:04.750> or<00:06:05.020> right<00:06:05.500> based<00:06:05.919> on<00:06:06.009> the<00:06:06.129> groupings<00:06:06.520> we

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
left or right based on the groupings we

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.540 
left or right based on the groupings we
can<00:06:07.659> also<00:06:07.810> go<00:06:08.139> to<00:06:08.169> a<00:06:08.469> previous<00:06:08.860> photo<00:06:09.069> or<00:06:09.339> to<00:06:09.520> a

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
can also go to a previous photo or to a

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.670 
can also go to a previous photo or to a
next<00:06:10.089> photo<00:06:10.270> again<00:06:10.659> it's<00:06:11.080> probably<00:06:11.199> easier<00:06:11.620> to

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
next photo again it's probably easier to

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.079 
next photo again it's probably easier to
use<00:06:11.889> just<00:06:12.039> the<00:06:12.159> left<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:12.550> right<00:06:12.669> arrows<00:06:12.939> on

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
use just the left and right arrows on

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.969 
use just the left and right arrows on
your<00:06:13.120> keyboard<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:14.110> go<00:06:14.229> from<00:06:14.439> previous<00:06:14.830> to

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
your keyboard to go from previous to

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.279 
your keyboard to go from previous to
last<00:06:15.219> but<00:06:15.969> you<00:06:16.150> do<00:06:16.300> have<00:06:16.449> that<00:06:16.509> option<00:06:16.689> here<00:06:17.110> so

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
last but you do have that option here so

flagging<00:06:34.479> and<00:06:34.689> rating<00:06:35.139> and<00:06:35.319> then<00:06:35.770> I<00:06:35.800> remove

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
flagging and rating and then I remove

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.939 
flagging and rating and then I remove
color<00:06:36.490> labels<00:06:37.349> actually<00:06:38.349> will<00:06:38.620> keep<00:06:38.770> color

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
color labels actually will keep color

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:39.900 
color labels actually will keep color
labels<00:06:39.279> but<00:06:39.520> I<00:06:39.580> remove

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
the rotate navigate slideshow and the

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.400 
the rotate navigate slideshow and the
thumbnail<00:06:46.090> size<00:06:46.270> I'm<00:06:46.570> always<00:06:46.750> using<00:06:47.080> plus<00:06:47.290> or

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
thumbnail size I'm always using plus or

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.570 
thumbnail size I'm always using plus or
minus<00:06:47.650> anyway<00:06:47.950> so<00:06:48.010> I<00:06:48.100> don't<00:06:48.280> really<00:06:48.340> need<00:06:48.520> that

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
minus anyway so I don't really need that

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.210 
minus anyway so I don't really need that
either<00:06:48.880> so<00:06:49.780> it's<00:06:49.990> nice<00:06:50.200> because<00:06:50.230> when<00:06:50.680> I<00:06:50.710> look

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
either so it's nice because when I look

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.740 
either so it's nice because when I look
at<00:06:51.340> my<00:06:51.430> images<00:06:51.820> and<00:06:52.000> I'm<00:06:52.060> actually<00:06:52.240> rating

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
at my images and I'm actually rating

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.780 
at my images and I'm actually rating
even<00:06:52.930> if<00:06:53.140> I'm<00:06:53.230> using<00:06:53.440> the<00:06:53.620> shortcuts<00:06:54.100> even<00:06:54.730> if

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
even if I'm using the shortcuts even if

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.120 
even if I'm using the shortcuts even if
I'm<00:06:54.910> selecting<00:06:55.300> P<00:06:55.540> on<00:06:55.660> an<00:06:55.780> image<00:06:56.080> it's<00:06:56.710> nice<00:06:56.980> to

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
I'm selecting P on an image it's nice to

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.500 
I'm selecting P on an image it's nice to
have<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.340> toolbar<00:06:57.670> present<00:06:58.060> because<00:06:58.270> I<00:06:58.360> can

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
have the toolbar present because I can

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.750 
have the toolbar present because I can
see<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:58.990> that<00:06:59.310> keystroke<00:07:00.310> was<00:07:00.460> actually

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
see that that keystroke was actually

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.010 
see that that keystroke was actually
registered<00:07:01.180> and<00:07:01.330> I<00:07:01.360> can<00:07:01.510> see<00:07:01.630> that<00:07:01.750> the<00:07:01.840> image

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
registered and I can see that the image

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.290 
registered and I can see that the image
was<00:07:02.110> flagged<00:07:02.440> just<00:07:03.190> by<00:07:03.310> selecting<00:07:04.120> an<00:07:04.240> image

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
was flagged just by selecting an image

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.870 
was flagged just by selecting an image
so<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.080> know<00:07:05.200> quickly<00:07:05.650> if<00:07:05.830> an<00:07:05.980> image<00:07:06.220> is<00:07:06.310> rated

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
so I know quickly if an image is rated

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.310 
so I know quickly if an image is rated
or<00:07:07.060> if<00:07:07.120> it<00:07:07.210> has<00:07:07.360> a<00:07:07.390> color<00:07:07.690> it<00:07:07.810> will<00:07:07.900> apply<00:07:08.050> just

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
or if it has a color it will apply just

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.810 
or if it has a color it will apply just
by<00:07:08.410> looking<00:07:08.710> down<00:07:08.830> in<00:07:09.010> the<00:07:09.070> toolbar<00:07:09.460> as<00:07:09.610> it'll

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
by looking down in the toolbar as it'll

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.300 
by looking down in the toolbar as it'll
show<00:07:10.030> each<00:07:10.300> one<00:07:10.510> of<00:07:10.630> these<00:07:10.780> items<00:07:11.710> that<00:07:11.980> I<00:07:12.070> each

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
show each one of these items that I each

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.410 
show each one of these items that I each
one<00:07:12.430> of<00:07:12.490> these<00:07:12.550> attributes<00:07:13.000> that<00:07:13.060> I<00:07:13.150> apply<00:07:13.360> to

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 
one of these attributes that I apply to

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.480 
one of these attributes that I apply to
these<00:07:13.630> images<00:07:13.900> you<00:07:14.230> can<00:07:14.860> also<00:07:14.980> see<00:07:15.190> it<00:07:15.280> down<00:07:15.370> on

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
these images you can also see it down on

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.980 
these images you can also see it down on
the<00:07:15.550> filmstrip<00:07:15.970> but<00:07:16.150> they<00:07:16.240> are<00:07:16.390> rather<00:07:16.630> small

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
the filmstrip but they are rather small

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.570 
the filmstrip but they are rather small
so<00:07:17.440> it's<00:07:17.710> kind<00:07:17.890> of<00:07:17.920> nice<00:07:18.040> to<00:07:18.220> be<00:07:18.250> able<00:07:18.310> to<00:07:18.430> see

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
so it's kind of nice to be able to see

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.340 
so it's kind of nice to be able to see
it<00:07:18.670> a<00:07:18.730> little<00:07:18.820> bit<00:07:19.000> larger<00:07:19.150> so<00:07:19.510> again<00:07:19.810> hit<00:07:20.020> T<00:07:20.230> to
