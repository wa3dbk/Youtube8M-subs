00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.319
 jukebox finally opened went well now 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.540
 back from the hospital can yes 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.120
 Look in the boxes so they can 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.720
 more holidays so more holidays in july 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.539
 Holidays for the beautiful at the bux bux 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 is the feeling of christmas 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.439
 ok i do not want to christmas now 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.859
 Think if we have summer 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.859
 ok no matter the magazine tastes italy 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.899
 there are certainly recipes in it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:49.760
 We find american barbecue flavor 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.399
 out 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:59.570
 extra kwan jin well so slow are one 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.570
 a bit many chips always there but 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:09.960
 side is that all manami hazelnut 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.409
 that looks delicious that looks like 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.549
 something I quite like anyway 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.509
 I like hazelnut weeks 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.439
 not sinned for a long time 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.060
 I think I'm allowed to do that again 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.390
 what is the herberner special special? 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 here cocktail to the classic liqueur 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 careful that is now in the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.040
 Lactation not so practically protected 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.990
 I do not really want babies right now 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.990
 I have to confess at home 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.720
 timeout election drinks yes relaxing 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.360
 relaxing is so good for a long time 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.159
 durable and is certainly alcohol free me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 have a look 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 yes that does not look like alcohol very much 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.790
 nice that, however , I can then 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.790
 I think I'm fine 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.230
 is here somewhere and elaborate books 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.450
 it almost looks like it's just about 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.010
 drinks go 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.170
 I need my second hand now 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.360
 I have the things ever 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.040
 taken out of the packaging and 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 Here I have to give up because this 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.010
 FaÃŸbrause mango on which I'm genuine 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.690
 that would have been great, unfortunately 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.690
 leaked out and stuck it that way 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.820
 is not really getting out of here 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.580
 the packaging I have to then probably 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.890
 complain 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.200
 Of course that is not so nice 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.470
 I really would have a pity mango 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.790
 like to try so i say that now too 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.590
 stand there in there 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.810
 not that this is my bed 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.120
 yes the box seems really one 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.190
 softbox to be somehow a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 mainly drinks here we have 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:02.790
 with sky there is actually alcohol in it 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.410
 I take it because it contains 66 yes 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.989
 wine-based drinks 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.660
 yes there is wine in there and have here 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.530
 that's what we're wondering 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.250
 then time must be left and 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.160
 I hope poverty still speaks like the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.950
 here are the currant 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.830
 refreshing drink from the extracts 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.470
 that is once anti-alcoholic that allowed 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.450
 I drink again then the box is 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.920
 really very drinky have the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 barrel shower we have these three 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.180
 phial 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.540
 we have timeout we have this 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.540
 cocktail 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.450
 that's just six drinks and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.390
 nibble two weapons 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.070
 I do not know is kinda one 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:00.480
 bit one-sided the box I have to 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:02.310
 So confess somehow I do not know 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.600
 how do you like the box write? 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.130
 please in the comments 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.930
 I'm a little torn apart 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.850
 I also like new drinks 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.580
 try 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.560
 but that is already very much 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.650
 Alcohol loads here and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.919
 yes somehow me a little bit too 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.609
 one-sidedly frankly something was noticeable 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.880
 a hit 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.139
 Well then write me as I said in the 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.150
 comments like her the box I find 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.590
 I'm torn as I said 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.960
 not quite as enthusiastic about it now 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.080
 month from this box but the next one 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.850
 is already at the door and I would 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.930
 say 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.830
 let's hope the next and we 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.830
 see us in the next video
