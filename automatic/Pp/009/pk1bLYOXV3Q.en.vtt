00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.190
 a point 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.190
 a point 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.869
 30 per cent 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:14.989
 a point 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.989
 photo ap 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.620
 now 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.520
 now 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.670

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.350
 Each year more than 15 thousand accidents with victims in the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.940
 that freight or passenger transport vehicles are involved 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.160
 taking into account that 90% of the information we need to 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 driving is visual 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.740
 we find that this situation is more common than it seems 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.890
 so that those large vehicles would be better the regulation of vehicles 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.560
 engine incorporates a new contour marking reflective signal 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 called v 23 ' 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.530
 This device allows to perceive in low visibility conditions the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 Perimeter of the rear and side of vehicles 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.720
 according to a study carried out by the transportation department of the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.050
 united states the contour marking of the heaviest vehicles 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.340
 would reduce by almost 30% the accidents in which they are involved 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.660
 These are especially bulky vehicles that occupy a large space 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.360
 in the village and this makes it difficult for another driver who has not perceived them to 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 time can be diverted wafer evasive maneuvers 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.880
 therefore for the registrations made since July 10, 2011 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.110
 vehicles intended for the carriage of goods whose maximum weight 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.140
 authorized exceeds seven and a half tons 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.010
 having a length greater than 6 meters and with a greater width or 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.710
 equal to 2 comma one meters are required to place these bands 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.840
 reflective 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380
 they also have to do the trailers and semitrailers with a weight 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.869
 maximum of more than three and a half tons 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:19.359
 the new regulation allows other vehicles not obliged to place this 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.039
 reflective device 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.149
 therefore if you drive a vehicle with these characteristics registered before 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:29.159
 of July 10, 2011 your collaboration is important 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.379
 Mark your contour with the signal v 23 'so you will make it easier for others 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.430
 visualize coast that the size of helps reduce accidents 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.379
 It is also recommended that you install it if you are a coach driver van or 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.969
 of other goods or passenger transport vehicles 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.120
 because you spend many hours on the road and you know what to do homework 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.119
 important for everyone's safety 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:12.019
 it is not a decorative element is to say that we are not talking about tuning 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.559
 but security 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.759
 and therefore the law prohibits the use of the signal to passenger cars of 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.899
 passenger transport of less than eight seats and single-digit trailers 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:27.930
 the contour marking is done with an easy reflective adhesive tape 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.109
 installation 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.819
 in any case it must be a device as achieved and its color 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.359
 It may vary depending on the part to be signaled so for the rear part it 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.909
 will use the color yellow as red while for the sides 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.909
 the colors yellow will be valid 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.059
 if all signs are reflective if cyclists are obliged to 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.010
 circular with vest and reflective badges if the bridges and tunnels 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.010
 they are marked with elements that help their visualization 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.509
 it makes sense that especially bulky vehicles 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.509
 this marked in its entirety 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.390
 your collaboration 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.849
 It is important 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.179
 safer you more sure all is an initiative of the national committee of 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.430
 road transport with the collaboration of the general management 

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:19.130
 ground transportation 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.740
 and the general direction of traffic to improve road safety
