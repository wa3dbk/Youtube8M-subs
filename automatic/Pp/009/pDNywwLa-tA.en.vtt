okay<00:00:08.920> my<00:00:09.100> name<00:00:09.220> is<00:00:09.340> Tom<00:00:09.520> Peterson<00:00:09.910> and<00:00:10.300> I'm

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
okay my name is Tom Peterson and I'm

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.959 
okay my name is Tom Peterson and I'm
with<00:00:10.720> nvidia<00:00:11.170> and<00:00:11.580> what<00:00:12.580> I'm<00:00:12.670> showing<00:00:12.700> you

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
with nvidia and what I'm showing you

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.930 
with nvidia and what I'm showing you
here<00:00:13.059> is<00:00:13.330> 4k<00:00:13.960> with<00:00:14.650> GC<00:00:15.070> now<00:00:15.550> this<00:00:15.730> is<00:00:15.910> a

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
here is 4k with GC now this is a

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.609 
here is 4k with GC now this is a
prototype<00:00:16.390> monitor<00:00:17.050> that<00:00:17.230> we<00:00:17.320> built<00:00:17.529> together

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
prototype monitor that we built together

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.830 
prototype monitor that we built together
just<00:00:18.130> to<00:00:18.220> demonstrate<00:00:18.490> a<00:00:19.119> proof<00:00:19.510> of<00:00:19.660> concept

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
just to demonstrate a proof of concept

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.160 
just to demonstrate a proof of concept
here<00:00:20.260> at<00:00:20.380> CES<00:00:20.590> it's<00:00:21.460> using<00:00:21.849> anasuya<00:00:22.540> came<00:00:23.020> on

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
here at CES it's using anasuya came on

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.220 
here at CES it's using anasuya came on
eter<00:00:23.349> but<00:00:23.890> if<00:00:24.010> you<00:00:24.099> look<00:00:24.250> on<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.550> back<00:00:24.730> here

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
eter but if you look on the back here

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.470 
eter but if you look on the back here
let<00:00:26.230> me<00:00:26.290> see<00:00:26.320> if<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.560> can<00:00:26.710> show<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.070> all<00:00:27.939> of<00:00:28.000> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
let me see if I can show you all of the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.659 
let me see if I can show you all of the
guts<00:00:29.259> of<00:00:29.439> this<00:00:29.590> monitor<00:00:30.099> have<00:00:30.310> been<00:00:30.489> removed

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
guts of this monitor have been removed

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.600 
guts of this monitor have been removed
and<00:00:31.270> we've<00:00:31.840> replaced<00:00:32.290> it<00:00:32.560> with<00:00:32.770> a<00:00:33.100> g-sync

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
and we've replaced it with a g-sync

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.069 
and we've replaced it with a g-sync
module<00:00:34.120> so<00:00:34.660> one<00:00:35.020> module<00:00:35.260> enables<00:00:36.420> 4k<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.690> 60

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
module so one module enables 4k and 60

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.440 
module so one module enables 4k and 60
Hertz<00:00:38.290> now<00:00:39.130> what<00:00:39.340> we're<00:00:39.489> showing<00:00:39.700> next<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.300> it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
Hertz now what we're showing next to it

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.860 
Hertz now what we're showing next to it
is<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:41.500> original<00:00:42.160> panel<00:00:42.610> so<00:00:43.000> here's<00:00:43.660> the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
is the original panel so here's the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.840 
is the original panel so here's the
original<00:00:43.960> design<00:00:44.650> which<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.220> sous<00:00:45.460> panel

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
original design which is in a sous panel

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.630 
original design which is in a sous panel
and<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> modified<00:00:47.290> video<00:00:47.770> cam

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
and this is the modified video cam

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.200 
and this is the modified video cam
so<00:00:50.270> what<00:00:50.450> you'll<00:00:50.630> see<00:00:50.870> on<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.320> left-hand<00:00:51.680> side

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
so what you'll see on the left-hand side

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.479 
so what you'll see on the left-hand side
is<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.600> way<00:00:53.750> monitors<00:00:54.710> work<00:00:54.920> today<00:00:55.220> it's

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
is the way monitors work today it's

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.180 
is the way monitors work today it's
running<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.940> fixed<00:00:56.360> refresh<00:00:56.780> rate<00:00:57.050> at<00:00:57.379> 60<00:00:57.980> Hertz

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
running a fixed refresh rate at 60 Hertz

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.160 
running a fixed refresh rate at 60 Hertz
and<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.850> can<00:00:59.000> see<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.360> little<00:00:59.570> flickering

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
and you can see this little flickering

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.100 
and you can see this little flickering
it's<00:01:00.680> because<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.190> frame<00:01:01.430> rate<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.850> at<00:01:02.149> 40<00:01:02.540> so

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
it's because the frame rate is at 40 so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.630 
it's because the frame rate is at 40 so
when<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.379> frame<00:01:03.590> rates<00:01:03.800> not<00:01:04.010> matching<00:01:04.460> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
when the frame rates not matching the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.580 
when the frame rates not matching the
refresh<00:01:05.180> rate<00:01:05.300> you<00:01:05.630> have<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.930> do<00:01:06.080> something<00:01:06.320> to

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
refresh rate you have to do something to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.740 
refresh rate you have to do something to
get<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.890> on<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.490> screen<00:01:07.759> in<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.000> case<00:01:08.210> we're

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
get it on the screen in this case we're

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.630 
get it on the screen in this case we're
turning<00:01:09.170> be<00:01:09.350> synced<00:01:09.680> up<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.220> we're<00:01:10.520> doing

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
turning be synced up and we're doing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.310 
turning be synced up and we're doing
what's<00:01:10.910> called<00:01:11.060> tearing<00:01:11.600> just<00:01:11.900> great

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
what's called tearing just great

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.620 
what's called tearing just great
matching<00:01:12.800> but<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.430> doesn't<00:01:13.700> look<00:01:13.759> great<00:01:14.060> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
matching but it doesn't look great the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.410 
matching but it doesn't look great the
other<00:01:14.780> option<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.619> turn<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:16.070> sink<00:01:16.340> on<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:17.330> I

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
other option is to turn a sink on and I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.969 
other option is to turn a sink on and I
can<00:01:17.570> do<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:17.900> my<00:01:18.020> little<00:01:18.259> app<00:01:18.380> now<00:01:18.830> with

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
can do that in my little app now with

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.270 
can do that in my little app now with
these<00:01:19.130> things<00:01:19.430> on<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.300> can<00:01:20.479> see<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.280> pendulum

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
these things on you can see the pendulum

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.980 
these things on you can see the pendulum
is<00:01:22.399> kind<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.789> pulsing<00:01:23.330> as<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.630> moves<00:01:23.810> from<00:01:23.899> left

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
is kind of pulsing as it moves from left

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.680 
is kind of pulsing as it moves from left
to<00:01:24.649> right<00:01:24.740> that's<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.520> same<00:01:25.759> problem<00:01:26.180> we're

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
to right that's the same problem we're

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.920 
to right that's the same problem we're
synchronizing<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.770> 40<00:01:28.490> Hertz

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
synchronizing a 40 Hertz

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
refresh right and occasionally we're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.530 
refresh right and occasionally we're
replaying<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> front

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
replaying the front

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
replaying the front
what<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.230> think<00:01:37.500> turns<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.040> side

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
what you think turns on this side

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
what you think turns on this side
because<00:01:38.730> it<00:01:39.000> changes<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> equation

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
because it changes that equation

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.500 
because it changes that equation
entirely<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:40.980> instead<00:01:41.730> of<00:01:41.790> updating<00:01:42.420> at

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
entirely and now instead of updating at

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.870 
entirely and now instead of updating at
a<00:01:42.570> fixed<00:01:42.810> refresh<00:01:43.320> rate<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.070> variable<00:01:44.640> rate

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
a fixed refresh rate the variable rate

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
a fixed refresh rate the variable rate
of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> monitor<00:01:45.900> matches<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> frame<00:01:47.010> rate<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
of the monitor matches the frame rate of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
of the monitor matches the frame rate of
the<00:01:47.670> game<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.870> case<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.380> monitor

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the game so in this case the monitor

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
the game so in this case the monitor
itself<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.490> actually<00:01:50.640> refreshing<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.840> 40

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
itself is actually refreshing at 40

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.860 
itself is actually refreshing at 40
times<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.650> second<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:54.060> allows<00:01:54.270> us<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.720> get

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
times a second that allows us to get

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.440 
times a second that allows us to get
much<00:01:55.350> much<00:01:55.380> smoother<00:01:56.100> motion<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.970> get<00:01:57.240> rid<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
much much smoother motion and get rid of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.900 
much much smoother motion and get rid of
any<00:01:57.690> artifacting<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.470> tear<00:01:58.710> English<00:01:58.979> so

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
any artifacting like tear English so

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.760 
any artifacting like tear English so
it's<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.240> very<00:02:00.300> simple<00:02:00.630> concept<00:02:00.810> there

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's a very very simple concept there

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.200 
it's a very very simple concept there
you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.250> either<00:02:02.340> more<00:02:02.580> exaggerated

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you can see it either more exaggerated

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.020 
you can see it either more exaggerated
if<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.710> orbit<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.830> camera<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.220> little<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
if I orbit the camera a little bit and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.450 
if I orbit the camera a little bit and
then<00:02:06.170> orbit<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.260> camera<00:02:07.530> over<00:02:07.740> here

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
then orbit the camera over here

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.760 
then orbit the camera over here
and<00:02:09.640> then<00:02:09.790> turn<00:02:10.120> to<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.600> no<00:02:10.750> visa<00:02:11.020> this

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
and then turn to that for no visa this

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.320 
and then turn to that for no visa this
is<00:02:11.920> much<00:02:12.100> more<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.520> experience<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.000> game<00:02:13.180> as

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
is much more the experience the game as

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.270 
is much more the experience the game as
you<00:02:13.450> used<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.720> its<00:02:13.990> kind<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.800> know<00:02:14.830> got<00:02:15.130> all

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you used to its kind of you know got all

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.800 
you used to its kind of you know got all
this<00:02:15.400> little<00:02:15.670> flickering<00:02:16.180> things<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.720> it's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
this little flickering things and it's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.960 
this little flickering things and it's
sort<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.140> posting<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.040> stuttering<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.610> this

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
sort of posting and stuttering and this

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.400 
sort of posting and stuttering and this
is<00:02:19.120> running<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.450> 40<00:02:19.720> frames<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.990> second<00:02:20.290> which

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
is running at 40 frames a second which

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.290 
is running at 40 frames a second which
most<00:02:20.620> people<00:02:20.710> think<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.190> great<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.060> over

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
most people think it's great and over

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.200 
most people think it's great and over
here<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:23.140> same<00:02:23.410> experience<00:02:24.100> 40<00:02:24.820> frames<00:02:24.970> a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
here the same experience 40 frames a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.870 
here the same experience 40 frames a
second<00:02:25.630> only<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.590> smooth<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.310> silky<00:02:27.580> and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
second only it's smooth and silky and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.410 
second only it's smooth and silky and
muttering<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.410> Jesus

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
muttering because of Jesus

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.990 
muttering because of Jesus
now<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:33.160> kind<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.459> cool<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.640> look<00:02:33.790> at<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
now it's kind of cool to look at the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.309 
now it's kind of cool to look at the
demo<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.450> maybe<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.810> would<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.930> better<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
demo but maybe it would be better to

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.260 
demo but maybe it would be better to
show<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.650> game<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.910> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> get

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
show you a game so I'm just going to get

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.000 
show you a game so I'm just going to get
out<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
out of here and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.350 
out of here and
close<00:02:39.430> crafts<00:02:40.290> I'm<00:02:41.290> going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> launch

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
close crafts I'm going to launch

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.100 
close crafts I'm going to launch
relax

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
relax

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.170 
relax
supporting<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:45.830> that's<00:02:46.400> great<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:46.940> let<00:02:47.090> me

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
supporting in it that's great so let me

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.410 
supporting in it that's great so let me
go<00:02:47.450> ahead<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.630> pull<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:47.990> perhaps<00:02:48.200> again

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
go ahead and pull up perhaps again

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.210 
go ahead and pull up perhaps again
there's<00:02:50.930> perhaps

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.230 

and<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.700> think<00:02:59.760> we<00:03:00.270> looking<00:03:00.480> here<00:03:00.510> okay

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.140 

okay<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.500> what<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.550> game<00:03:06.910> called

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
okay so what this is is a game called

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.130 
okay so what this is is a game called
anno<00:03:07.660> 2070<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.760> what<00:03:10.240> you'll<00:03:10.420> notice<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.960> I

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
anno 2070 and what you'll notice is I

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.050 
anno 2070 and what you'll notice is I
can<00:03:11.350> move<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.800> screen<00:03:12.220> around<00:03:12.490> with<00:03:12.880> my

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
can move the screen around with my

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.570 
can move the screen around with my
cursor<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:14.080> when<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:14.650> at<00:03:14.740> 60<00:03:15.190> frames<00:03:15.220> a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
cursor and when we're at 60 frames a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.810 
cursor and when we're at 60 frames a
second<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.690> behavior<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.410> great<00:03:17.770> but<00:03:18.550> what

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
second the behavior is great but what

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.300 
second the behavior is great but what
happens<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.330> when<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.570> get<00:03:19.810> into<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.590> lower<00:03:20.980> frame

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
happens is when I get into a lower frame

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.700 
happens is when I get into a lower frame
rate<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.360> starts<00:03:22.690> getting<00:03:22.840> chunky<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
rate it see it starts getting chunky and

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.620 
rate it see it starts getting chunky and
choppy<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.550> something<00:03:24.760> not<00:03:25.240> good<00:03:25.270> right

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
choppy and it's something not good right

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.950 
choppy and it's something not good right
so<00:03:26.110> smooth<00:03:26.530> if<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:26.950> just<00:03:27.160> go<00:03:27.280> left<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.660> smooth

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
so smooth if I just go left it's smooth

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.680 
so smooth if I just go left it's smooth
and<00:03:29.290> then<00:03:29.470> right<00:03:29.770> it's<00:03:30.370> chunky<00:03:30.670> but<00:03:31.390> what<00:03:31.540> you

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and then right it's chunky but what you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.570 
and then right it's chunky but what you
see<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:31.960> there's<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.560> red<00:03:32.860> box<00:03:33.130> up<00:03:33.460> here

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
see is there's a little red box up here

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.730 
see is there's a little red box up here
in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.760> corner<00:03:33.790> that's<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.930> technology<00:03:35.710> that

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
in the corner that's a technology that

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.400 
in the corner that's a technology that
we<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.160> launched<00:03:36.610> where<00:03:37.180> we're<00:03:37.930> controlling

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
we just launched where we're controlling

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.680 
we just launched where we're controlling
the<00:03:38.710> vsync<00:03:39.130> amount<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.520> this<00:03:39.670> panel<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.510> when

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the vsync amount of this panel so when

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.550 
the vsync amount of this panel so when
it's<00:03:40.810> red<00:03:41.140> vsync<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.340> on

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
it's red vsync is on

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.589 
it's red vsync is on
okay<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.950> when<00:03:44.040> these<00:03:44.220> things<00:03:44.489> on<00:03:44.700> games<00:03:45.239> have

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
okay and when these things on games have

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.780 
okay and when these things on games have
to<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.900> sunk<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> refresh<00:03:47.340> rate<00:03:47.430> they

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
to be sunk up to the refresh rate they

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.210 
to be sunk up to the refresh rate they
also<00:03:47.940> we're<00:03:48.209> at<00:03:48.300> 60<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> work<00:03:50.040> gets

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
also we're at 60 but when the work gets

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.790 
also we're at 60 but when the work gets
harder<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.300> performance<00:03:51.930> drops<00:03:52.110> down<00:03:52.349> to<00:03:52.410> 30

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
harder the performance drops down to 30

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.440 
harder the performance drops down to 30
and<00:03:53.040> then<00:03:53.099> back<00:03:53.310> up<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.640> 60<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.300> pretty

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and then back up to 60 so it's a pretty

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.470 
and then back up to 60 so it's a pretty
hard<00:03:55.349> experience<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.069> enjoy<00:03:56.370> now<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.270> i<00:03:57.330> hit

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
hard experience to enjoy now if i hit
