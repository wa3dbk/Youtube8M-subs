do<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.780> differently<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.560> if<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.280> had<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> bigger

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
do it differently and if I had a bigger

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.240 
do it differently and if I had a bigger
section<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.660> hair

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
section of hair

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.180 
section of hair
I<00:02:59.310> will<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> bigger<00:03:00.450> mess<00:03:00.840> mesh<00:03:01.590> section

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
I will have a bigger mess mesh section

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.270 
I will have a bigger mess mesh section
of<00:03:02.580> hair<00:03:02.820> but<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:04.620> I'm<00:03:04.740> working<00:03:05.100> with<00:03:05.130> here

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
of hair but what I'm working with here

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000 
of hair but what I'm working with here
is<00:03:05.640> not<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.910> big<00:03:06.300> section<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.110> didn't<00:03:07.500> it's

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
is not a big section so I didn't it's

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.400 
is not a big section so I didn't it's
not<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.460> wasn't<00:03:08.880> difficult<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.420> create<00:03:09.840> but

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
not it wasn't difficult to create but

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.920 
not it wasn't difficult to create but
this<00:03:10.620> video<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.520> recording<00:03:12.180> took<00:03:12.480> about<00:03:12.750> an

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
this video the recording took about an

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.980 
this video the recording took about an
hour<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:13.590> thirty<00:03:14.370> minutes<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> had<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
hour and thirty minutes so I had to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.770 
hour and thirty minutes so I had to
shrink<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.709> down<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.880> seven<00:03:18.420> minute

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
shrink that down to the seven minute

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.920 
shrink that down to the seven minute
point<00:03:19.290> where<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.030> that's<00:03:21.570> that's

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
point where is that now so that's that's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.920 
point where is that now so that's that's
the<00:03:22.110> reason<00:03:22.410> why<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.530> had<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.680> speed<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.160> up<00:03:23.930> but

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
the reason why I had to speed it up but

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.400 
the reason why I had to speed it up but
uh<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:26.120> later<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.330> you'll<00:03:27.600> see<00:03:27.870> me<00:03:28.050> create

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
uh and later on you'll see me create

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.430 
uh and later on you'll see me create
these<00:03:28.650> uh<00:03:29.480> strands<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.660> front<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.140> face

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
these uh strands in front of the face

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.760 
these uh strands in front of the face
and<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> way<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.220> did<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.760> was<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:33.180> changed

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
and the way I did that was I changed

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.110 
and the way I did that was I changed
added<00:03:34.770> two<00:03:34.890> strands<00:03:35.310> with<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.610> same<00:03:35.820> brush

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
added two strands with that same brush

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.210 
added two strands with that same brush
that<00:03:36.450> voodoo<00:03:36.690> brushes<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.380> had<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.900> I

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
that voodoo brushes I had and I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.050 
that voodoo brushes I had and I
increased<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.430> stroke<00:03:41.850> on<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:44.000> after<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
increased a stroke on it and after I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
increased a stroke on it and after I
increased<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.510> stroke<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.020> went<00:03:46.290> through<00:03:46.530> and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
increased the stroke I went through and

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.860 
increased the stroke I went through and
laid<00:03:47.190> down<00:03:47.520> some<00:03:48.500> some<00:03:49.670> hair<00:03:50.670> strands<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.600> top

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
laid down some some hair strands on top

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.860 
laid down some some hair strands on top
of<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.320> give<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.910> depth<00:03:53.910> or<00:03:54.270> give

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
of that to give it like a depth or give

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.840 
of that to give it like a depth or give
it<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.260> realistic<00:03:55.830> hair<00:03:56.310> feel<00:03:56.989> so<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.400> mean<00:03:59.400> like

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
it a realistic hair feel so I mean like

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.670 
it a realistic hair feel so I mean like
I<00:03:59.970> said<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.180> play<00:04:00.480> around<00:04:00.630> with<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.380> have<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
I said just play around with it I have a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.520 
I said just play around with it I have a
couple<00:04:02.250> people<00:04:02.430> write<00:04:02.820> me<00:04:02.850> already<00:04:03.510> about<00:04:04.500> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
couple people write me already about a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.080 
couple people write me already about a
couple<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:04.950> weeks<00:04:05.100> ago<00:04:05.250> asked<00:04:05.610> me<00:04:05.850> how<00:04:06.030> to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
couple of weeks ago asked me how to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.220 
couple of weeks ago asked me how to
create<00:04:06.450> hair<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.170> is

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
create hair it's up to you but this is

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.039 
create hair it's up to you but this is
just<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:11.040> guide<00:04:11.400> point<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.030> give<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.420> some

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
just a guide point to give you some

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.620 
just a guide point to give you some
insight<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.590> how<00:04:13.799> it<00:04:14.250> could<00:04:14.519> be<00:04:14.820> done<00:04:14.850> because

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
insight on how it could be done because

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.650 
insight on how it could be done because
it's<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:16.019> one<00:04:16.709> way<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.010> do<00:04:17.310> nothing<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:18.030> mean<00:04:18.390> so

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
it's not one way to do nothing I mean so

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.380 
it's not one way to do nothing I mean so
keep<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.560> mind<00:04:19.709> when<00:04:20.100> you're<00:04:20.220> working

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
keep that in mind when you're working

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.510 
keep that in mind when you're working
you<00:04:21.390> always<00:04:21.810> have<00:04:22.019> multiple<00:04:22.620> ways<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> create

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
you always have multiple ways to create

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.400 
you always have multiple ways to create
and<00:04:24.360> if<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.050> did<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.500> same<00:04:25.830> hair<00:04:26.400> section

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
and if I did the same hair section

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.690 
and if I did the same hair section
tomorrow<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.800> would<00:04:29.070> probably<00:04:29.220> do<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.610> a

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
tomorrow I would probably do it a

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.960 
tomorrow I would probably do it a
different<00:04:30.090> way<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.510> mean<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.500> would<00:04:31.680> probably

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
different way I mean I would probably

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.050 
different way I mean I would probably
take<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> gradient<00:04:33.630> mesh<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.610> just<00:04:35.610> use<00:04:35.880> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
take the gradient mesh and just use the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.870 
take the gradient mesh and just use the
gradient<00:04:36.300> mesh<00:04:36.630> by<00:04:36.930> itself<00:04:37.380> but<00:04:38.370> for<00:04:38.610> what<00:04:38.760> I'm

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
gradient mesh by itself but for what I'm

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.969 
gradient mesh by itself but for what I'm
doing<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.360> just<00:04:39.390> wanted<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.960> show<00:04:40.140> you<00:04:40.200> guys<00:04:40.590> how

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
doing I just wanted to show you guys how

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.790 
doing I just wanted to show you guys how
it<00:04:41.190> could<00:04:41.520> be<00:04:41.850> done<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.570> just<00:04:42.690> give<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.530> just

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
it could be done and just give you just

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.890 
it could be done and just give you just
idea<00:04:44.630> but<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.850> next<00:04:48.180> tutorial<00:04:48.690> I'm<00:04:48.750> going<00:04:48.840> to

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
idea but the next tutorial I'm going to

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.780 
idea but the next tutorial I'm going to
just<00:04:49.020> knock<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.440> out<00:04:49.590> I'm<00:04:49.890> gonna<00:04:50.220> work<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:50.490> our

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
just knock it out I'm gonna work on our

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.530 
just knock it out I'm gonna work on our
brows<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.419> work<00:04:51.570> on<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> ears<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:54.270> neck
