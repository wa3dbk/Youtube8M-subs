here you increase and decrease the
thrust<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:48.000> we're<00:00:48.360> using<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.780> smartphone

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
thrust and it's we're using a smartphone

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.740 
thrust and it's we're using a smartphone
to<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.010> paper<00:00:50.610> airplane<00:00:50.760> fly<00:00:51.239> easily

to make a paper airplane fly easily

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
to make a paper airplane fly easily
we're<00:00:51.960> using<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.579> computer<00:00:53.579> power<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
we're using the computer power here to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
we're using the computer power here to
calculate<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> algorithms<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:56.280> make<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
calculate all the algorithms to make it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.420 
calculate all the algorithms to make it
fly<00:00:57.210> easily<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.500> fly<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> 10<00:00:59.219> minutes
