00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.930
 hello and welcome to the second part 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.740
 my camera bag series today is 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.350
 in this bag 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.650
 that's the role of vintage paquin brown 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.070
 I have her I have the bag now 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.839
 already in use for two months 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 and yes , what else is there ash 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.740
 to be 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.829
 on Amazon where I ordered it too 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.409
 the bag costs 54 euro excluding 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.089
 delivery just as you have it from this 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.489
 everything is fast and easy 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.730
 arrived easily 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.980
 and yes, she can still say it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.899
 made of imitation leather 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.230
 according to the page noisy manufacturer page 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.359
 polyurethane 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.149
 I am not familiar with imitation leather 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.460
 but can say that I very far 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 had good experiences with that 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.059
 she smells nice on neutral 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.489
 So I would have thought that's it 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.750
 A genuine leather is quality seems 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.880
 to be good then to the extent so outside 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.950
 are 29 inches wide 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.680
 13 inches deep and 21 inches high from the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.759
 weight with them 61 grams more clearly 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 reached fascist and yes we look 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.549
 give us a closer look 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.729
 friends are two buckles to me 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.310
 small magnets work and 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.659
 works pretty well where that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 well actually I had not even 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.740
 no problems that somehow that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.469
 rise because it fails and it is 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.110
 also very pleasant and smooth 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.030
 be worthy 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.090
 here it is a main subject 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.670
 this bag and yes here it gives up 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.360
 the shoulder strap in chambers of 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.789
 unimaginable, and of course you can see the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.460
 to lose weight just like the one of the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.490
 But most bags know everything 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.229
 very noble 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.929
 So let 's just do it 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.549
 it looks like this is here again 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.720
 I once again secured the camera 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.569
 small velcro 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.349
 you can open it like it does 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.599
 Yesterday's bag is here 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.060
 a room divider in the one also 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.950
 I can take out 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.500
 most of the time on the page here mean mine 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.480
 camera including lens smaller 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.150
 objectively you can also do a second 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.190
 small lens I mostly still have 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.349
 a festbrennweite doing the me 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.959
 can put under it and on the side 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.260
 For example, you can put a lightning on it 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.010
 the most makes here are 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.099
 so small rooms 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.410
 I can not clean anything in most cases 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.109
 memory cards pure pen model release 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.920
 or whatever else you need 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:02.349
 right here again I usually take 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.540
 even extra batteries with film lightning 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.450
 not that the batteries with one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.920
 scales are empty under lock 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.730
 Tyler take cameras here then you have one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.930
 a big room here 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.000
 that was it from the bag 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.620
 but much more there is not here 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.380
 together 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:31.290
 So she sits from the side of 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:33.819
 out the back and I'll get you now 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.099
 still a few shots later 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.079
 filming the items 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.810
 to make you a better picture 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.709
 can look like the bag looks real and 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.750
 how high she is and and I will 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.720
 another short video movie with my 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.510
 camera in it or what was with me everything 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.090
 I can still fit in but overall 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.609
 say the bag is really very stylish 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.220
 especially for the price category the 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.129
 bag is also a 550 euro and power 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.709
 really something here so I already some 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.420
 compliments to pocket and get it 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.599
 I am glad 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.920
 So stay tuned because now 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.870
 comes a few more names so how 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.820
 I promise to show you here now 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.010
 which is mostly in this small 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.490
 camera bag take everything with me to 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.330
 of course, a flash of pasta 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.860
 more exactly 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.810
 as I have now divided 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.139
 then I usually take 50 times 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.730
 millimeter with my focal length though 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.910
 the most under the camera so exactly 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.590
 Stow the other way and then mine 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:46.290
 canon 60d mostly with the 24 105 standard 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.450
 to this it must be said that the 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.470
 Camera does not fit with battery grip 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.639
 that's why I have them now without 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.290
 Battery grip in it 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.389
 I also take it off most of the time 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.680
 If I know that I have this bag 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.270
 used for example tear and with 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.780
 Battery grip is camera very much anyway 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:11.060
 chunky front judge usually lures mini 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:14.220
 card doing remote control batteries still 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.789
 would like flashgun and memory cards 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.169
 Although I do the role of a protective cover 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.789
 should now stow at the end of the 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.430
 I also want to show videos like that 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:30.140
 bag looks like it when you wear it 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.270
 the bags shoulder strap so they are off 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.250
 back from very stylish I would 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.789
 say and you can do it again 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.840
 hard to jump in front of and his camera 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.840
 things out 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.310
 the touchpads are quite comfortable though 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.410
 shoulder strap could of course one 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.490
 be a bit thicker but at the 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.810
 shoulder a thicker part 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.160
 I hope the video helped you 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.160
 and see you soon
