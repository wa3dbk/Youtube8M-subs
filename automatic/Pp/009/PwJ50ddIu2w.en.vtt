we<00:02:35.609> were<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.790> thinking<00:02:36.269> trying<00:02:36.569> to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
we were just thinking trying to

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.179 
we were just thinking trying to
brainstorm<00:02:36.930> different<00:02:37.170> things<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.980> a

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
brainstorm different things what can a

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.970 
brainstorm different things what can a
digital<00:02:38.879> card<00:02:39.359> game<00:02:39.569> do<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.290> normal<00:02:40.709> cards

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
digital card game do that normal cards

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.039 
digital card game do that normal cards
can't<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.579> then<00:02:42.030> Alfie<00:02:42.359> said<00:02:42.540> well<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.959> if

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
can't and then Alfie said well what if

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.330 
can't and then Alfie said well what if
they<00:02:43.170> animated<00:02:43.620> more<00:02:43.859> like<00:02:44.010> oh<00:02:44.099> that's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
they animated more like oh that's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.069 
they animated more like oh that's
brilliant<00:02:44.519> because<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.599> know<00:02:45.719> that<00:02:45.870> makes<00:02:45.989> it

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
brilliant because you know that makes it

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.470 
brilliant because you know that makes it
so<00:02:46.200> come<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.799> much<00:02:47.099> more<00:02:47.280> alive<00:02:47.519> yeah<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.209> it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so come so much more alive yeah and it

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
so come so much more alive yeah and it
just<00:02:48.780> looks<00:02:48.989> cool<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.859> it<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.129> obvious

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
just looks cool and it was obvious

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.740 
just looks cool and it was obvious
almost<00:02:50.879> like<00:02:50.969> an<00:02:51.060> obvious<00:02:51.180> step<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.629> us<00:02:51.659> to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
almost like an obvious step for us to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.899 
almost like an obvious step for us to
take<00:02:51.900> yet<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.920> pretty<00:02:53.129> hard<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.579> us<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.700> do

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
take yet it is pretty hard for us to do

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.849 
take yet it is pretty hard for us to do
that<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.659> does<00:02:54.810> take<00:02:55.049> almost<00:02:55.200> three<00:02:55.530> times<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
that it does take almost three times the

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.649 
that it does take almost three times the
production<00:02:56.370> time<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:57.120> make<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.389> cards

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
production time to make the cards

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.120 
production time to make the cards
animated<00:02:58.079> but<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.920> worth<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.310> yeah

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.460 

when<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.910> comes<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.180> our<00:03:03.330> art<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
when it comes to our art for and the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.710 
when it comes to our art for and the
themes<00:03:04.740> for<00:03:05.310> infinity<00:03:06.030> wars<00:03:06.210> one<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.600> cool

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
themes for infinity wars one of the cool

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.180 
themes for infinity wars one of the cool
things<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.500> takes<00:03:07.650> place<00:03:07.920> across

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
things is because it takes place across

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.370 
things is because it takes place across
these<00:03:08.520> different<00:03:09.020> realities<00:03:10.020> we've<00:03:10.200> got

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
these different realities we've got

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.930 
these different realities we've got
these<00:03:10.560> different<00:03:10.950> themes<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.640> different

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
these different themes the different

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.790 
these different themes the different
feels<00:03:12.210> that<00:03:12.420> there<00:03:12.540> might<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.780> an<00:03:13.380> Eastern

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
feels that there might be an Eastern

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.340 
feels that there might be an Eastern
feel<00:03:14.100> or<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.820> steampunk<00:03:15.330> feel<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.080> that'll<00:03:16.260> be

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
feel or a steampunk feel and that'll be

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.680 
feel or a steampunk feel and that'll be
the<00:03:16.380> theme<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.040> side<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:18.030> each<00:03:18.300> side

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the theme for that side but each side

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.930 
the theme for that side but each side
will<00:03:19.050> still<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.250> say<00:03:20.430> it'll<00:03:20.670> still<00:03:20.850> be

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
will still have it say it'll still be

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.280 
will still have it say it'll still be
continuous<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.570> same<00:03:21.720> universe<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.230> you

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
can still feel the same art style

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.260 
can still feel the same art style
through<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.380> whole<00:03:25.530> thing<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.790> each<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
different that people can actually

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.700 
different that people can actually
connect<00:03:30.270> with<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> specific<00:03:31.230> theme<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.650> go

vampire deck that I've made so yeah yeah
I<00:03:37.770> think<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.280> also<00:03:38.610> one<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.910> cool<00:03:39.000> things

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
I think that also one of the cool things

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.000 
I think that also one of the cool things
because<00:03:39.630> I'm<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.260> whole<00:03:40.410> premise<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
because I'm the whole premise of the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.930 
because I'm the whole premise of the
world<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.520> there's<00:03:41.730> all<00:03:41.850> these

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
world is that there's all these

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.370 
world is that there's all these
different<00:03:42.150> parallel<00:03:42.480> dimensions<00:03:43.020> that<00:03:43.140> split

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
different parallel dimensions that split

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.320 
different parallel dimensions that split
off<00:03:43.500> from<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.770> original<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.150> can

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
off from the original and so you can

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.580 
off from the original and so you can
have<00:03:45.420> things<00:03:45.570> like<00:03:45.720> there's<00:03:46.020> one<00:03:46.170> character

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
have things like there's one character

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.620 
have things like there's one character
who's<00:03:46.770> um<00:03:47.040> she's<00:03:47.460> immortal<00:03:47.700> right<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:48.480> there's

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
who's um she's immortal right so there's

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.760 
who's um she's immortal right so there's
all<00:03:48.720> these<00:03:48.840> different<00:03:49.020> versions<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.590> her

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
all these different versions of her

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.830 
all these different versions of her
because<00:03:50.310> she<00:03:50.490> was<00:03:50.520> still<00:03:50.820> alive<00:03:50.850> when<00:03:51.150> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
because she was still alive when the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.210 
because she was still alive when the
universe<00:03:52.230> got<00:03:52.440> split<00:03:52.800> all<00:03:52.950> these<00:03:53.100> different

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
universe got split all these different

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.100 
universe got split all these different
