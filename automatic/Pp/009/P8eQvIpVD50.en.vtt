00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.830 
line right here it goes above the wing
which<00:02:06.990> makes<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.409> seem<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.849> smaller<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
which makes it seem a little smaller and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
which makes it seem a little smaller and
it<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:11.009> makes<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> model<00:02:11.610> seem

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it actually is it makes the model seem

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
it actually is it makes the model seem
smaller<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
smaller and then so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
smaller and then so
the<00:02:13.920> hair<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> actual<00:02:14.730> wing<00:02:14.970> you've<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.690> a

on<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.890> side<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.460> then<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.750> side

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
on that side and then on this side

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.260 
on that side and then on this side

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
couple of months I mean fully merged

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.010 
couple of months I mean fully merged
without<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.940> I<00:03:59.970> mean<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.450> didn't<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:00.870> want

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
without so I mean I didn't really want

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.960 
without so I mean I didn't really want
to<00:04:01.050> spend<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.320> whole<00:04:01.440> lot<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.739> money<00:04:01.860> on<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.160> so

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
to spend a whole lot of money on this so

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.240 
to spend a whole lot of money on this so
that's<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.300> story<00:04:03.510> behind<00:04:03.630> that

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
that's the story behind that

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.750 
that's the story behind that
um<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.780> another<00:04:07.170> view<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.830> think<00:04:08.489> you've

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
um so another view I think you've

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.699 
um so another view I think you've
already<00:04:08.880> showed<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.300> this<00:04:09.480> from<00:04:10.260> up<00:04:10.470> there

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
already showed you this from up there

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.400 
already showed you this from up there
down<00:04:10.980> here<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.200> then<00:04:13.200> from<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.980> side<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:16.200> is

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
down here and then from the side it is

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.890 
down here and then from the side it is
really<00:04:16.739> nice<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.250> about<00:04:17.430> 6<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.940> 1/2<00:04:18.000> no

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
really nice it's about 6 and 1/2 no

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.800 
really nice it's about 6 and 1/2 no
longer<00:04:19.590> than<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.890> it's<00:04:20.250> probably<00:04:20.549> about<00:04:20.820> 8<00:04:21.269> 8

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
longer than that it's probably about 8 8

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.450 
longer than that it's probably about 8 8
inches<00:04:22.229> long

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
inches long

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.800 
inches long

AirTrain<00:04:54.630> livery<00:04:55.729> then<00:04:56.729> I<00:04:56.759> wouldn't<00:04:57.210> buy

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
AirTrain livery then I wouldn't buy

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.379 
AirTrain livery then I wouldn't buy
because<00:04:58.229> like<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.250> said<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.789> being<00:05:00.000> merged

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
because like I said it's being merged

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.249 
because like I said it's being merged
and<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:01.320> couple<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.919> months<00:05:02.759> and<00:05:03.030> this<00:05:03.810> airline

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
and a couple of months and this airline

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.189 
and a couple of months and this airline
is<00:05:04.500> no<00:05:04.770> longer<00:05:05.009> going<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.430> be<00:05:05.580> around<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.930> if

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
is no longer going to be around so if

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.550 
is no longer going to be around so if
you<00:05:07.320> have<00:05:08.539> $70<00:05:09.539> around<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.199> you'd<00:05:10.349> rather

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
you have $70 around and you'd rather

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.850 
you have $70 around and you'd rather
spend<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.699> on<00:05:11.880> an<00:05:12.150> air<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.630> Gemini<00:05:13.169> 200<00:05:13.650> I

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
spend it on an air on a Gemini 200 I

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.400 
spend it on an air on a Gemini 200 I
would<00:05:14.669> not<00:05:14.820> spend<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.330> this<00:05:15.509> I<00:05:15.810> would

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
would not spend it on this I would

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.620 
would not spend it on this I would
consider<00:05:16.830> maybe<00:05:17.070> buying<00:05:17.340> home<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.970> this<00:05:18.419> if

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
consider maybe buying home of this if

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.990 
consider maybe buying home of this if
you're<00:05:18.780> not<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:18.900> very<00:05:19.199> serious<00:05:19.500> collector<00:05:20.099> but

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
you're not a very serious collector but

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.089 
you're not a very serious collector but
yet<00:05:21.150> again<00:05:21.389> I<00:05:21.419> want<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.870> make<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.500> channel<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
yet again I want to make the channel the

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.480 
yet again I want to make the channel the
best<00:05:23.280> as<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:23.580> can<00:05:24.259> so<00:05:25.259> that's<00:05:25.500> basically<00:05:25.949> it<00:05:26.070> for

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
best as I can so that's basically it for

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.480 
best as I can so that's basically it for
the<00:05:26.580> model<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.180> very<00:05:27.690> nice<00:05:28.099> so<00:05:29.099> once<00:05:29.370> again

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
the model it is very nice so once again

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.520 
the model it is very nice so once again
I<00:05:29.639> probably<00:05:30.000> would<00:05:30.389> not<00:05:30.539> consider<00:05:31.020> buying<00:05:31.289> it

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
I probably would not consider buying it

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.990 
I probably would not consider buying it
and<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.800> is<00:05:31.949> one<00:05:32.070> of<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.280> few<00:05:32.460> models<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:32.940> I

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
and this is one of the few models that I

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.089 
and this is one of the few models that I
wouldn't<00:05:33.270> consider<00:05:33.449> buying<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.919> that's

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
wouldn't consider buying and that's

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.879 
wouldn't consider buying and that's
controversial<00:05:35.639> it<00:05:36.419> just<00:05:36.810> uh<00:05:36.990> changes<00:05:37.710> per

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
controversial it just uh changes per

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.640 
controversial it just uh changes per
person<00:05:38.340> in<00:05:38.550> their<00:05:38.729> view<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:40.349> airline<00:05:40.620> I
