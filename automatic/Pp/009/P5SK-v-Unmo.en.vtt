and that would be a great a great way to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.860 
and that would be a great a great way to

and<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:40.470> finally<00:02:41.250> start<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.520> get<00:02:41.730> yourself

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and then finally start to get yourself

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.199 
and then finally start to get yourself
down<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.300> about<00:02:42.570> 242<00:02:43.700> that's<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.820> lot<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.000> weight

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
down to about 242 that's a lot of weight

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.050 
down to about 242 that's a lot of weight
to<00:02:45.240> lose<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.989> don't<00:02:46.440> take<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.830> lightly<00:02:47.060> it's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
to lose so don't take it lightly it's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.430 
to lose so don't take it lightly it's
going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.270> take<00:02:48.450> time<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.080> going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> take

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
going to take time it's going to take

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.250 
going to take time it's going to take
some<00:02:49.470> patience<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.900> would<00:02:52.080> say

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
some patience and I think I would say

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.630 
some patience and I think I would say
it's<00:02:52.350> going<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.590> take<00:02:52.709> about<00:02:52.830> 12<00:02:53.250> months<00:02:53.520> for

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it's going to take about 12 months for

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.280 
it's going to take about 12 months for
you<00:02:53.670> shed<00:02:53.940> all<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.239> weight<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.660> know<00:02:54.989> people

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
you shed all that weight I know people

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.470 
you shed all that weight I know people
lose<00:02:55.800> weight<00:02:55.830> faster<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.730> don't<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.300> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
lose weight faster but I don't like it I

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.180 
lose weight faster but I don't like it I
don't<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:58.080> when<00:02:58.350> people<00:02:58.620> lose<00:02:58.739> weight<00:02:58.800> too

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
don't like when people lose weight too

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.670 
don't like when people lose weight too
fast<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.590> be

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
fast because I think it's going to be

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.979 
fast because I think it's going to be
detrimental<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.400> your<00:03:02.520> strength<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.120> also

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
detrimental to your strength and also

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.270 
detrimental to your strength and also
detrimental<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.860> health<00:03:04.920> because

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
detrimental to your health because

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
detrimental to your health because
you're<00:03:05.580> going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.790> lose<00:03:05.910> muscle<00:03:06.239> mass<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
you're going to lose muscle mass and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.080 
you're going to lose muscle mass and
that's<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:08.010> want<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.220> try<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.370> avoid<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.970> at

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that's you want to try to avoid that at

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.600 
that's you want to try to avoid that at
all<00:03:09.180> costs<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.470> lose<00:03:10.739> muscle<00:03:11.010> mass<00:03:11.190> you're

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
all costs if you lose muscle mass you're

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.720 
all costs if you lose muscle mass you're
going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.790> lose<00:03:12.739> not<00:03:13.739> only<00:03:13.800> strength<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:14.610> your

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
going to lose not only strength but your

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.940 
going to lose not only strength but your
metabolism<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.420> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> slow<00:03:15.810> down<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.320> you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
metabolism is going to slow down to you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.550 
metabolism is going to slow down to you
need<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.400> keep<00:03:17.580> your<00:03:17.640> muscle<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.600> your

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
need to keep your muscle on you your

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.580 
need to keep your muscle on you your
muscles<00:03:20.630> account<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:21.870> about<00:03:21.959> eighty<00:03:22.320> percent

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
muscles account for about eighty percent

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.890 
muscles account for about eighty percent
of<00:03:22.920> your<00:03:23.040> metabolism<00:03:23.940> your<00:03:24.480> overall

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
of your metabolism your overall

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.830 
of your metabolism your overall
metabolism<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.730> twenty<00:03:27.120> percent<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
metabolism and the twenty percent the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.420 
metabolism and the twenty percent the
other<00:03:27.900> twenty<00:03:28.320> percent<00:03:28.650> comes<00:03:28.950> from<00:03:29.130> training

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
other twenty percent comes from training

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.120 
other twenty percent comes from training
so<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.690> not<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.959> lot<00:03:31.200> twenty<00:03:31.650> percent<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
so that's not a lot twenty percent is

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.979 
so that's not a lot twenty percent is
nothing<00:03:32.519> obviously<00:03:33.390> those<00:03:33.540> numbers<00:03:33.870> are

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
nothing obviously those numbers are

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.870 
nothing obviously those numbers are
different<00:03:34.170> for<00:03:34.500> everybody<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.700> just

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
different for everybody but that's just

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.160 
different for everybody but that's just
approximate<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.430> no<00:03:38.670> changes<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.299> your<00:03:39.660> in

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
approximate so no changes in your in

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.990 
approximate so no changes in your in
your<00:03:40.470> muscle<00:03:40.980> mass<00:03:41.100> make<00:03:41.400> sure<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.610> hold<00:03:41.790> out

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
