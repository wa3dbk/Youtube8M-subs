 place 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.119
 For decades we have been intensively concerned with the issue of safety with the time factor 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 employed 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.510

 7 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.680
 then the responsive systems have evolved around accidents not at all 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.160
 start

 fit 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.560
 he thinks we are a bit too far ahead 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.940
 there

 the stellv 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.980
 the automobile gets reflexes 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.940
 the s-class dangerous situation 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.800
 Felix 80 activated Police have preventive protective measures

 and co-driver 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 move in their optimal protection positions 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 the inmates are optimally prepared for an accident

 If the accident does not take place the activated price is the measure

 Systems are this way of functioning
