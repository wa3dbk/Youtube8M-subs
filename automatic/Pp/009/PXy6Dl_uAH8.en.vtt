00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.279
 hello everyone with you 200 and today I tell you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 I will help you choose our future color 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.630
 bullshit so go well how do you know 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.359
 guys that most 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.029
 more precisely , many such question arose at 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 buying your bullseye especially if you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.159
 take the first first device from apple 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 that is, it is either the iphone and ipad or here 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.530
 and today I will help you choose black or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 white or white and better than black 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.969
 I want to immediately say guys think a lot 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 that black all yes this style and classics 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 such a strict strict such style between 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 than how white is more youthful 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 This type of fashion Yes, of course, I 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.809
 I did not rely guys I of course I 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.879
 the owner of the back door and without any sky 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.070
 The criterion I chose is why why am I the name 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.010
 took the black color definitely i like 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.050
 black color but still i didn't like it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.890
 in the white version as you can see it is black 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.299
 Malevich's square 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.090
 He clearly stands out for this white frame. 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.369
 but this is not the main thing also come out as 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.740
 the camera stands out the back of the guys 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 they are absolutely the same should not think 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.570
 that the black version has this strap from 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.630
 the fact that this is a black version of this module 3g 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 who doesn't know what else I haven't learned 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.780
 liked it in the white message why did you take 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 black as you see guys immediately you 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.000
 I will say that visually more screen on 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 black version so as you can notice 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 that u have a white version with a mind at the sides 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.469
 two bands are visible that is already in advance 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.210
 framed so narrowing yes then 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.280
 there is 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.970
 framework when such and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.540
 assuming the screen is smaller in white 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.500
 Versions than with black, of course, both screens 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.000
 same here when watching movies 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.450
 guys you have the same feeling 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.270
 that the film is bending some wound between 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.510
 so much as the black version is very screen 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.459
 leaves and visually it is really more but 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.590
 guys through the camera i hardly you 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.209
 It gives the feeling you will have the same 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.880
 of course 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.220
 go to the store and choose yourself 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.650
 daren color you like best 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.989
 but still u even for example jeans yes 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.440
 guys how is it that that's real for me 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.900
 through the camera it seems that live 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.970
 visually on black ipad and picture 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.870
 much more me much but she more 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.430
 than in white about the idea it's not because 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.860
 something i have vision problems and then 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.390
 because here we are this white 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.330
 and now this black frame which you 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.280
 see she pounds 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.130
 but rather makes the picture in the frame and its 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.200
 The size is clearly fixed in black pass 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.660
 such a teaching that there is no face and he 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.140
 slowly goes to the side of it well, personally 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.260
 so it seems, and many, many so 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.290
 speak because it is really visually 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.380
 the screen is bigger on black I repeat 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.519
 it all depends only personally different from your 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.019
 opinions well, that's the principle of everything i think video 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.560
