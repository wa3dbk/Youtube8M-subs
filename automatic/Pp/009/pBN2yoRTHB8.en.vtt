exacto knife around it yeah and then you

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:46.460 
exacto knife around it yeah and then you
can<00:01:31.509> just<00:01:31.750> start<00:01:31.960> texturing

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010 

though<00:01:46.980> as<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.730> see<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.390> textured

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
though as you can see I have textured

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.370 
though as you can see I have textured
one<00:01:49.350> macaron<00:01:50.040> shell<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:51.510> will<00:01:51.810> require<00:01:52.230> some

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
one macaron shell it will require some

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
one macaron shell it will require some
patience<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.700> definitely<00:01:54.150> worth<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.510> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
patience but it's definitely worth it so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.100 
patience but it's definitely worth it so
once<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.070> done<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.760> macaron<00:01:57.180> shell<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
once you have done one macaron shell you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:24.200 
once you have done one macaron shell you
can<00:01:58.410> make<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.130> other<00:01:59.400> micron<00:01:59.910> shell

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210

this<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:24.230> want<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.590> take<00:03:24.830> your<00:03:25.130> exacto<00:03:25.520> knife

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
this you want to take your exacto knife

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.130 
this you want to take your exacto knife
and<00:03:26.240> you<00:03:27.080> want<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.380> press<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.680> down<00:03:28.240> like<00:03:29.240> that

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
and you want to press it down like that

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.230 
and you want to press it down like that
and<00:03:30.740> then<00:03:31.550> kind<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.200> pinch<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.740> ear<00:03:34.090> around

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.660 

keeping<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.420> ends<00:03:38.600> like<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.960> flap<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:39.860> so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
keeping the ends like a flap but just so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.110 
keeping the ends like a flap but just so
it's<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.910> little<00:03:40.940> pinched

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
it's a little pinched

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.200 
it's a little pinched
add<00:03:43.659> that<00:03:44.080> to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
add that to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.920 
add that to
back<00:03:46.780> home

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.170 

and<00:03:53.080> then<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.860> do<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.159> same<00:03:54.370> thing<00:03:54.760> with

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
and then you can do the same thing with

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.460 
and then you can do the same thing with
the<00:03:55.540> other<00:03:55.840> ear

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
the other ear

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.220 
the other ear
and<00:03:57.560> then<00:03:58.040> once<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.760> have<00:03:59.030> your<00:03:59.240> ears<00:03:59.600> on<00:03:59.930> you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
and then once you have your ears on you

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.510 
and then once you have your ears on you
can<00:04:00.530> smooth<00:04:01.460> it<00:04:01.730> down<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:04.010> all<00:04:04.250> blended

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
can smooth it down so it's all blended

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.040 
can smooth it down so it's all blended
into<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.360> micron<00:04:05.900> shell

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.330 

so<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:11.800> should<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.880> something<00:04:13.240> like<00:04:13.480> this

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
so you should have something like this

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.820 
so you should have something like this
and<00:04:15.340> then<00:04:15.640> now<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.750> still<00:04:17.260> doesn't<00:04:17.530> really

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
and then now it still doesn't really

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.800 
and then now it still doesn't really
look<00:04:18.010> like<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.280> trough<00:04:18.670> but<00:04:18.940> that's<00:04:19.120> because<00:04:19.360> it

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
look like a trough but that's because it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.400 
look like a trough but that's because it
needs<00:04:20.080> their<00:04:20.410> little<00:04:20.680> antlers<00:04:21.960> so<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.020> want

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
needs their little antlers so you want

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.310 
needs their little antlers so you want
to<00:04:23.650> take<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.250> bowl<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.970> yellow<00:04:25.270> clay<00:04:25.510> for<00:04:26.200> each

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
to take a bowl of yellow clay for each

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.290 
to take a bowl of yellow clay for each
answer<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.160> then<00:04:27.400> just<00:04:27.430> roll<00:04:27.820> them<00:04:28.030> into

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
answer and then just roll them into

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.640 
answer and then just roll them into
little<00:04:28.630> logs<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:31.020> then<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.140> want<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.410> take

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650

two<00:04:32.950> little<00:04:33.160> round<00:04:33.550> balls<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.270> then

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.390 

on<00:04:39.490> two

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.480 

dot<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.660> top

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
dot on top

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.900

look shaped yellow

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.180 
look shaped yellow

and then you can do that with the other

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.600 
and then you can do that with the other
one<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.840> now<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.440> have<00:04:55.470> your<00:04:55.890> two<00:04:56.100> little
