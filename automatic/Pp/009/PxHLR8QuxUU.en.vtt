00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
even though that metal chassis all the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
even though that metal chassis all the
way<00:01:00.660> around<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> Lumia<00:01:01.379> icon<00:01:01.590> gives<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
way around the Lumia icon gives it a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
premium feel on the buttons I'd say the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
premium feel on the buttons I'd say the
icon<00:01:05.250> has<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> better<00:01:05.729> design

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.279 
the icon does have more horsepower than
the<00:04:52.100> Z<00:04:52.370> 30<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.880> won't<00:04:53.330> go<00:04:53.449> into<00:04:53.570> detail<00:04:54.050> I'll

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
the Z 30 I won't go into detail I'll

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.830 
the Z 30 I won't go into detail I'll
just<00:04:54.500> say<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:55.070> Lumia<00:04:55.400> has<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.580> quad<00:04:55.940> core<00:04:56.240> while

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
just say the Lumia has a quad core while

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.290 
just say the Lumia has a quad core while
the<00:04:56.990> z30<00:04:57.410> has<00:04:57.620> dual<00:04:57.889> core<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.030> doesn't

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
the z30 has dual core but that doesn't

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.909 
the z30 has dual core but that doesn't
really<00:04:59.389> matter<00:04:59.660> because<00:05:00.050> they<00:05:00.169> are<00:05:00.289> both<00:05:00.590> fast

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
really matter because they are both fast

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.890 
really matter because they are both fast
and<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.310> guess<00:05:01.550> they<00:05:01.940> performed<00:05:02.389> the<00:05:02.510> same<00:05:02.660> way

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
and I guess they performed the same way

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.170 
and I guess they performed the same way
except<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:03.770> icon<00:05:04.190> gets<00:05:04.430> hot<00:05:04.669> when<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.030> use

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
except that icon gets hot when you use

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.210 
except that icon gets hot when you use
it<00:05:05.330> for<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.510> couple<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:05.900> minutes<00:05:06.190> lastly<00:05:07.190> I

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
it for a couple of minutes lastly I

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.620 
it for a couple of minutes lastly I
would<00:05:07.430> like<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.760> talk<00:05:07.880> about<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.240> camera

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
would like to talk about the camera

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.320 
would like to talk about the camera
there<00:05:09.260> is<00:05:09.380> no<00:05:09.410> doubt<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:10.100> anyone's<00:05:10.699> mind<00:05:10.970> the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
there is no doubt on anyone's mind the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.960 
there is no doubt on anyone's mind the
Nokia<00:05:11.750> Lumia<00:05:11.780> icon<00:05:12.169> takes<00:05:12.889> this<00:05:13.070> one<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.789> has

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
Nokia Lumia icon takes this one it has

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.640 
Nokia Lumia icon takes this one it has
more<00:05:14.240> than<00:05:14.360> double<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.720> pixels<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.350> while

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
more than double the pixels and while

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.990 
more than double the pixels and while
that<00:05:15.800> pretty<00:05:16.070> much<00:05:16.220> says<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.699> all

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
that pretty much says it all

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.150 
that pretty much says it all
while<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.449> Z<00:05:17.599> 30<00:05:17.840> may<00:05:18.080> take<00:05:18.320> fast<00:05:18.650> pictures

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
while the Z 30 may take fast pictures

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.279 
while the Z 30 may take fast pictures
the<00:05:19.669> accuracy<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.210> clarity<00:05:20.630> goes<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.199> the

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
the accuracy and clarity goes to the

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.890 
the accuracy and clarity goes to the
icon<00:05:21.710> way<00:05:22.520> better<00:05:22.729> video<00:05:23.090> pictures<00:05:23.660> and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
icon way better video pictures and

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.510 
icon way better video pictures and
overall<00:05:24.259> better<00:05:24.590> camera<00:05:25.130> phone<00:05:25.310> in

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
overall better camera phone in

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.610 
overall better camera phone in
conclusion<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:26.599> think<00:05:26.960> there<00:05:27.080> are<00:05:27.110> both<00:05:27.320> great

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620
