00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.780 
first I'm going to try to achieve a cut
crease<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.050> am<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.860> apply<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.250> dark

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
crease so I am going to apply a dark

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.950 
crease so I am going to apply a dark
green<00:02:22.270> forest<00:02:23.080> eyeshadow<00:02:23.950> color<00:02:24.750> along<00:02:25.750> my

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
green forest eyeshadow color along my

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.850 
green forest eyeshadow color along my
crease

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.820 

basically<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.010> trick<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:35.590> trace<00:02:36.590> along

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
basically the trick is to trace along

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.820 
basically the trick is to trace along
the<00:02:37.040> blue<00:02:37.610> eye<00:02:37.880> shadow<00:02:38.410> not<00:02:39.410> blue<00:02:39.590> eye<00:02:39.800> shadow

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830
