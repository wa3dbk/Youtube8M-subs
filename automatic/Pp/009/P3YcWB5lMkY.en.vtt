00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.970 
and I thought it would be a great
opportunity<00:00:13.970> for<00:00:14.330> me<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:14.660> answer<00:00:15.170> a<00:00:15.440> question

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980

that's come in since we started to talk

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.769 
that's come in since we started to talk
about<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.529> dog<00:00:18.679> which<00:00:19.369> is<00:00:19.509> how<00:00:20.509> does<00:00:20.689> the

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
about the dog which is how does the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.269 
about the dog which is how does the
Duggar<00:00:20.960> fold<00:00:21.259> and<00:00:21.619> what<00:00:21.859> does<00:00:21.949> it<00:00:22.039> look<00:00:22.159> like

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
Duggar fold and what does it look like

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.859 
Duggar fold and what does it look like
when<00:00:22.460> it's<00:00:22.579> folded<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.390> I<00:00:23.419> thought<00:00:23.630> coming

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
when it's folded so I thought coming

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.540 
when it's folded so I thought coming
back<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.349> car<00:00:24.529> from<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:24.890> swamp<00:00:25.130> what<00:00:25.519> a

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
do is just you know fold up you can it

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.830 
do is just you know fold up you can it
be<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.650> little<00:00:36.770> bit<00:00:36.920> here<00:00:37.220> so<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:38.330> just

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
that's very very simple as you'll see on

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.690 
that's very very simple as you'll see on
the<00:00:43.880> side<00:00:46.690> as<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.750> can<00:00:47.930> see<00:00:48.110> on<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.350> side

there's two finger thingies so there's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.240 
there's two finger thingies so there's
one<00:00:51.650> here<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.820> I'll<00:00:52.940> spin<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.240> around<00:00:54.250> and

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
one here and I'll spin it around and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.540 
one here and I'll spin it around and
there's<00:00:55.580> one<00:00:55.760> here<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:57.110> all<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.130> do<00:00:58.310> is

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
okay and push down and you'll see it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.720 
okay and push down and you'll see it
folds<00:01:05.269> quite<00:01:05.990> nicely<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.590> then<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.580> have

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
folds quite nicely and then you have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.870 
folds quite nicely and then you have
this<00:01:07.880> latch<00:01:08.090> right<00:01:08.360> here<00:01:08.860> alright<00:01:09.880> just

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
this latch right here alright just

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.110 
this latch right here alright just
simply<00:01:11.240> bring<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.690> latch<00:01:11.840> around<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.909> hook

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
simply bring the latch around and hook

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.180 
simply bring the latch around and hook
it<00:01:14.210> up<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:15.260> can<00:01:15.409> either<00:01:15.560> turn<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.920> wheel

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
it up and you can either turn the wheel

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.190 
it up and you can either turn the wheel
in<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:17.150> make<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.420> little<00:01:17.479> bit<00:01:17.690> more<00:01:17.840> compact

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
in to make it a little bit more compact

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.730 
in to make it a little bit more compact
if<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.530> like<00:01:18.680> or<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.370> can<00:01:19.400> leave<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.670> out<00:01:19.880> so

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
if you like or you can leave it out so

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.930 
if you like or you can leave it out so
let<00:01:21.740> me<00:01:21.800> just<00:01:21.950> show<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.100> how<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.460> works<00:01:22.550> I<00:01:22.790> have

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
let me just show you how it works I have

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.460 
let me just show you how it works I have
a<00:01:22.970> Mazda<00:01:23.300> Protege<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.170> very<00:01:24.350> typical

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
a Mazda Protege it's a very typical

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.070 
a Mazda Protege it's a very typical
average<00:01:25.190> car<00:01:25.460> normal<00:01:26.270> trunk<00:01:26.479> size<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.960> it

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
average car normal trunk size and it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:45.610 
average car normal trunk size and it
fits<00:01:27.260> great<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:27.650> let's<00:01:27.800> take<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> look

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.030 

there<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.680> go

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there you go

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
there you go
so<00:01:47.310> let's<00:01:47.820> take<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:47.970> look<00:01:48.120> at<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.450> fits<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
so let's take a look at how it fits in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:02:01.700 
so let's take a look at how it fits in
the<00:01:48.780> trunk<00:01:59.870> great<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.410> it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the trunk great so there you have it

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.430 
the trunk great so there you have it
very<00:02:01.920> simple<00:02:02.820> easy<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.360> fold<00:02:03.690> because<00:02:04.140> it's

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
very simple easy to fold because it's

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.350 
very simple easy to fold because it's
aluminum<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.220> lightweight<00:02:05.430> fits<00:02:06.150> into

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
aluminum it's very lightweight fits into

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.090 
aluminum it's very lightweight fits into
most<00:02:06.480> trunks<00:02:06.840> quite<00:02:07.050> easily<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:07.920> said<00:02:08.070> I

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
most trunks quite easily like I said I

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.680 
most trunks quite easily like I said I
think<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.460> pretty<00:02:08.640> typical<00:02:08.850> trunk<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
think I'm a pretty typical trunk and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.500 
think I'm a pretty typical trunk and
that's<00:02:10.649> how<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> pull<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.250> dogger<00:02:11.460> so<00:02:12.120> once

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that's how you pull the dogger so once

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.570 
that's how you pull the dogger so once
