together<00:01:02.489> off<00:01:02.820> fighting<00:01:03.090> bosses<00:01:04.880> obviously

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
together off fighting bosses obviously

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
together off fighting bosses obviously
some<00:01:06.119> bosses<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:06.810> easier<00:01:06.990> than<00:01:07.140> others

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
some bosses are lot easier than others

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.000 
some bosses are lot easier than others
and<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:07.920> were<00:01:08.850> extremely<00:01:09.510> long<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and some were extremely long for me to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
and some were extremely long for me to
kill<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> pests<00:01:11.670> Queen<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> took<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.540> 10

minutes<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.820> maybe<00:01:14.820> took<00:01:15.210> me<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.509> longer

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
minutes or so maybe took me a bit longer

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
minutes or so maybe took me a bit longer

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
which I did quite easily in one

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
which I did quite easily in one
inventory<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.219> another<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.420> kill<00:01:57.630> two

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
inventory and another one is to kill two

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.030 
inventory and another one is to kill two
nomads<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.930> inventory<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.200> food

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
nomads with just one inventory of food

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.649 
nomads with just one inventory of food
or<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.549> without<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.149> back<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> bank

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
or one without going back to the bank

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.200 
or one without going back to the bank
really<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.399> decided<00:02:05.520> let<00:02:05.969> okay

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
really so I kind of decided let okay

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.510 
really so I kind of decided let okay
I'll<00:02:06.329> try<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.540> out<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.619> end<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> lot

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
I'll try it out in the end it was a lot

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.229 
I'll try it out in the end it was a lot
harder<00:02:08.700> than<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> expected<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:11.120> think<00:02:12.120> me

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
harder than I can I expected I think me

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.790 
harder than I can I expected I think me
because<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> thought<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.530> was

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
because I thought it was

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.370 
because I thought it was
it<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.970> had<00:02:15.270> recently<00:02:15.810> been<00:02:15.990> told

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
it was because I had recently been told

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.790 
it was because I had recently been told
that<00:02:16.680> no<00:02:17.310> man<00:02:17.520> was<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.970> easy<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.510> kill<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:19.680> can

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that no man was so easy to kill you can

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.850 
that no man was so easy to kill you can
easy<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.670> few<00:02:20.910> hits<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:22.320> did<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
easy do in just a few hits and I did a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.100 
easy do in just a few hits and I did a
bit<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.070> research<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.690> reason<00:02:24.990> why

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
bit of research and the reason why

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.840 
bit of research and the reason why
people<00:02:25.320> said<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:25.890> easy<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.280> because<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
people said is so easy is because that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.390 
people said is so easy is because that
was<00:02:27.480> when<00:02:27.900> evolution<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> combat<00:02:28.920> came<00:02:29.250> out

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
was when evolution of combat came out

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.560 
was when evolution of combat came out
you<00:02:29.490> could<00:02:29.610> pretty<00:02:29.730> much<00:02:29.820> cure<00:02:30.180> nomads<00:02:30.540> in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
you could pretty much cure nomads in

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.440 
you could pretty much cure nomads in
just<00:02:30.990> two<00:02:31.260> hits<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.850> obviously<00:02:32.850> they

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
just two hits and obviously they

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.510 
just two hits and obviously they
balanced<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.170> again<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.100> was<00:02:35.430> like

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
balanced it out again so I was like

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.670 
balanced it out again so I was like
expecting<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.510> bit<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.750> an<00:02:36.840> easy<00:02:37.050> fight<00:02:37.410> you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
expecting a bit of an easy fight you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 
expecting a bit of an easy fight you
know<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.040> didn't<00:02:38.910> know<00:02:39.000> they<00:02:39.180> could<00:02:39.240> be

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
know I didn't know they could be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
know I didn't know they could be
balanced<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.020> didn't<00:02:40.290> ever<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:40.800> hard

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
balanced it if I didn't ever be as hard

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.910 
balanced it if I didn't ever be as hard
as<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.220> was<00:02:41.400> before<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:42.120> died<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.650> once

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
as it was before I died just once

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.440 
as it was before I died just once
because<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.400> ran<00:02:44.610> out<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.790> food<00:02:45.030> because<00:02:45.420> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
because I ran out of food because I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.510 
because I ran out of food because I
wasn't<00:02:45.660> using<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.110> pack<00:02:46.290> yak<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.860> then<00:02:47.490> I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
wasn't using a pack yak and then I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.070 
wasn't using a pack yak and then I
decided<00:02:47.820> okay<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.330> pancake<00:02:48.570> would<00:02:48.960> be

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
decided okay like a pancake would be

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.230 
decided okay like a pancake would be
great<00:02:49.350> for<00:02:49.530> me<00:02:49.650> because<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.310> was<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:50.970> close<00:02:51.150> to

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
great for me because I was so close to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640 
great for me because I was so close to
killing<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.690> second<00:02:51.960> one<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.410> needed

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
killing the second one but all I needed

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.200 
killing the second one but all I needed
was<00:02:52.800> like<00:02:53.010> five<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:53.460> six<00:02:53.550> more<00:02:53.730> foods<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
was like five or six more foods and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.390 
was like five or six more foods and
would<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.420> done<00:02:54.570> great<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:55.980> said<00:02:56.130> okay<00:02:56.370> I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
would have done great so I said okay I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.850 
would have done great so I said okay I
bring<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.610> pack<00:02:56.790> yak<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> be<00:02:57.360> safe<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
bring a pack yak just to be safe and I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.180 
bring a pack yak just to be safe and I
was<00:02:59.480> pretty<00:03:00.480> good<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.410> second

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
was pretty good you know on the second

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.580 
was pretty good you know on the second
try<00:03:02.400> but<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.330> first<00:03:03.570> try<00:03:03.810> took<00:03:04.020> me<00:03:04.140> about<00:03:04.260> 10

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
try but the first try took me about 10

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.800 
try but the first try took me about 10
to<00:03:04.710> 15<00:03:04.830> minutes<00:03:05.040> or<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.510> second

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
to 15 minutes or so and then the second

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.420 
to 15 minutes or so and then the second
one<00:03:06.840> took<00:03:07.050> me<00:03:07.200> about<00:03:07.320> 10<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.710> 15<00:03:07.830> minutes<00:03:08.220> to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
one took me about 10 to 15 minutes to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.400 
one took me about 10 to 15 minutes to
kill<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.390> second<00:03:09.750> time<00:03:09.900> was<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.080> lot<00:03:10.260> easier

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
kill it the second time was a lot easier

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.200 
kill it the second time was a lot easier
for<00:03:10.620> some<00:03:10.920> weird<00:03:11.130> reason<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.790> must<00:03:11.970> have<00:03:12.000> take

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
for some weird reason it must have take

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.370 
for some weird reason it must have take
me<00:03:12.890> less<00:03:13.890> hits<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.490> bought<00:03:15.060> her<00:03:15.810> potions<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
me less hits I bought her potions and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.380

not<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.470> hardest<00:03:34.739> ones<00:03:34.980> these<00:03:35.250> are<00:03:35.310> one<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
not the hardest ones these are one of

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.490 
not the hardest ones these are one of
the<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.270> evil<00:03:36.630> chicken<00:03:36.989> was<00:03:37.140> one<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.410> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the the evil chicken was one of the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.340 
the the evil chicken was one of the
easiest<00:03:37.950> ones<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.670> one<00:03:38.850> was<00:03:38.970> about

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
easiest ones and this one was about

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.470 
easiest ones and this one was about
third<00:03:40.350> down<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.650> list<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.940> think<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.360> as

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
third down the list and I think that as

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.790 
third down the list and I think that as
you<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.720> down<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.050> list<00:03:43.230> does<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> lot

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
you get down the list does get a lot

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.650 
you get down the list does get a lot
harder<00:03:43.980> which<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.090> kind<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.420> shame<00:03:45.630> really

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
harder which is kind of a shame really

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.470 
harder which is kind of a shame really
but<00:03:46.200> i<00:03:46.470> will<00:03:47.340> start<00:03:47.520> doing<00:03:47.670> more<00:03:47.850> today<00:03:48.209> and
