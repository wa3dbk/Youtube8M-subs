00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.470 
did learn some valuable lessons and I
learned<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.550> can<00:02:51.790> make<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.240> through

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
learned that you can make it through

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.680 
learned that you can make it through
tough<00:02:52.750> situations<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.420> don't<00:02:55.690> let

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
tough situations that you don't let

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.250 
tough situations that you don't let
situations<00:02:58.690> or<00:02:58.840> people<00:02:59.110> deter<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.430> from

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
situations or people deter you from

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.780 
situations or people deter you from
pressing<00:03:02.260> forward<00:03:03.540> were<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.040> an<00:03:06.040> excellent

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
pressing forward were you an excellent

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.550 
pressing forward were you an excellent
student<00:03:07.030> no<00:03:07.600> not<00:03:08.170> by<00:03:08.440> any<00:03:08.680> means<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:11.200> good

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
student no not by any means I was good

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.060 
student no not by any means I was good
at<00:03:11.709> some<00:03:11.980> things<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.240> would<00:03:13.420> never<00:03:14.070> call

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
at some things but I would never call

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.830 
at some things but I would never call
myself<00:03:15.310> an<00:03:15.820> excellent<00:03:16.480> student<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.490> flunked

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
myself an excellent student I flunked

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.530 
myself an excellent student I flunked
geometry<00:03:19.840> four<00:03:20.110> times<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.910> each<00:03:22.150> time<00:03:22.209> I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
geometry four times and each time I

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.690 
geometry four times and each time I
failed<00:03:22.990> it<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.380> think<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.770> failed<00:03:24.040> with<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> lower

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
failed it I think I failed with a lower

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.290 
failed it I think I failed with a lower
grade<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:26.440> fact<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.990> had<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.200> repeat

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
grade and in fact I had to repeat

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.860 
grade and in fact I had to repeat
geometry<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:32.620> summer<00:03:33.489> school<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:34.209> year<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.780> I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
geometry in summer school one year and I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.460 
geometry in summer school one year and I
even<00:03:35.110> failed<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:35.890> summer<00:03:36.250> school<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:37.470> did

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
even failed it in summer school and did

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.949 
even failed it in summer school and did
I<00:03:38.500> catch<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.160> for<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.670> because<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.690> had<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
I catch it for that because you had to

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.070 
I catch it for that because you had to
pay<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.200> go<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.530> summer<00:03:41.980> school<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:43.080> my

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
pay to go to summer school and my

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.280 
pay to go to summer school and my
parents<00:03:44.320> said<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:45.400> can't<00:03:45.790> even<00:03:46.150> pass<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:47.050> when

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
parents said you can't even pass it when

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.180 
parents said you can't even pass it when
we're<00:03:47.500> paying<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:49.840> lousy<00:03:50.440> at<00:03:50.860> math

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
we're paying for it I was lousy at math

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.920 
we're paying for it I was lousy at math
I<00:03:52.739> hated<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.250> didn't<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:54.940> algebra<00:03:55.870> I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
I hated it I didn't like algebra I

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.160 
I hated it I didn't like algebra I
didn't<00:03:56.200> like<00:03:56.410> geometry<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:59.280> never<00:04:00.420> saw<00:04:01.420> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
didn't like geometry I never saw the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.830 
didn't like geometry I never saw the
need<00:04:02.410> for<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:03.070> because<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:03.940> was<00:04:04.150> convinced<00:04:04.720> I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
need for it because I was convinced I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.320 
need for it because I was convinced I
was<00:04:04.959> never<00:04:05.230> gonna<00:04:05.470> use<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:06.190> my<00:04:06.760> lifetime

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
was never gonna use it in my lifetime

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.660 
was never gonna use it in my lifetime
and<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.690> didn't<00:04:07.989> see<00:04:08.260> why<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.620> needed<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.310> study

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
and I didn't see why I needed to study

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.060 
and I didn't see why I needed to study
it<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:10.090> was<00:04:11.070> lousy<00:04:12.070> at<00:04:12.519> mathematics<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:14.560> was<00:04:14.830> good

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
it I was lousy at mathematics I was good

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.240

student and when you when you got ready

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.690 
student and when you when you got ready
to<00:04:34.060> graduate<00:04:34.330> was<00:04:34.900> there<00:04:35.229> was<00:04:35.979> there<00:04:36.160> thought

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
to graduate was there was there thought

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.899 
to graduate was there was there thought
of<00:04:37.000> going<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.450> college

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.219 

they're<00:04:40.909> not<00:04:41.349> not<00:04:42.349> really<00:04:43.129> I<00:04:44.120> wasn't<00:04:45.080> good

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
they're not not really I wasn't good

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.909 
they're not not really I wasn't good
enough<00:04:45.259> to<00:04:45.620> get<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.830> scholarship<00:04:46.039> and<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:48.560> was

enough to get a scholarship and that was

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.520 
enough to get a scholarship and that was
