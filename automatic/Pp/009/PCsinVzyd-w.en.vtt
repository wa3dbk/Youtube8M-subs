hey guys in this video to do a quick
acting<00:00:02.970> speed<00:00:03.240> test<00:00:03.480> comparison<00:00:04.350> between<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
acting speed test comparison between the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.299 
acting speed test comparison between the
Samsung<00:00:05.940> Galaxy<00:00:06.120> a5<00:00:06.660> versus<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.770> Google

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
Samsung Galaxy a5 versus the Google

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.370 
Samsung Galaxy a5 versus the Google
Nexus<00:00:08.610> 5<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.929> can<00:00:10.050> see<00:00:10.260> both<00:00:10.559> devices<00:00:10.860> are

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
Nexus 5 you can see both devices are

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.470 
Nexus 5 you can see both devices are
pretty<00:00:13.380> much<00:00:13.469> faster<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.460> terms<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.880> their<00:00:15.120> use

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
pretty much faster in terms of their use

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.990 
pretty much faster in terms of their use
a<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.320> Snapdragon<00:00:17.010> processor<00:00:17.850> on

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
a so we have Snapdragon processor on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.990 
a so we have Snapdragon processor on
both<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.980> Nexus<00:00:20.340> 5<00:00:20.490> comes<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
both one so the Nexus 5 comes to the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.580 
both one so the Nexus 5 comes to the
clock<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.480> 2.3<00:00:22.020> gigahertz

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
clock on 2.3 gigahertz

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.009 
clock on 2.3 gigahertz
while<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.220> comes<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.789> Qualcomm<00:00:24.420> 410

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
while this one comes with a Qualcomm 410

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.269 
while this one comes with a Qualcomm 410
so<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.710> fun<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.010> compare<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.029> 32-bit<00:00:27.570> 64-bit<00:00:28.279> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so be fun to compare so 32-bit 64-bit so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
so be fun to compare so 32-bit 64-bit so
I'm<00:00:29.400> gonna<00:00:29.519> opening<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.359> gonna<00:00:30.570> open<00:00:30.660> up

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I'm gonna opening up I'm gonna open up

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
I'm gonna opening up I'm gonna open up
some<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> system<00:00:32.700> based<00:00:32.880> apps<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
some all for the system based apps so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.350 
some all for the system based apps so
first<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> open<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.579> camera

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
first we are going to open up camera

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.729 
first we are going to open up camera
let's<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:36.870> close<00:00:37.170> everything<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
let's first close everything in the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.360 
let's first close everything in the
background<00:00:43.460> software<00:00:44.460> wise<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:46.370> running

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
background software wise this is running

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
background software wise this is running

Android 4.4 KitKat so we have in latest

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.660 
Android 4.4 KitKat so we have in latest
one<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> course<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.160> Nexus<00:00:56.460> device

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
one of course this is Nexus device

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.520 
one of course this is Nexus device
that's<00:00:56.969> why<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> latest<00:00:57.899> updates<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that's why we have the latest updates a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.189 
that's why we have the latest updates a
Weibull<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.120> let's<00:01:00.570> quickly<00:01:00.750> launch<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
Weibull so let's quickly launch the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.630 
Weibull so let's quickly launch the
camera<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:02.039> two<00:01:02.219> three<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:04.430> okay<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
camera here one two three go okay it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.940 
camera here one two three go okay it
looks<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:05.939> Nexus<00:01:06.600> 5<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.860> bit

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
looks like Nexus 5 was a little bit

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
looks like Nexus 5 was a little bit
quicker<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:08.549> both<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> fern

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
quicker they're both have the fern

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
quicker they're both have the fern
facing<00:01:10.290> camera<00:01:10.560> already<00:01:10.830> opened<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.310> let's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
facing camera already opened up let's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.680 
facing camera already opened up let's
switch<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> back<00:01:12.930> camera<00:01:16.040> okay

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.039 

and<00:01:21.690> thus<00:01:22.170> capture<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.710> photo<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:27.049> skeptic

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and thus capture if photo a skeptic

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.930 
and thus capture if photo a skeptic
photo<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.220> camera<00:01:29.250> let's<00:01:29.790> see

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
photo using the back camera let's see

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.570 
photo using the back camera let's see
which<00:01:30.119> device<00:01:30.420> will<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> faster<00:01:31.460> catching<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
which device will be faster catching the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.710 
which device will be faster catching the
photo<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> let's<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.250> this

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
photo so let's do this

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.920 
photo so let's do this
let's<00:01:36.720> disable<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.380> flash<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
let's disable the flash you can see the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.410 
let's disable the flash you can see the
Nexus<00:01:43.229> 5<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.619> faster<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.250> capturing<00:01:44.759> photos<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
Nexus 5 is faster in capturing photos it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.200 
Nexus 5 is faster in capturing photos it
does<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.049> time<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.700> 5<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
does take some time here on the a 5 to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.830 
does take some time here on the a 5 to
process<00:01:48.690> but<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.940> kind<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.720> like

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
process but we do have a kind of like

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.400 
process but we do have a kind of like
slight<00:01:52.140> better<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> say<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> better

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
slight better you can say that better

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.880 
slight better you can say that better
result<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.100> images<00:01:56.460> or<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> Nexus<00:01:57.509> 5<00:01:57.890> I've

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
result in images or the Nexus 5 I've

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.290 
result in images or the Nexus 5 I've
done<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> camera<00:01:59.520> test<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:01:59.970> check<00:02:00.179> my

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
done the camera test you can check my

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.560 
done the camera test you can check my
channel<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.470> if<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:03.030> into<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
channel out so if we go here into the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.639 
channel out so if we go here into the
dialer<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.100> three<00:02:05.130> go<00:02:06.440> both<00:02:07.440> were

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
dialer I see one two three go both were

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.550 
dialer I see one two three go both were
extremely<00:02:08.280> equal<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:09.080> let's<00:02:10.080> try<00:02:10.229> opening

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
extremely equal there let's try opening

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
extremely equal there let's try opening
up<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.250> default<00:02:11.580> calculator<00:02:12.510> app<00:02:14.989> let's<00:02:15.989> see

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
up the default calculator app let's see

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.020 
up the default calculator app let's see
here<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> calculator<00:02:17.400> about<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.819> one

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
here we have a calculator about the one

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.390 
here we have a calculator about the one
that's<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.860> two<00:02:20.190> three<00:02:20.489> go<00:02:21.890> well<00:02:22.890> when<00:02:23.040> X<00:02:23.160> Y

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
that's one two three go well when X Y

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.530 
that's one two three go well when X Y
was<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:24.060> quicker<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.910> all<00:02:27.299> there's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
was really quicker there are all there's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.819 
was really quicker there are all there's
not<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.900> much<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.260> speed<00:02:28.500> difference

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
not that much of a speed difference

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.850 
not that much of a speed difference
let's<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.690> time<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:31.500> two<00:02:31.650> three

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
let's do it one more time one two three

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.890 
let's do it one more time one two three
go<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> both<00:02:34.049> were<00:02:34.200> equal<00:02:36.500> okay

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
go so both were equal okay

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.250 
go so both were equal okay
let's<00:02:39.900> try<00:02:40.079> opening<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.660> contacts<00:02:42.660> app<00:02:42.870> on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
let's try opening up the contacts app on

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.410 
let's try opening up the contacts app on
both<00:02:43.620> devices<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.549> contacts<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.390> both

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
both devices so we have contacts on both

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.920 
both devices so we have contacts on both
of<00:02:45.810> them<00:02:46.370> let's<00:02:47.370> do<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.180> three<00:02:48.510> go

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
of them let's do this one two three go

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.199 
of them let's do this one two three go
looks<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> Nexus<00:02:52.530> 5<00:02:52.920> has<00:02:52.950> ash<00:02:53.730> there

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.420 

let's<00:02:57.209> check<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:58.290> more<00:02:58.500> app<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.950> will

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
let's check out one more app that will

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.740 
let's check out one more app that will
be<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.030> messaging<00:03:03.600> app<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
be the messaging app that we have on the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.860 
be the messaging app that we have on the
screen<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.519> use<00:03:08.970> table<00:03:09.209> SMS<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:09.720> my

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
screen here so I use table SMS as my

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.539 
screen here so I use table SMS as my
default<00:03:10.019> app<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.560> I'll<00:03:10.650> be<00:03:10.769> opening<00:03:11.130> up<00:03:11.310> this

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
default app so I'll be opening up this

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.039 
default app so I'll be opening up this
one<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:12.840> two<00:03:13.019> three<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:14.450> okay<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.870> one

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
one so one two three go okay so this one

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.560 
one so one two three go okay so this one
is<00:03:16.079> quicker<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.820> let's<00:03:17.820> try<00:03:18.030> opening<00:03:18.390> up

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
is quicker there let's try opening up

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.960 
is quicker there let's try opening up
the<00:03:18.930> different<00:03:19.709> messaging<00:03:20.400> app<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.760> then

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
the different messaging app on then

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.400 
the different messaging app on then
mixes<00:03:21.269> five<00:03:23.090> maybe<00:03:24.090> hangouts<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.079> default

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
mixes five maybe hangouts is the default

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
mixes five maybe hangouts is the default
one<00:03:25.590> if<00:03:25.950> I'm<00:03:26.100> right<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> let's<00:03:28.079> students<00:03:29.150> want

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
one if I'm right so let's students want

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.780 
one if I'm right so let's students want
it<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.420> go

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.120 

okay<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.850> course<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.390> don't<00:03:35.110> use<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:35.860> you're

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
okay of course I don't use it so you're

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.040 
okay of course I don't use it so you're
awesome<00:03:36.600> stop<00:03:37.600> there

awesome stop there
I<00:03:38.080> don't<00:03:38.740> want<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.950> alter<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.670> don't<00:03:39.850> want

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
I don't want to alter that I don't want

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.320 
I don't want to alter that I don't want
to<00:03:40.030> waste<00:03:40.150> time<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:41.490> let's<00:03:42.490> try<00:03:42.700> opening<00:03:43.210> up

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
to waste time here let's try opening up

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.800 
to waste time here let's try opening up
some<00:03:43.920> more<00:03:44.920> apps<00:03:45.190> let's<00:03:46.000> see<00:03:46.240> which<00:03:46.510> apps

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
some more apps let's see which apps

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.790 
some more apps let's see which apps
should<00:03:46.990> I<00:03:47.050> open<00:03:47.290> up<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:48.870> geek<00:03:49.870> bench<00:03:50.020> app<00:03:50.410> which

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
should I open up a geek bench app which

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.820 
should I open up a geek bench app which
will<00:03:50.950> be<00:03:51.100> fun<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.370> open<00:03:51.640> one<00:03:52.600> two<00:03:52.630> three<00:03:53.020> go

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.140 

okay<00:03:56.830> so<00:03:56.890> let's<00:03:57.520> accept<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:58.450> do<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.720> again

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.290 

close<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.450> movie<00:04:05.020> game<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
close this movie game so this is the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.790 
close this movie game so this is the
geek<00:04:07.450> pen<00:04:07.630> 3<00:04:07.840> app<00:04:08.050> which<00:04:08.320> is<00:04:08.410> used<00:04:08.680> to

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
geek pen 3 app which is used to

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.080 
geek pen 3 app which is used to
benchmark<00:04:09.370> advices<00:04:11.220> 1<00:04:12.220> 2<00:04:12.370> 3<00:04:12.489> go

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
benchmark advices 1 2 3 go

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.060 
benchmark advices 1 2 3 go
I<00:04:13.590> think<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.680> Nexus<00:04:15.040> 5<00:04:15.390> was<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:17.019> little<00:04:17.739> bit

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
I think the Nexus 5 was a little bit

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.130 
I think the Nexus 5 was a little bit
like<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.730> second<00:04:19.060> there<00:04:19.239> short<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> text

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
like the second there short the text

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.870 
like the second there short the text
first

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
first

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.550 
first
but<00:04:21.880> overall<00:04:22.240> both<00:04:22.390> were<00:04:22.570> equal<00:04:22.930> they're<00:04:23.110> so

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
but overall both were equal they're so

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.430 
but overall both were equal they're so
very<00:04:23.950> equal<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:24.940> terms<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.270> speed<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.570> this<00:04:26.260> is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
very equal in terms of speed and this is

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.930 
very equal in terms of speed and this is
a<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:26.650> point<00:04:26.800> four<00:04:27.010> gears<00:04:27.190> quad-core

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
a one point four gears quad-core

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.470 
a one point four gears quad-core
processor<00:04:28.390> this<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.690> 2.3<00:04:29.200> gigahertz<00:04:29.370> 32-bit

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
processor this is 2.3 gigahertz 32-bit

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.620 
processor this is 2.3 gigahertz 32-bit
64-bit<00:04:31.480> starting<00:04:32.260> 410<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:32.950> stopping<00:04:33.850> at<00:04:34.030> 800

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
64-bit starting 410 and stopping at 800

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.680 
64-bit starting 410 and stopping at 800
so<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.200> one<00:04:35.410> has<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.680> powerful<00:04:36.010> GPU<00:04:36.640> but<00:04:37.300> you

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
so this one has a powerful GPU but you

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.270 
so this one has a powerful GPU but you
can<00:04:37.840> see<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.350> daily<00:04:38.590> tasks<00:04:38.950> in

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
can see that in daily tasks in

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.219 
can see that in daily tasks in
day-to-day<00:04:39.700> usage<00:04:40.030> opening<00:04:40.750> apps<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.140> all

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
day-to-day usage opening apps and all

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.580 
day-to-day usage opening apps and all
that<00:04:41.440> both<00:04:41.979> are<00:04:42.250> very<00:04:42.910> fast<00:04:43.330> very<00:04:43.810> equal

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
that both are very fast very equal

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.580 
that both are very fast very equal
they're<00:04:44.830> not<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.520> much<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.910> difference

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
they're not that much of a difference

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.730 
they're not that much of a difference
but<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:48.490> all<00:04:48.700> say<00:04:48.880> fun<00:04:49.210> video<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.630> do<00:04:49.810> if<00:04:50.320> you

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
but that all say fun video to do if you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.130 
but that all say fun video to do if you
want<00:04:50.950> some<00:04:51.160> more<00:04:51.570> comparison<00:04:52.570> do<00:04:52.810> let<00:04:52.990> me<00:04:53.020> know

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
want some more comparison do let me know

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.270 
want some more comparison do let me know
