00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.099
 today we make a healthy recipe for 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.290
 sole we need a container of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.139
 oven that is large enough to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.359
 house the sole and we put a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.240
 good jet of olive oil we peel and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.850
 we wash very well all the potatoes and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.300
 cut into slices like a finger 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.300
 thickness 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.230
 and we put them in the container 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 forming a bed 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.520
 I did not like how the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.520
 last potato and the change 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.640
 now we cut the onions also in 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.250
 medallions as of a finger thick at 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:59.170
 just like the potatoes and we put them 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.170
 forming a second bed 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.129
 we clean the pepper 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.660
 and cut it into thin and elongated strips 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.229
 Y 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.789
 we place them in the tray on top of the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789
 onion 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.040
 we now go to cut the lemons 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.429
 again in medallions 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.040
 we put them in the tray but we keep 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.400
 three to put them later on top of the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.400
 sole 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.520
 enriches that we can hold on 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.310
 it must be preheated to 190 degrees 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.010
 sense at 375 degrees Fahrenheit 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 we leave the vegetables half an hour now 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.610
 enrique if he wears gloves will be that 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.350
 learned the lesson 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.350
 and introduce the sole 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.560
 a little salt and the three slices of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.930
 lemon that we had booked a glass of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.950
 white wine we use one that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.599
 we make home 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.930
 here we leave you the recipe if you want 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.930
 avenge 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.220
 a trickle of olive oil and what 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.500
 We left in the oven for another half hour 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.840
 the sole because of its shape so 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.510
 crushed does not need more time to 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.420
 to make is a fish that looks a little 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.420
 Ugly but its taste is extraordinary 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.570
 and that's how it looks like we hope you 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.570
 like and health for all 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.730
 Y
