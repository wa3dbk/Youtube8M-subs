00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
can just run in there which is likely to

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.099 
can just run in there which is likely to
happen<00:04:14.200> somewhat<00:04:15.200> often<00:04:16.180> huh<00:04:18.220> hmm<00:04:19.630> yeah<00:04:20.630> all

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
right so we're going to do with a lot of

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.670 
right so we're going to do with a lot of
this<00:04:26.140> cobblestone<00:04:27.140> that<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.410> got<00:04:27.620> right<00:04:27.830> here

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
this cobblestone that I got right here

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.409 
this cobblestone that I got right here
mmm<00:04:30.680> stack<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.550> eight<00:04:31.700> your<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.120> worthless

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
mmm stack of eight your you worthless

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.640 
mmm stack of eight your you worthless
Earth<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.870> me<00:04:32.960> right<00:04:33.110> now<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:35.150> right<00:04:37.390> mmm

Earth to me right now all right mmm

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.230 
Earth to me right now all right mmm
actually<00:04:40.360> let's<00:04:41.360> see<00:04:41.570> if<00:04:41.630> we<00:04:41.750> can't<00:04:42.050> dig

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
actually let's see if we can't dig

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.170 
actually let's see if we can't dig
little<00:04:44.240> staircase<00:04:44.510> up<00:04:45.790> not<00:04:46.790> quite<00:04:47.150> the

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
little staircase up not quite the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.100 
little staircase up not quite the
stairway<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> heaven<00:04:48.200> but<00:04:48.350> it<00:04:48.680> works<00:04:50.110> all

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
stairway to heaven but it works all

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.390 
stairway to heaven but it works all
right<00:04:52.150> well<00:04:53.150> let's<00:04:53.690> get<00:04:54.020> this<00:04:54.320> on<00:04:57.250> we're<00:04:58.250> gonna

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
right well let's get this on we're gonna

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.350 
right well let's get this on we're gonna
do<00:04:58.810> don't<00:04:59.810> want<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.140> make<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.979> enormous

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.340 

yeah<00:05:05.360> that's<00:05:05.600> probably<00:05:06.430> too<00:05:07.430> big<00:05:07.669> right<00:05:07.700> there

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
yeah that's probably too big right there

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.460 
yeah that's probably too big right there
we're<00:05:10.350> gonna<00:05:10.500> make<00:05:10.710> us<00:05:11.039> a<00:05:11.310> tower<00:05:11.639> and<00:05:12.470> I

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
we're gonna make us a tower and I

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.990 
we're gonna make us a tower and I
probably<00:05:13.710> don't<00:05:13.919> have<00:05:14.039> enough<00:05:15.110> cobblestone

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
probably don't have enough cobblestone

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.640 
probably don't have enough cobblestone
but<00:05:19.130> we're<00:05:20.130> going<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.280> try<00:05:20.400> anyway<00:05:21.259> the<00:05:22.259> idea

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
but we're going to try anyway the idea

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.620 
but we're going to try anyway the idea
is<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.400> make<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> giant<00:05:24.030> Tower<00:05:24.360> look<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:26.630> can

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
is if I make a giant Tower look I can

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.560 
is if I make a giant Tower look I can
connect<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.759> to<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.870> fort<00:05:31.850> how<00:05:32.850> well<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.509> can

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
connect it to the fort how well I can

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.600 
connect it to the fort how well I can
switch<00:05:34.350> between<00:05:34.470> calling<00:05:34.979> it<00:05:35.160> a<00:05:35.220> fort<00:05:35.490> in<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
switch between calling it a fort in the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.129 
switch between calling it a fort in the
house<00:05:35.729> I<00:05:36.000> haven't<00:05:36.270> really<00:05:36.830> actually<00:05:38.690> mmm<00:05:39.690> I<00:05:40.080> do

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139
