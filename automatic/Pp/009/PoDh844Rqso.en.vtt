00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.040
 and a faucet has still 500 hours left 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.899
 and another one 3 hours ago then how many hours does it miss 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.719
 I do this to solve for the famous quotes in formula work in 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.619
 team laurie there 2 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.720
 percent article tenth case already right now 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.560
 who do a job individually for a certain time 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.090
 12 if they do it together with sarah delay this is typical a work problem 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.619
 team up 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.089
 and now it is the logical thing is that if a law both wild 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.560
 then when the board is going to be less than logically hours 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.220
 music and recession peccata accepted no reason can be achieved 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.860
 what is the formula for teamwork 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.760
 this is the following 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 divided into times that dies points 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.470
 It does not matter 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.630
 ap 1 lived the time that the first object died that two hours 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 1 divided in time is that the second object dies 10 3 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.180
 this insurance and in the total time guti for that margin of the points is equal 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.040
 one would say time one 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.490
 plus one directed in time 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.950
 to make the famous team work formula 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.830
 2 one divided time is equality we add this minimum sixth pressure 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.830
 common at zero and 13 6 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.620
 this formula 3 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.000
 62 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.650
 by a voice 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.760
 two of the parking lots one shed is equal so costs 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 finally all this is achieved but one 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 this oil montero one 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850
 the 0-1 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.880
 and it is high but one what it does 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.870
 change agreed to turn the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.040
 the fraction one departed before girolamo tell us what would make fun 1 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.050
 that's why one is going to propose 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 A car is afraid, the entourage turns around 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.110
 already then of the time you emulate this fifth point 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.380
 and if only dÃ­dimo to second division 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.780
 followed without september cordoba according to or as to the spurs 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.390
 the celtics sure one like two to be born in vinegar 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.669
 both of the sector are already 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.679
 the tenacity of
