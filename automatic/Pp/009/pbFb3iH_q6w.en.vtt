question for you comparing three

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.019 
question for you comparing three
different<00:00:15.690> flagships<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.590> g3<00:00:17.070> from<00:00:17.279> LG<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
different flagships the g3 from LG the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.130 
different flagships the g3 from LG the
s5<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.930> Samsung<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> One<00:00:20.789> m8<00:00:20.970> from<00:00:21.630> HTC

s5 from Samsung and the One m8 from HTC

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.950 
s5 from Samsung and the One m8 from HTC
now<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> didn't<00:00:23.400> know<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> did<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.420> battery

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
now if you didn't know I did do battery

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
now if you didn't know I did do battery
drain<00:00:25.320> test<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.279> played<00:00:26.849> youtube<00:00:27.359> videos

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
drain test or I played youtube videos

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.109 
drain test or I played youtube videos
until<00:00:28.199> each<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.619> these<00:00:28.740> phones<00:00:29.010> died<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
until each of these phones died and I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.209 
until each of these phones died and I
put<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.510> time-lapse<00:00:30.840> form<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.070> I've<00:00:32.130> done

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
put it in time-lapse form so I've done

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130 
put it in time-lapse form so I've done
that<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.430> all<00:00:32.700> three<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.090> these<00:00:33.239> devices<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that for all three of these devices you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
that for all three of these devices you
can<00:00:34.260> watch<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> individual<00:00:35.190> video<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
can watch the individual video if you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
can watch the individual video if you
want<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> check<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
want to if you want to check out the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
want to if you want to check out the
specifics<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.640> don't<00:00:38.790> believe<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:39.210> maybe

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
specifics if you don't believe me maybe

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.900 
specifics if you don't believe me maybe
all<00:00:39.899> those<00:00:40.290> link<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> description<00:00:41.489> but

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
all those link in the description but

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.220 
all those link in the description but
basically<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> compare

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
basically I'm just going to compare

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.500 
basically I'm just going to compare
those<00:00:43.559> three<00:00:43.920> tests<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
those three tests you can see which of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
those three tests you can see which of
these<00:00:45.750> phones<00:00:46.079> has<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> longest<00:00:46.829> battery

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
these phones has the longest battery

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
these phones has the longest battery
life<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.489> these<00:00:47.940> tests<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:49.050> aren't

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
life in these tests these aren't

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
life in these tests these aren't
necessarily<00:00:49.399> real-world<00:00:50.399> usage<00:00:50.879> they're

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
necessarily real-world usage they're

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.709 
necessarily real-world usage they're
very<00:00:51.960> extreme<00:00:52.500> tests<00:00:52.800> well<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.879> idea

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
very extreme tests well this is an idea

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
very extreme tests well this is an idea
of<00:00:54.960> how<00:00:55.260> each<00:00:55.530> device<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.250> perform<00:00:56.610> if

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
of how each device will perform if

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.660 
of how each device will perform if
you're<00:00:57.420> putting<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> through<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.500> rigorous

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
you're putting it through very rigorous

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:10.270 
you're putting it through very rigorous
tests

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:23.750 

you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:38.230 

you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.600 

so<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.330> can<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.540> by<00:01:39.690> this<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.320> s5<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> g3

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so you can see by this the s5 and the g3

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.130 
so you can see by this the s5 and the g3
finished<00:01:42.060> very<00:01:42.240> similar<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.930> eight

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
finished very similar about eight

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.160 
finished very similar about eight
minutes<00:01:43.320> apart<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.490> real-world<00:01:44.910> usage<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.660> g3

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
minutes apart in real-world usage the g3

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
minutes apart in real-world usage the g3
is<00:01:46.320> better<00:01:46.590> than<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.830> s5<00:01:47.220> though<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.550> my

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
is better than the s5 though in my

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
is better than the s5 though in my
testing<00:01:48.120> however<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.990> m8<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.890> destroyed

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
testing however the m8 really destroyed

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880 
testing however the m8 really destroyed
all<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.790> these<00:01:50.940> phones<00:01:51.300> in<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.260> battery

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
all of these phones in this battery

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.859 
all of these phones in this battery
drain<00:01:53.220> test<00:01:53.460> getting<00:01:53.790> seven<00:01:54.270> hours<00:01:54.600> over<00:01:54.780> an

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
drain test getting seven hours over an

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.320 
drain test getting seven hours over an
hour<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> half<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.590> than<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.860> other<00:01:56.009> two

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
hour and a half more than the other two

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.670 
hour and a half more than the other two
which<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.479> probably<00:01:57.780> true<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.080> real<00:01:58.320> life<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
which is probably true in real life it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770 
which is probably true in real life it
probably<00:01:58.950> does<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> best<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.390> g3

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
probably does get the best and the g3

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
probably does get the best and the g3
then<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.050> s5<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.950> three<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.280> these

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
then the s5 but all three of these

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
then the s5 but all three of these
devices<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.910> great<00:02:03.210> battery<00:02:03.450> life<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
devices have great battery life you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
devices have great battery life you
really<00:02:04.200> shouldn't<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.440> problems<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
really shouldn't have problems but the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.300 
really shouldn't have problems but the
results<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.630> real-world<00:02:07.590> usage<00:02:07.979> would

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
results in my real-world usage would

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
results in my real-world usage would
probably<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> m8<00:02:09.330> G<00:02:09.959> 3<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> s5

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
probably be the m8 G 3 and then the s5

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.610 
probably be the m8 G 3 and then the s5
so<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.239> guys<00:02:12.360> did<00:02:12.690> enjoy<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.230> video<00:02:13.410> make
