our defensive line we think that's one
of<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> strengths<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.170> our<00:00:19.320> program<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.340> then

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
of the strengths of our program and then

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.580

however it is still early in camp first
couple<00:00:46.350> days<00:00:46.379> were<00:00:46.710> good<00:00:46.920> when<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
couple days were good when it was a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
couple days were good when it was a
review<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.300> spring<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.960> now<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.289> we're

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
review from spring but now that we're

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.369 
review from spring but now that we're
sticking<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.920> some<00:00:50.100> new<00:00:50.510> concepts<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
sticking in some new concepts there is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
sticking in some new concepts there is
some<00:00:52.649> laps<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.420> coverage<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.660> assignments<00:00:55.289> we

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
some laps of coverage and assignments we

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
some laps of coverage and assignments we
got<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.829> back<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.760> at

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
got to get back to that but I think at

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
got to get back to that but I think at
this<00:00:57.239> point<00:00:57.360> we're<00:00:58.289> feeling<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:59.070> we

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this point we're feeling really good we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.599 
this point we're feeling really good we
stayed<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.609> relatively<00:01:00.570> healthy<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.609> we

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
stayed up relatively healthy and we

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
stayed up relatively healthy and we
think<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> Pearl<00:01:03.780> Harbor<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
think when we get to Pearl Harbor and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
think when we get to Pearl Harbor and
going<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.519> game<00:01:05.640> we'll<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.450> our

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
going in that first game we'll have our

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.500

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600 
pains with the transition of a new
offense<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:59.070> pressure<00:01:59.310> for

the<00:01:59.700> defense<00:02:00.170> well<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the defense well I think the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.459 
the defense well I think the
expectations<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> whole<00:02:03.719> program<00:02:04.020> i

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
expectations of the whole program i

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.130 
expectations of the whole program i
think<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> putting<00:02:05.850> guys<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.899> edge

think is putting guys you know on edge
and<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> sense<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> everybody's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and a sense of everybody's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
defensive side of the ball well I think

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.700 
defensive side of the ball well I think
our<00:02:41.330> philosophy<00:02:42.330> again<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.810> about<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> ball

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
our philosophy again is about the ball

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.380 
our philosophy again is about the ball
we're<00:02:44.130> gonna<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.490> create<00:02:44.760> turnovers

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
we're gonna have to create turnovers

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.699 
we're gonna have to create turnovers
we're<00:02:45.570> gonna<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> give<00:02:46.080> our<00:02:46.260> office<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
we're gonna have to give our office a

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.360 
we're gonna have to give our office a
shorter<00:02:47.400> field<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:48.000> much<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.530> we're

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
shorter field as much as we can to we're

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.800 
shorter field as much as we can to we're
gonna<00:02:50.550> have<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.970> limit<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.480> amount<00:02:51.570> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
gonna have to limit the amount of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.810 
gonna have to limit the amount of
explosives<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.950> we<00:02:53.100> give<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.730> I'm

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
explosives that we give up and I'm

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.160 
explosives that we give up and I'm
talking<00:02:54.000> about<00:02:54.180> whether<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.690> deep<00:02:54.900> pass

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
talking about whether it's a deep pass

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.370 
talking about whether it's a deep pass
or<00:02:55.560> whether<00:02:55.770> it's<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.070> big<00:02:56.550> long<00:02:56.850> run<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:58.110> got<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
or whether it's a big long run we got to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.290 
or whether it's a big long run we got to
eliminate<00:02:58.740> those<00:02:58.860> big<00:02:59.220> chunks<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.790> yardage

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
eliminate those big chunks of yardage

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.900 
eliminate those big chunks of yardage
and<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.410> third<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:02.040> we're<00:03:02.820> gonna

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and and I think third is we're gonna

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.550 
and and I think third is we're gonna
have<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.270> very<00:03:03.450> efficient<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.080> third<00:03:04.320> down

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
have to be very efficient on third down

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.650 
have to be very efficient on third down
we're<00:03:05.459> gonna<00:03:05.550> have<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.910> make<00:03:06.090> sure<00:03:06.300> we<00:03:06.480> get

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
we're gonna have to make sure we get

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.750 
we're gonna have to make sure we get
them<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.020> situation<00:03:07.200> words<00:03:07.890> advantage<00:03:08.580> to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
them in a situation words advantage to

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.150 
them in a situation words advantage to
the<00:03:08.850> defense<00:03:09.300> in<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.170> down<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.530> distance<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the defense in the down and distance and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.310 
the defense in the down and distance and
then<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.940> able<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.330> off<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.600> field<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:13.170> get

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
then be able to get off the field or get

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.920 
then be able to get off the field or get

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
a turnover to get our office the ball
