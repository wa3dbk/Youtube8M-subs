00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.480
 so fix up ask how much it 23 7 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.950
 she played too much computer that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.360
 he has quite negative effects on human beings 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.950
 I found that out because of that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.660
 I myself busy and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.370
 why this game is so awful that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 I explain to you now in this video 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.720
 Christin also you should less so 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.279
 time to spend the christin man 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 I do not want to step anymore if that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.869
 victim is already on the ground when the am 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 ground-lying victims but in 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.619
 military uniforms around and blasts with 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.649
 explosions and obscenities around 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 Throwing just does not want to give up then 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.260
 Maybe you just have to go 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 help a little bit 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.629
 call of duty there was a time there 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 I loved you it was the year 2003 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.770
 and I was too young for that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 which of course to play 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 led directly to that I played you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 what you me on the pc screen 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.370
 magic is that I've never had 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.530
 seen 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 I was not a supersoldier or victory 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 defeat, however, not alone from me 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.309
 off I was just a tiny gear in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.290
 a huge war motor that he out 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.650
 provided driven by fighting 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.080
 has been 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 Once upon a time, today I am balling myself as 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 Supporter of American freedom 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 and a man army through yours 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 stories and shook only with 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 my ideas are coming out of my head and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.119
 what do you do when you run out of ideas 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.670
 you are brutal and cruel in modern 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.080
 Warfare 2 established a story for 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 the self the time on the spot 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
 ears are standing on a desk 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.900
 would open with a 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 despicable mission in the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.110
 I join a Russian commando 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.060
 may look like it on one as well 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 Russian airport hundreds of civilians 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.000
 butcher and if I want to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 even with ball on 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 hurray and why do I have to do that? 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.970
 play an american cia agent 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.259
 who as a spy in an acoustic 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.570
 underground organization and the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.070
 At the end of the main villain Makarov in the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 the Russian is shot 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.149
 will see that a dead cia agent 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.100
 Lying on the airport is on the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.909
 just hundreds of civilians shot 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.820
 and the only logical conclusion 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.280
 it is clear na america attack 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.830
 and the fucking third world war too 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.310
 start watts makes that the russians 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.709
 Not 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.890
 how skeptical that the cia agent with 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.690
 a ball in the head should be dead there 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.640
 shot his own series colleagues 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.560
 after they have themselves for any reason 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 reason decided zig russian 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.590
 kill civilians and why 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 no one notices that on the dozens 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.390
 Security cameras everywhere in the world 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.730
 well-known Russian criminal Makarov 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.200
 is on the road and then you surrender 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.269
 completely and also gives me the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.450
 Just allow the whole mission 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.170
 skip it is so irrelevant the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.120
 given motivation for the war is like that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.370
 incredibly stupid that you completely 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 just say who can jump over it 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.640
 if I can jump over it and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440
 do not miss anything 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.569
 then maybe that should be a small one 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.660
 sign that this mission 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.160
 but not in this game belongs but 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.709
 she had to be there because you 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.810
 finally shock with the 85th 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.160
 litter the series you can the press 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.750
 not really hot anymore 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.239
 so have to be playful as well 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.329
 narrative completely useless civilians 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.430
 Massacre or dead children are 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.530
 always totally practically no market dead 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.540
 I care for children every time he dies 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.910
 children thinks his conclusion was 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.160
 clear modern warfare 3 needs dead 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.290
 children so you cut for any 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.630
 completely incoherent to a mission 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.760
 a happy family and shows how 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.780
 you from an explosion in a thousand 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.420
 pieces is torn 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.100
 Oh well, I'm shocked there 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.859
 daring modern warfare 3 yes times 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.660
 really what it dares to manipulate 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.340
 boring and predictable 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.389
 a series of attractive with those 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.400
 now a complete series 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.650
 can be described and as if that were 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.239
 not enough that you too 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.400
 still in American patriotism 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.989
 Michael Bay is probably proud of 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.470
 he burst the end of black ops 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.170
 With her own eyes, America saw fuck yeah 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.150
 No thanks I do not expect you to me 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.769
 narrative quality and moral 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.810
 telling challenging stories 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.639
 dear call of duty I expect 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.130
 just that you consider me as a potential 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.049
 Do not shop for a borderline red 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.959
 Neckar is short on every explosion 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.530
 before orgasm stands and less dead 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.299
 children 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.159
 they may be nice, too 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.289
 that is a bit easy and done 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:24.060
 Call of duty I admit 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.979
 so on-site norm so far easier 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.419
 and is excited about final fantasy 13 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.490
 order and against it comes directly to her 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.229
 to the next episode or you look 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.610
 the new one is due to ios at 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.610
 there 's a lot of fun there
