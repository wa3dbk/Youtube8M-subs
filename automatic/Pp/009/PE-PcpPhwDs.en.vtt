00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello again to all my subscribers 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.060
 of the commercial channel and I'm 1086 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.450
 nothing goodbye I bring some boxing in this 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.519
 case it's about tacuary 4.5 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.490
 another one of the terminals of the family of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.980
 bq of the new range and is one of the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.990
 let's say low range so to speak or of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.310
 entry line and it is one of the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 terminals that until now had not 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.939
 we could prove we had the 4 l 5 l 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 5 fhd and this was one of those that were missing 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 for trying so nothing I will do a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.030
 boxing so you can see what it is and what 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.130
 is what it brings as you can see it is already 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.719
 represented as has been assigned because 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 it was open so nothing like 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.910
 has received I have decided to do that with 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.160
 you and well let's see here you can 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.809
 see the phone also comes with dual 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.780
 8 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 quad-core processor 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 and 400 as gpu supports microsd cards 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 2 thousand 150 thousand battery pawns camera 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.110
 8 - megapixel rear camera and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.710
 front of 5 bluetooth etc and the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.799
 resolution is not hd is I think it was a 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.190
 980 x 480 worth without like the one that had the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.320
 first bq to 45 and we will not see how 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.320
 is to open it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.510
 haha comes pretty well put and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.010
 good we have what is the phone 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.900
 the truth that aesthetically goes through 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.540
 new I do not know if they have only opened it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.590
 to prove it what if I can observe 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590
 that not all plastics 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.850
 here we have what is typical 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.549
 What is it 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.290
 the cable the power adapter that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.800
 national tender is present 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.280
 and what brings all have come the range 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.820
 previous 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.830
 the microusb cable for the pc and for the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.640
 load so let's tell them what 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.100
 is the phone here we have it from the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.330
 plastics and in here inside money that 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 is the instruction manual and I 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.580
 I imagine that the pinchitos to be able 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.130
 extract the cards jon this phone 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.729
 has a series of differences with 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.320
 respect for example to bq a quart and g4 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.350
 which is the last one we saw how we can 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.990
 see this one can not extract a part 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.459
 of the battery the difference 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.940
 has this let's say you have the chassis 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.860
 unibody as the model is 5 and 6 and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.500
 good aesthetically characteristics 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.360
 they are the same we can see in the part 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.280
 Rear the 8 megapixel camera with 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.470
 The double flash led speakers 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.239
 they would be down here with the system this 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.209
 double integrated that sounds pretty good 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.830
 here the microusb connector on the side 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.180
 right the blocking lock button 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.300
 powerful screen up and down 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.210
 volume on the top we have 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.980
 the entrance for the headphones the gap 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.560
 for the microsd cards that are here 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.650
 and on the left we would have 2 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.810
 pinchitos for the two sim cards that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.180
 in this case they are micro sim what 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.860
 differences has with respect to 4 per 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.680
 example, because it has a little bit more 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.890
 screen and that is no longer removable and 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.570
 remember that in l 4 the card 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.580
 memory was inside you could open and 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.890
 extract it and here it is just as bad 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.980
 put and is so inaccessible so 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.180
 say it as it happened in l 5 h of what 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.590
 that does give me the feeling that the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.120
 screen I think it comes with the same 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
 crystal the dragon like but I'm not given 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.560
 feeling that it's even cleaner 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.130
 let's do the handkerchief test 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.130
 it never fails 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.079
 handkerchiefs of the market not of 80 cents 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.629
 better than there is and good as you can see 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.180
 this is what most attracts attention 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.829
 crystal cleans up super well despite 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.120
 it's the same crystal that supposedly 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.489
 It is the model of 5 and the s is already 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.109
 I told you that it was quite a barrier and 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.540
 it gets dirty just to combine them 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.069
 so nothing this would be all I hope that 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.170
 I liked it and nothing soon 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.459
 review and experience with him a greeting 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.459
 we'll see you all later
