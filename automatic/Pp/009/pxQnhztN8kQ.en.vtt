00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.330
 hello dear minecraft layer and sincerely 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.760
 welcome now in my backplane 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.650
 tutorial here on the 107th 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.590
 Today it's about the wonderful 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.880
 hide and seek plugin escapes today 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.430
 maybe you should be big 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.930
 Servern as for example live and before the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.700
 intro you already have some games 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.770
 seen excerpts and that is in the reason 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.410
 hide and seek hide and seek 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.580
 In this video we show you as you 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.250
 you the plug-in on your server 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.500
 Installed and configured as the end 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.630
 also a rena in minecraft touch down 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.740
 could we wish you a lot of fun and 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 catch one with the same 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.210
 download on the cheek page around that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.369
 we use the plug-in to download 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.750
 download button on the cheek of the page 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.180
 bring again on download on file 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.509
 save and now we do not pull them 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.920
 enemy once in the plugins folder on 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.660
 our server 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.340
 if it's in there then we can 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.070
 the server also start again the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 console then runs through once and in 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.280
 plugins folder now has a new one 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.380
 folder you no enemy made in it 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.180
 we find an arena spot ml that can 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.979
 when open is currently still empty 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.869
 there is something else coming later 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.690
 there are still some points of contention for her and 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.670
 I'll explain that to you now, and indeed 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.679
 there are different things here 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.000
 can adjust for a foggy one 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.039
 that means if that whole thing at all 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.289
 turned on or he turned off 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.940
 should show that is a kind of prefix 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.910
 you can also change the position 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.580
 Again, that is the idea of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.289
 scoreboards as well auto loud you can 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 adjust something here update checker 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.560
 should the plug-in automatically after 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.420
 looking for updates then there are still 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.950
 settings for you if you want the chat 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.660
 want to change colors if you know 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.190
 want where you get the chat colors from 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.230
 then look at the video description 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 There you will also find a link to it 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.730
 you can tell me two more here 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.920
 rename and on the one hand the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.590
 message no missions and the other 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.900
 the message no command and that can 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.480
 you can rename it here then you can 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.580
 because the band id change that 's with 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.290
 which you will later select the arena 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.150
 her still in the game part as well 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 is there still a timer there you can 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.900
 set the lobby countdown how long 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.730
 lets take so long if enough players in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.010
 the lobby are up until the game starts and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.049
 so on and so forth so much to this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.909
 Attitudes now close us 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.690
 file again and more often the messages 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.400
 Points 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.710
 because we can all speak here 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.730
 rename the pack so rename 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.650
 or rewrite 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.960
 There are 11 more points 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.670
 melody is currently still empty the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.500
 only when we created an arena 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.720
 should have and how to make an arena 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.170
 we'll show you this in now 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.020
 game so here we are in the game and now 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.970
 with the command / gl we check times 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.130
 which plugins are currently installed 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.060
 below we see it also knows the enemy is 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.040
 Installed 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.980
 Now let's write in the charts 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.600
 is she can not find then get that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.780
 a little overview of the plugin 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.340
 As an abbreviation we can also use saf 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.900
 that is always the same way 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.540
 is a bit shorter than she knows 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.040
 enemy now we say it then runs 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.780
 we get that look and now 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.970
 we can choose our arena 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.040
 we actually choose it as with world 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.510
 hit out first we go into the one 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.880
 point of the arena in the fall on this 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.590
 glass tower here and make one 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.270
 left click then we fly over 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.460
 the other side and do it on the other side 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.050
 ground a right click and it was already 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.160
 the first and the second position 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.670
 selected 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.440
 Now we use the command / saf create 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.220
 under the arena took in the 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.410
 case test 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.900
 Now we got an arena with the name 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.390
 test now we have to create two more 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:10.660
 sports set bonn's lobbies on the one hand 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:12.850
 we do that with saf set pop and then 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.370
 lobby and behind it still test because the 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.350
 arena ja test means now we got one 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.600
 word test created now we need 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.010
 to spawn another arena or air arena 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.950
 where the created with / saf sap arena and 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.810
 behind it still test 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.660
 Now we have a word test for the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.610
 arena created now we use / sfz 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.350
 players and then the maximum number of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.669
 games to play on the arena 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.230
 in this case once 10 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.900
 and behind it again the arena 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.419
 So now we have to take the test 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.710
 minimal number of players put that 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.360
 we do with saf set and then 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.340
 players for the minimum number 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.080
 then we play there 2 1 that is 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.639
 namely, the minimum number and 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.099
 back there yet tested because that's the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.139
 Arina name is so now we can 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.180
 another one - a place for it 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.219
 Placed write me the top line 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.590
 sf capitalized in square brackets 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.180
 and then under the arm took 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.819
 just up and then we have 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.259
 a joint counts one can also a ran 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.300
 We can do that in the shield as well 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.430
 square brackets sf in the top line 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.520
 ran into the second line and into the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.740
 third line din arena took now 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.360
 we have a joint and one ran his 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.009
 we could go with mine now 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.389
 Right-click on the shield in the arena 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:34.360
 join or we use the comment / 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.319
 saf join and then the arena took in 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.419
 the case test 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.830
 but we use the shield once and 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.840
 Now we are here in the lobby and we 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.430
 need at least two players and 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.569
 Now we love the arena right away 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.210
 Again we do not have two games 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.770
 with the leaf sign as much to the arena 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.050
 configuration in the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.089
 configuration files in the plugins folder 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.439
 you have new things, so to speak 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.210
 you can stand again now 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.889
 set as you can, for example, the 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.360
 minimum players the maximum players 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.430
 still change if you want but 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.139
 otherwise it was the hide and seek 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.300
 plugin we hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.800
 and I thank you for watching says 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.089
 bye by the next video from 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.089
 my only 7
