00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.939
 hi in my life today we are going to learn 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.460
 to make the frank celu so typical of 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.230
 my land south of Spain as always 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 the products you will be able to find 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.009
 in my blog you do not want to lose any 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.009
 of my lives subscribe to my channel 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.180
 as a base we are going to use this shadow 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.180
 that we are going to apply all over the eyelid 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.410
 just above the crease of the eyelid 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.739
 let's apply this shadow in a tone 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.800
 topo and this one in an ocher tone 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.590
 eggplant on the mobile eyelid to give 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 depth to the look we are going to use 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.230
 this black shadow that we are going to apply 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.510
 only in the corner of the eyelid 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.660
 mobile and we extend it a little bit towards 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.489
 up afterwards we blur very well the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.620
 protagonists of this look are the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.140
 lips but how do you want to mark me the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.510
 look instead of using a black pencil 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.270
 I will use this other in an ocher tone 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 so he delineated my eyelashes so much 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.189
 superior purchases lower and both 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 water lines 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.720
 another option is to do it in black but 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.549
 decant jce for this color yo 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 I would recommend that then the lips 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.979
 take a little more discreet or with 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.720
 a red less risquÃ© a touch of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.450
 light under the eyebrows 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.659
 eyelash mask the more the better 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.119
 As you can see, the eyes are very marked 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 basically using the pencil and a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 shadow somewhat discreet in her face 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.940
 we will give importance to outline and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.640
 to illuminate 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.850
 with sun dust I'm going to sculpt 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.750
 the face below the temple cheekbone and 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.890
 jaw 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.470
 that is marked 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.440
 we illuminate the high cheekbone and blurs them 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.050
 with the tips of your fingers we add a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.840
 little bit of rouge to give a touch of 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.819
 color to our cheeks 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.040
 normally I usually do makeup and 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.020
 then I put the flowers on 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.120
 earrings etcetera remains 2 because 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.100
 end of the video you will be able to see but 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.069
 before we go with the lips the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.709
 protagonists of this look first I 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.930
 outline and fill the lips so that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.900
 fix the bar better and it lasts longer 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.380
 time and finally I paint them with the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.380
 Fixed bar 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.120
 I wear the earrings that are great 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.750
 and long and we finish with the flowers 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.290
 can put up on one side down 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.840
 with loose hair and so on fashion 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.110
 flamenco is very rich so it allows you 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 a wide range of good possibilities 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.580

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.440
