00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.120
 This is Endowed Chair nerve repositioning Laboratory of the School of Medicine 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:20.890
 In the nerve reduction study course, we grasp the pain of our familiar muscles by hand, homs manual therapy and thermal therapy 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:26.489
 Traditional medicine from ancient times such as Japan 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.489
 We are studying neurophysiologically 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:39.140
 not 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:41.450
 Urakawa's associate professor focused on the natural healing power inherent in ecology, such as the regeneration mechanism of the brain 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.290
 I am studying 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:53.680
 Until now, studies using animals have caused motor and compression stimuli from the surroundings 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.680
 Have revealed that it will bring about big changes 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 Manual therapy for the Itami climbed muscles 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 Kind of stimulus, or it is'll whether massaged lightly Well 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 Do you fry is done that by stimulation from the outside Well, such as Amaa went so cool thermal Well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.799
 How 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.799
 Well who is trying to turn that mechanism 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:24.670
 Currently Hula he is Associate Professor squeeze the pain of the same muscle with humans for subsequent muscle given experimentally in animal 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.409
 Add stimulation 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 And we are observing the change of brain by pain chemically 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:44.950
 After all the brain is doing what the final judgment of that pain is 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:50.560
 What we are focusing on is a strange lighthouse, and from the outside world, for example, 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.210
 Well , it turns out that the custody of the amygdala seems to smell even when you add something 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.020
 Cake focusing on the head stand and the place 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 This is where you are 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:11.360
 Who Koichi Kamoto Assistant Professor of here also to ease the pain of muscle 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:17.130
 How does Tosh compression stimulation, thermal and electrical stimulation etc. change to brain activity and autonomic nervous activity 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:23.690
 As claiming the subject we are a non-invasive study 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.690
 And we are elucidating both of these analgesic mechanisms 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:38.540
 Currently we use a device called Nils that records changes in blood flow due to brain activity. 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:43.180
 Measure blood flow changes in the brain by manual therapy or hyperthermia 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.180
 I am working on the elucidation of analgesia mechanism 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.569
 When the thermal sheet is attached to the warning section 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:01.490
 Activity of the prefrontal cortex is low 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:10.210
 The prefrontal area is the site that responds to the eyes and stress you have made 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:10.210
 Therefore, this mechanism has been shown to be effective for hyperthermia 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:23.430
 Accumulation of scientific evidence for therapeutic effects in the course of neural reduction 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.260
 As we examine the traditional medicine by Judo scientifically by still elucidation of treatment mechanism 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.010
 School of Medicine 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.190
 City Jyo-ji says in the system how to science 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.000
 According to the survey of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.480
 Very many people complain of musculoskeletal bitterness 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.030
 Especially in the elderly people 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.780
 There are characteristic 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.180
 So say I this gold country 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.250
 the weird and true 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.530
 With big problem for welfare improvement of the nation 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:06.240
 We now have 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:06.240
 I hope that the research of this course can contribute to solving such problems as much as possible. 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:21.140
 Our future research target of nerve reduction study course Urakawa Associate Professor is muscle pain in our neighborhood 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.140
 It is to try to elucidate the effect of treatment on this 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:33.180
 And the research goal of Assistant Professor Takamoto 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.180
 My goal is to establish Judo reduction as integrated medicine
