00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.220
 hello good to all as well as before people 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.290
 this video is going to come to us all very 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.540
 well because we're going to see in it all the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.410
 advantages all exo zombies perches 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.030
 and how can we lose the fixes we're going to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 start for example by exxon doctor 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.040
 it would be the same as saying which revive and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 what is good because that drink 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 the rival week we already know that the zombies 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.519
 of stars was to be able to revive us 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 ourselves not if we play in 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.530
 individual and cooperative to revive 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.199
 to the partner as quickly as possible 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.390
 Well, in this case, it 's exactly what 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.210
 only that instead of disappearing the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 drink because it is the machine that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 it soon goes out and we can no longer take 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 the most after having done it three 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.260
 Sometimes it's okay but what happens in a cooperative? 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.119
 in cooperative that is the same 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.580
 exactly the same 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.860
 the partner revives you and takes two 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.890
 seconds in reliving you quickly mind 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.110
 then health would come sex or ex or 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.810
 health that would be the same as saying the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 quote or you see us in broth 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 Look Granger zombies this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.940
 it's exactly the same without honey 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.450
 two touches and the third you fall to the ground 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.930
 but with him when you take it when you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.410
 you put the health of exo you would endure four 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 touches and the fifth you would fall this would be the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.940
 exo health or exo health now 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 we would have the exo jump that would be like 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.740
 say the flop er in star zombies 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.550
 but less potent and has no immunity 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.570
 of the explosives takes 10 seconds in 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.940
 reload the exo jumped then you jump 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.300
 let's say the kick is towards the ground and 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.220
 when it goes off it takes 10 seconds in 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
 recharge again and turn color 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.350
 blue and then you can already 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.970
 use it again and for what I have 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.090
 said of what he does not have immunity from 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.080
 the explosives means there are two 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.360
 weapons that can hurt you that are 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.120
 the crossbow and the margin that is as if 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.519
 outside the rocket launcher that those two 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 weapons hurt you and you can get to 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.610
 kill you that would be the nexus jump now you 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.830
 I would touch the sale 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.230
 of the ex - soldier gives you the advantage of 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.900
 overwhelming and hardness what does this mean 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.060
 because it has less recoil at the time 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.480
 to shoot and that does not stop pointing 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.370
 even if you run that you're running and not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.260
 you aim with the peephole but you do not have it 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 commissioning waist always prepared 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.090
 prepared the weapon in case you have to 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.990
 shoot and set aside then that's not what 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.220
 I just said that the regression 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.310
 decreases does not have as much recoil 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.980
 although you do not notice a very exaggerated thing 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.450
 but if he says it and he has that if he has that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 advantage 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.090
 now it would be the recharge exo that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.709
 means exo recharge because it's the same 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.700
 what to say in zombies of stars 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.400
 rapid recharge or prestidigitation 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.810
 refills the gun much faster when 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.090
 you take when you wear this this 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 expoventa this is the condition that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.769
 I would have this dog in recharge much more 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.750
 fast now comes the most important thing of 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.269
 all how are we going to lose those advantages 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.970
 when we are cooperative 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.760
 our partner has 30 seconds to 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.620
 can revive us and in those 30 seconds 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.319
 we can get to lose nothing more and nothing 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.410
 less than three advantages at nine 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.160
 seconds counting from 30 backwards 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.160
 until 0 at nine seconds we go to 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.799
 lose the first and every nine seconds 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.579
 following we're going to lose the second and 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.769
 the third until when we have a 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.840
 second although our partner we 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.360
 have revived we are going to lose three 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.280
 advantages what does it mean because if 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.440
 we have all the advantages 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.889
 we have to take first two 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.920
 most important advantages of all because 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.350
 the rest as we go 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.030
 throwing to the ground not agreeing 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.970
 hoping that our partner does not 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.320
 revive we are going to lose that is 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.660
 very important and I want you to stay 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.010
 clear well, good people, here you would have 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.810
 all the advantages all the hangers their 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.150
 conditions the condition of each and 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.370
 the way we would have to lose a 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.560
 I hope that it helps you and pulls 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.180
 to kill a lot of sex zombies relax 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.180
 subscribe and until the next video
