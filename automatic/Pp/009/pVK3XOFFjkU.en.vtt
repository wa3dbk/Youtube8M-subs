what's called a sidearm on the side of
their<00:00:38.530> water<00:00:38.890> heater<00:00:39.280> that<00:00:39.580> actually<00:00:40.450> has<00:00:40.630> the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
water from the outdoor furnace popped

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.380 
water from the outdoor furnace popped
into<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.330> and<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:44.440> water<00:00:44.920> goes<00:00:45.250> through<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
into it and the water goes through and

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.990 
into it and the water goes through and
it<00:00:46.750> heats<00:00:46.930> up<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.379> water<00:00:47.830> in<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.400> tube<00:00:48.730> that

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
it heats up the water in a tube that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
it heats up the water in a tube that
gets<00:00:49.270> recirculated<00:00:49.840> in<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.620> water<00:00:50.860> heater<00:00:51.570> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
gets recirculated in the water heater I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.070 
gets recirculated in the water heater I
calculated<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:54.070> length<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.850> 42<00:00:55.449> inch<00:00:55.480> one

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
calculated the length of a 42 inch one

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.130 
calculated the length of a 42 inch one
that<00:00:56.710> had<00:00:56.890> three<00:00:57.159> quarter<00:00:57.580> inch<00:00:57.790> tubing<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.540> I

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
that had three quarter inch tubing and I

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.189 
that had three quarter inch tubing and I
substituted<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.190> with<00:01:00.220> 3h<00:01:00.850> tube<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:01.989> have

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
substituted it with 3h tube and I have

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.210 
substituted it with 3h tube and I have
seven<00:01:02.739> 3/8<00:01:03.250> tubes<00:01:03.640> inside<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.590> water<00:01:05.590> jacket

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
seven 3/8 tubes inside this water jacket

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.660 
seven 3/8 tubes inside this water jacket
here<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:07.060> has<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.450> same<00:01:07.659> surface<00:01:08.050> as<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.670> 42

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
here that has the same surface as the 42

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.940 
here that has the same surface as the 42
inch<00:01:09.909> one<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.900> can<00:01:11.140> build<00:01:11.320> this<00:01:11.590> less

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
inch one we can build this less

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.580 
inch one we can build this less
expensive<00:01:12.610> than<00:01:12.760> the<00:01:12.940> 42<00:01:13.479> inch<00:01:13.690> one<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.110> it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
expensive than the 42 inch one and it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.830 
expensive than the 42 inch one and it
does<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.010> same<00:01:15.220> thing<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:16.210> recovers<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
does the same thing it recovers the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.399 
does the same thing it recovers the
water<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.710> your<00:01:18.040> water<00:01:18.310> heater<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.780> the
