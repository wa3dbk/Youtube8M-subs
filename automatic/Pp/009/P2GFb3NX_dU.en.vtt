see<00:00:32.379> him<00:00:32.500> being<00:00:32.529> higher<00:00:33.370> than<00:00:33.579> 90<00:00:33.969> maybe<00:00:34.719> 91

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
see him being higher than 90 maybe 91

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.779 
see him being higher than 90 maybe 91
but<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.559> don't<00:00:35.800> think<00:00:36.039> he<00:00:36.160> should<00:00:36.190> be<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.670> know

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
but I don't think he should be you know

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.420 
but I don't think he should be you know
he's<00:00:36.969> still<00:00:37.000> he's<00:00:37.750> he's<00:00:38.559> still<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.860> fantastic

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
he's still he's he's still a fantastic

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.860 
he's still he's he's still a fantastic
player<00:00:39.610> but<00:00:39.789> he's<00:00:39.879> not<00:00:40.030> as<00:00:40.149> complete<00:00:40.450> as<00:00:40.719> some

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
player but he's not as complete as some

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.389 
player but he's not as complete as some
of<00:00:40.989> these<00:00:41.050> other<00:00:41.260> players<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.680> are<00:00:41.860> on<00:00:42.070> and

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
of these other players that are on and

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.310 
of these other players that are on and
obviously<00:00:42.850> some<00:00:43.149> of<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> notoriously<00:00:43.930> rated

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320

high over the last couple years in PES
so<00:00:46.120> I'm<00:00:46.180> putting<00:00:46.390> him<00:00:46.510> at<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.600> 90<00:00:46.960> it's<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.140> big

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
so I'm putting him at a 90 it's a big

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.010 
so I'm putting him at a 90 it's a big
jump<00:00:47.530> up<00:00:47.770> from<00:00:47.800> 87<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:49.239> Paul<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.840> Beast

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020

essay<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.570> he's<00:01:05.140> been<00:01:05.379> over<00:01:06.009> 90<00:01:06.430> for<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.700> last

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
essay in he's been over 90 for the last

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.590 
essay in he's been over 90 for the last
five<00:01:07.090> games<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:08.310> he's<00:01:09.310> been<00:01:09.460> over<00:01:09.579> 95<00:01:10.180> for<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
five games and he's been over 95 for the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440 
five games and he's been over 95 for the
last<00:01:10.780> four<00:01:11.020> games<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.969> he<00:01:12.969> is<00:01:13.060> one<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.360> most

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
last four games so he is one of the most

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.940 
last four games so he is one of the most
complete<00:01:13.780> central<00:01:14.259> midfielders<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
complete central midfielders in the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.230 
complete central midfielders in the
world<00:01:15.130> he's<00:01:15.280> probably<00:01:15.520> more<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.789> an<00:01:15.939> attacking

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
world he's probably more of an attacking

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.090 
world he's probably more of an attacking
midfielder<00:01:16.420> but<00:01:17.020> i<00:01:17.229> still<00:01:17.679> think<00:01:17.889> an

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
midfielder but i still think an

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.859 
midfielder but i still think an
attacking<00:01:18.459> midfield<00:01:18.939> isn't<00:01:19.420> really<00:01:19.689> his

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
attacking midfield isn't really his

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.080 
attacking midfield isn't really his
position<00:01:20.409> for<00:01:20.590> where<00:01:21.490> he<00:01:21.549> plays<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.850> paris

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
position for where he plays the paris

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.760 
position for where he plays the paris
it's<00:01:22.270> hard<00:01:22.450> just<00:01:22.749> to<00:01:22.869> interlinks<00:01:23.350> but<00:01:23.499> he's<00:01:23.619> in

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
it's hard just to interlinks but he's in

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.889 
it's hard just to interlinks but he's in
number<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:24.130> anyway<00:01:24.429> up<00:01:24.999> next<00:01:25.359> is<00:01:25.450> our<00:01:25.539> tour<00:01:25.780> of

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
number for anyway up next is our tour of

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.660 
number for anyway up next is our tour of
a<00:01:25.990> dal<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.409> think<00:01:26.709> Fidel<00:01:26.950> would<00:01:27.130> be<00:01:27.249> the<00:01:27.369> highest

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
a dal I think Fidel would be the highest

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.179 
a dal I think Fidel would be the highest
rated<00:01:28.090> central<00:01:28.959> midfielder<00:01:29.409> in<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.740> game<00:01:29.950> and

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
rated central midfielder in the game and

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.059 
rated central midfielder in the game and
on<00:01:31.090> equal<00:01:31.869> power<00:01:32.079> with<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.529> top<00:01:32.740> one<00:01:32.950> that

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
on equal power with the top one that

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.219 
on equal power with the top one that
I've<00:01:33.159> chosen<00:01:33.459> here<00:01:33.880> if<00:01:34.060> he<00:01:34.600> moves<00:01:34.779> matches

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
I've chosen here if he moves matches

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.080 
I've chosen here if he moves matches
United<00:01:35.619> which<00:01:35.799> I'm<00:01:36.100> hoping<00:01:36.369> that<00:01:36.609> he<00:01:36.759> does<00:01:36.909> as

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
United which I'm hoping that he does as

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.429 
United which I'm hoping that he does as
the<00:01:37.149> United<00:01:37.450> fan<00:01:37.630> because<00:01:37.779> I<00:01:37.899> think<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.350> he

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
the United fan because I think that he

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.899 
the United fan because I think that he
could<00:01:38.619> he<00:01:39.130> go<00:01:39.249> get<00:01:39.429> Champions<00:01:39.819> League

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
could he go get Champions League

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.999 
could he go get Champions League
football<00:01:40.090> definitely<00:01:40.749> one<00:01:41.560> or<00:01:41.679> two<00:01:41.829> more

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
football definitely one or two more

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.039 
football definitely one or two more
additions<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.639> Van<00:01:42.789> Persie<00:01:42.819> beeston<00:01:43.599> I'll
