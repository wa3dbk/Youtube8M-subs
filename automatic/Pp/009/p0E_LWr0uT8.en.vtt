whole concept is you're going to tell
the<00:00:32.610> elevator<00:00:33.000> where<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.870> want<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.230> before

the elevator where you want to go before
you<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:34.829> inside<00:00:35.130> okay<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.570> by<00:00:36.719> doing<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you get inside okay so by doing that the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.340 
you get inside okay so by doing that the
system<00:00:38.250> knows<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.969> there<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.510> person<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
system knows are there one person in the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.200 
system knows are there one person in the
lobby<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.980> there<00:00:41.129> ten<00:00:41.399> people<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:41.969> lobby

lobby are there ten people in the lobby

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.990 
lobby are there ten people in the lobby
do<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.660> need<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> send<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.200> card<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.489> end<00:00:44.700> for

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
do I need to send one card is end for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.630 
do I need to send one card is end for
cars<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> has<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.950> information

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
cars because it has that information

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360 
cars because it has that information
so<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.719> Schiller's<00:00:49.079> port<00:00:49.379> technology<00:00:50.070> it's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
so with Schiller's port technology it's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.590 
so with Schiller's port technology it's
the<00:00:50.910> third<00:00:51.270> generation<00:00:51.920> for<00:00:52.920> Schindler

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the third generation for Schindler

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
the third generation for Schindler
obviously<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> touch<00:00:55.469> screen<00:00:55.890> okay

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.049 
obviously it now is a touch screen okay
very<00:00:57.510> simple<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.109> use<00:00:58.160> any<00:00:59.160> floor<00:00:59.760> that's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

an existing building with a

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.149 
an existing building with a
modernization<00:03:54.060> could<00:03:55.049> also<00:03:55.170> pull<00:03:55.499> in<00:03:55.709> what's

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
modernization could also pull in what's

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.739 
modernization could also pull in what's
called<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.579> power<00:03:56.760> factor<00:03:56.999> driver<00:03:57.420> power

factor one drive

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.489

it's<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.549> regenerative<00:04:00.120> drive<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.230> what<00:04:01.409> it

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:01.499 
it's a regenerative drive so what it

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.679 
it's a regenerative drive so what it
actually<00:04:01.530> does<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.519> takes<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:03.329> energy

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
actually does is it takes the energy

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.720 
actually does is it takes the energy
usage<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.319> elevator<00:04:04.650> system<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.370> puts<00:04:05.639> it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
usage in the elevator system it puts it

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.429 
usage in the elevator system it puts it

about high-rises we always talk about
new<00:04:22.079> installation<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:23.190> if<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.400> a

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430

current<00:04:23.820> building<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.720> maybe<00:04:25.440> you're

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
current building and maybe you're

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.560 
current building and maybe you're
looking<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.099> upgrade<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.789> think<00:04:27.180> we<00:04:27.360> can

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
looking to upgrade I think we can

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.450 
looking to upgrade I think we can
actually<00:04:27.750> do<00:04:28.320> what<00:04:28.470> we<00:04:28.560> call<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.830> destination

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
actually do what we call a destination

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.300 
actually do what we call a destination
interface<00:04:30.210> okay<00:04:30.990> we<00:04:31.169> can<00:04:31.380> put<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:32.039> port

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
interface okay we can put the port

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.909 
interface okay we can put the port

talked a little bit about owners and you

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.969 
talked a little bit about owners and you

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
of the reasons that an architect might

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.180 
of the reasons that an architect might

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
specify the product it actually gives

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.430 
specify the product it actually gives

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
where you place the ports it's a little

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.080 
where you place the ports it's a little
