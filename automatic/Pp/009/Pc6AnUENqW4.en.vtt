00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.300
 hey you people it's diego how 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.440
 are you going to go me great but listen 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.909
 guys today we find ourselves for 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.739
 a new video 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.449
 but before starting my little 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.309
 commentary I would still ask 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.729
 the decor we find ourselves for a 40 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.809
 tons strict at cac40 and at the level of 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.939
 my class it was really like 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.979
 so usually I played at 4.40 cannon 

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:59.170
 long fast charge at the asset level 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.549
 it was really as usual 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.549
 so that is bulletproof vest 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.509
 billiard malaise and dexterity 1 6 4 a 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.830
 tactical insertion 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.819
 I also intend to warn you 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.380
 now a lot of people 

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:09.130
 may say yes the gameplay stinks the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.600
 why shit 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 and well just because I 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.649
 play the c4 stone but you'll see it I 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.289
 did not do a lot of kiel at c4 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.459
 there are well over 30 frags at the cac40 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.959
 so it's still a gameplay 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.159
 very very drinkable 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.799
 so when she did that I was 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.229
 also accompanied by morpheus and until 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.940
 it was a big dedication to 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.289
 them guys is also before 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.299
 to start communitarianism was to 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.890
 do a big astrapi dedications all 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.600
 guys his chain will be in the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.789
 description do not hesitate to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.950
 go see her finally guys 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.360
 so this video I'm trying to send it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.119
 to chains like the code qg potting soil 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.129
 side f and playin'tv a big thank you to them 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.599
 if he claude me then at this 

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.399
 comment ige a topic that I think 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.619
 could please a lot of people 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.489
 this fairy tale simply speak with 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.899
 you remakes 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.160
 so for those who do not know what is 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.319
 what a remake so I think especially 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.110
 remakes of maps that is to say that 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.000
 a call of duty take a map 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.759
 of an old call of duty but a small 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 little remastered so with deduced again 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.030
 short decor map 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.280
 it is redone in quotation marks 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.019
 better so that's the purpose of a remake 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.090
 it is that they wholesale they take a map 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.220
 which is already done but he modifies it a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.300
 little bit so today I was holding 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.250
 you talk about remakes 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.349
 so I really want to know your 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.360
 notice about the remakes so tell me 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.709
 for comment whether or not you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.409
 think remakes are good 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.060
 thing simply on call of duty 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.980
 so is simply me I'm going 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.120
 give you my opinion so me 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.799
 personally I do not want to lie to you 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.459
 but I like remakes but that 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.340
 depends on the times 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.900
 imagine the remake of favelas this on 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.180
 ghost is a it's a remake that I like 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.799
 well why because the madonna w 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.980
 two favelas was a map I loved 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:48.219
 believe that I like by cons we will say 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.719
 studio style remakes this is it 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.900
 a remake that I like but no more 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.329
 because there I did not like it 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.250
 really finally short so that's really 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.079
 it depends it depends on people 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.480
 depends on you whether or not who does the 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.010
 mode you like the maps in fact by 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.329
 example imagine voice over the next 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.579
 symposium I wish I had a remake 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.989
 of style of raids or stand-up because 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.780
 that these are maps that I appreciate 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.129
 a lot of guys so that's it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.230
 really depends on both types of 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.629
 people whether people or just 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.040
 do not like or like these different 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.840
 tables so I would really like to know 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.010
 your opinion by comments do not hesitate 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.829
 really not to tell me 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.120
 that would interest me so here are the 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.669
 guy now I'm just going 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.950
 you talk a little bit about the gameplay 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.780
 so you see I'm playing at 40 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.909
 as I say and heading 48 and 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.379
 last gun you unlock and 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.980
 frankly it's a gun that is 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.019
 dark draws not bad abuse very simple to 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.669
 use the skin passage I'm in 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.290
 ruthless you will see that the nuclear 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.639
 is not very very fast but it remains 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.829
 a clear enough drinking 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.780
 so frankly if you too you 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.489
 want to try nuclear at 40 cac 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.530
 I have some tips to give you 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.000
 so especially already was waiting to have the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.500
 fast charger before starting your 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.659
 series or rather your attempt 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.459
 nuclear since the fast charger is 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.750
 really very very very helpful 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.189
 secondly try to come across 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.049
 maps or you know that you can have 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.479
 fighting in melee so 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.829
 especially there it was a map and leads that 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.209
 is a map where there is not necessarily 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.220
 melee combat but not 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.859
 necessarily very very long distances 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.209
 so that can pass frankly yemen I 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.470
 never realized nuclear power on 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.539
 this map is my very first 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.090
 on this map of course it's not my 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.889
 first nuclear so that's the level 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.259
 of your assets guys especially in 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.880
 hardcore playing with bulletproof vest 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.349
 very important so for not everything 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.419
 just that lans bull kills you 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.099
 because right now there are a lot of 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.169
 lens bull on black ops that's weird 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.690
 but listen, that's how I can do it 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.610
 nothing else you guys had me 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.680
 very important stone is not very much 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.820
 balls on the cac40 so in passing 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.830
 we go right to the second 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.900
 sleeve i made a break because 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 you will see that the enemies encamped in 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.330
 done in their spawn and so that's it 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.860
 simply 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.270
 an ally he sends his lightning 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.099
 so you were three so I 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.449
 asked morpheus that he sends his 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.039
 lightning to be able to dislodge them 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.680
 then I simply 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.789
 not place themselves in their spots so the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.199
 gameplay it was not at all 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.639
 spawn blocking because yes it's 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.919
 true that it's hard to block spawn at 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.810
 3 it was just a game 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.639
 in fact have tried everything was clear 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.259
 we can hardly consider that it is 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.330
 soil but good not too much since here it is 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.250
 are some micro station who was who 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.069
 were swayed you simply by my 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.840
 allies so here are now the 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.699
 old guy I'm going back a little bit 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.449
 about who were principal 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.669
 remakes 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.789
 so I'll tell you now 2 3 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.080
 maps that I would like them who 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.300
 simply appear in form 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.789
 of remake on advanced is warfare 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.020
 so I would like the map raid call 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.340
 of black ops because 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.379
 frankly that's a map that I 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.819
 surkiffe the guys the loan everything from the beginning 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.680
 well, finally, there's really a way to do 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.349
 some great stuff on this type of map 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.629
 the standoff map which is a mark that 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.639
 I appreciate a lot and without you 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:50.169
 lie also a last map 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.240
 I know a lot of people tell us 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.050
 what to put a crazy but map overflow 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.789
 the eia 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.349
 frankly it's matt I overkiffe 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.360
 so when we block the spawn and you 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.029
 to play on it is frankly a map 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.889
 excellent in passing the guys there 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.500
 nuclear will be unlocked soon 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.610
 now finally if I'm wrong 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.349
 because here I am not here 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.449
 nuclear has just been unblocked 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.039
 so here we are now at the end 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.110
 of this comment and I still hope 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.639
 that the video will please you I know that 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.960
 at this committee laughed more about the 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.219
 gameplay that the main subject 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.319
 but there was not much 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.360
 of things to say about the remakes especially 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.370
 do not forget to share your opinion by 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.229

 little green thumb and a small comment 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.550
 so also the gameplay it was a cajon 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.960
 strict gun so I will ask you a 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.219
 small live simply for this 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.409
 nice performance 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.460
 so here I hope that the 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.500
