00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
with evil growing stronger alone we can

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.030 
with evil growing stronger alone we can
only<00:00:04.589> do<00:00:05.009> so<00:00:05.400> little<00:00:05.790> but<00:00:06.509> together<00:00:06.750> we<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:07.589> do

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
only do so little but together we can do

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.450 
only do so little but together we can do
so<00:00:08.550> much<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.260> power<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.769> onua

than make up for any lack of speed all

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.130 
than make up for any lack of speed all
right<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> build<00:00:53.399> onua<00:00:54.000> Epsilon

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
right time to build onua Epsilon

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
right time to build onua Epsilon
as<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.590> might<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.829> guessed<00:00:56.160> you're<00:00:56.460> gonna

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
as you might have guessed you're gonna

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.869 
as you might have guessed you're gonna
need<00:00:56.910> onua<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.260> protector<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.010> Earth<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
need onua and the protector of Earth to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.229 
need onua and the protector of Earth to
build<00:01:00.059> him<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> starting<00:01:02.280> off<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.789> body

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
build him so starting off with the body

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.500 
build him so starting off with the body
and<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:04.769> armor<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.810> stick<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.710> head

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
and some armor it's stick on the head

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.179 
and some armor it's stick on the head
and<00:01:10.549> we're<00:01:11.549> gonna<00:01:11.640> build<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.240> gearbox

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
and we're gonna build the gearbox

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
and we're gonna build the gearbox
gearbox<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:14.850> weird<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.570> time

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
gearbox is a little weird this time

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
gearbox is a little weird this time
around<00:01:16.310> you're<00:01:17.310> gonna<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.759> why<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> because

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
around you're gonna see why so because

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.749 
around you're gonna see why so because
of<00:01:21.090> how<00:01:21.540> far<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.619> shoulders<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
of how far back the shoulders are on the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
of how far back the shoulders are on the
figure<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.780> designed<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> gearbox

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
figure I actually designed the gearbox

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
figure I actually designed the gearbox
to<00:01:26.280> sort<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.759> punch<00:01:27.299> forward<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to sort of punch forward with the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.480 
to sort of punch forward with the
shoulders<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:30.200> regrettably<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.890> makes<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
shoulders and regrettably this makes the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
shoulders and regrettably this makes the
gear<00:01:32.700> system<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.990> work<00:01:34.320> quite<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.100> well<00:01:35.369> as

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
gear system not work quite as well as

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.590 
gear system not work quite as well as
the<00:01:35.700> original<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.340> maybe<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.299> more

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the original so maybe if you have more

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.370 
the original so maybe if you have more
pieces<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.439> more<00:01:41.280> creativity<00:01:41.880> than<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
pieces and more creativity than I do you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
pieces and more creativity than I do you
can<00:01:43.530> fix<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.950> problem<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:44.850> now<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
can fix this problem but for now the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.969 
can fix this problem but for now the
gearbox<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:47.579> useless<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.979> there's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
gearbox is basically useless so there's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
gearbox is basically useless so there's
that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.130 
that
so<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.659> stick<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:53.720> working<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
so you stick it on and working on the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
so you stick it on and working on the
chest<00:01:55.470> bits<00:01:57.320> I'm<00:01:58.320> gonna<00:01:58.500> put<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:59.130> little

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
chest bits I'm gonna put these little

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.370 
chest bits I'm gonna put these little
pieces<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.890> along<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.430> other<00:02:02.820> ones

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
pieces on along with these other ones

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.059 
pieces on along with these other ones
and<00:02:05.659> next<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:07.140> gonna<00:02:07.380> stick<00:02:07.830> these

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and next I'm gonna stick these

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.580 
and next I'm gonna stick these
translucent<00:02:08.910> purple<00:02:09.390> pieces<00:02:09.929> with<00:02:10.289> some

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
translucent purple pieces with some

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.750 
translucent purple pieces with some
Armour<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.370> put

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
Armour like that and then you just put

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.110 
Armour like that and then you just put
them<00:02:14.849> together<00:02:19.550> all<00:02:20.550> right

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
them together all right

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.809 
them together all right
so<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:21.780> working<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.890> arms<00:02:25.549> those<00:02:26.549> look

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
so now working on the arms those look

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.670 
so now working on the arms those look
pretty<00:02:26.970> stubby<00:02:27.420> let's<00:02:28.170> give<00:02:28.350> them<00:02:28.440> some

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
pretty stubby let's give them some

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.800 
pretty stubby let's give them some
better<00:02:28.890> ones

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
better ones

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
better ones
they<00:02:30.810> use<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.200> shovel<00:02:31.440> pieces<00:02:32.720> basically<00:02:33.720> for

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
they use the shovel pieces basically for

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.690 
they use the shovel pieces basically for
his<00:02:34.260> arms<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.269> make<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.650> arms<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.340> this

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
his arms so you make the arms like this

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.170 
his arms so you make the arms like this
and<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.890> after<00:02:41.250> you're<00:02:41.370> done<00:02:41.489> with<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and then after you're done with that you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.509 
and then after you're done with that you
have<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.390> make<00:02:42.720> two<00:02:43.110> more<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.130> mirror

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
have to make two more but like a mirror

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.559 
have to make two more but like a mirror
image<00:02:45.380> after<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.069> basically<00:02:48.000> put<00:02:48.480> them

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569
