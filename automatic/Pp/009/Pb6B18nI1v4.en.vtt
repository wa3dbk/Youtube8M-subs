00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 Talk to the people here today. 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 for you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.960
 mugen almost 3d that for those who do not know 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.970
 is that mugen that he is has depth 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
 You can walk the scenery both to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.380
 up and down back to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 front as is normal 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.309
 as you can see see in the image the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.489
 this world was developed by the Polish 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 and I do not remember the date, and I too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 I do not have much information on 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 he and a few days ago a guy 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.910
 sent the tech blorge of the site and asked 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 for me to talk a little, it's how 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 this digital world works because it is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.660
 almost 3d because you can get your 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.460
 character walking through the background of the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 This is what I'm going to try to say quickly. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.899
 for you how it works 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.899
 so the staff is this muge if you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.549
 put in any char his today that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.510
 you download on the internet will not 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.799
 to function 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 this way because you have 11 in the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.390
 state called physics or physics 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 which is written that has within the cns 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.369
 leave documents 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.840
 he has and if I am not mistaken group 2 3 4 5 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.720
 6 and 7 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.130
 and these groups is on the kung fu menu they 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 have been programmed for when you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.930
 ask up instead of jumping 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.310
 He's going to go into the scenario I 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740
 I can not explain very well how it is that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.740
 Does this kind of interaction I know how it is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 that turns character of the world 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 for this kind of music 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.189
 now I do not quite know how it is that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 works the part of the scenario how does the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.350
 senar responds to this and as it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 transform a normal 2d scenario into a 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.000
 scenery almost 3 d 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.430
 the two and a half of what the people call this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.320
 way 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.850
 I was seeing here and beyond these 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.290
 codes and such you have to put 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.500
 Some animations were not yours. 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.520
 character is has to fill group 2 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.630
 over 17 800 and I'm not mistaken but 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.030
 Anyway, I'll leave it to you 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.150
 download this mugen only comes with kung fu 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.770
 I remember as soon as I could do some 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.480
 updates of my characters 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.420
 I'll bring it to you in mine. 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.160
 characters is with this 3d format and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.140
 I will also try to teach you how it is 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.239
 What do I do there? I have to admit that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.200
 You're not easy to make laugh. 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.200
 I think it's easier, it 's a 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 transformation at its headquarters eg a 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.420
 character than doing it here because 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.100
 both the character and the scenario they 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.980
 have to match the codes and such 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.080
 many times you know that change is a 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.300
 Your character can work very well. 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.820
 is not and someone else may not 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.709
 work may be wrong okay then I 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.800
 I'll try to make it right for you. 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.540
 but as I said the link of the 10th gitai 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.549
 in the video description I hope 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.480
 You like species without liking this. 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.870
 video and I'm bringing it already I've seen it says 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.120
 new tutorials and such and also some 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.440
 music videos and 57 minutes beauty 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.760
 said people thank you very much for seeing the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.760
