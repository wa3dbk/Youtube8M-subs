00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.080
 I won there for you as he reported a 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.840
 this when you do not want to do any 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.550
 other type of equipment for example 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.730
 be a tone if you do not want to 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.680
 fringes that only make the finish of it and 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.439
 for finalization 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.720
 so we'll have here the squares already 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.900
 all assembled 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.780
 all with their finishes as in the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.449
 another video I taught will catch 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.520
 here will make available to the 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.210
 The following way you will spend a 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.080
 chicken inside the other and that will 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.080
 generate your finish 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.760
 it will look like it is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.410
 made in crochet and he goes 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.420
 get this finish 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.280
 Then you 'll do it all over the place. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.899
 extension until you find the point here 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.170
 again 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.140
 preferably you always leave a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.910
 little piece of lan 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.220
 this little piece here ok will hold the 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.710
 last dot so you can give 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.509
 a nest node and make the arremate 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.920
 here I'm going to make only one piece for 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.350
 You are and have a sense of how it is not. 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.600
 do the whole play but you will start 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.740
 in the ring line by pulling one inside the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.369
 other 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.369
 thus 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.430
 in that you want to read a little more I 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.060
 I'll give it another pass. 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.790
 In this one that does not have argolinha you 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.570
 creates one that neither in cement again 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.710
 Oh, another big one, you're going to get it here. 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.750
 again and will get another one she will 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.000
 do this here we keep going 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 until the end 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.020
 a chicken inside the other the fan 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.009
 inside the other 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.690
 what escaped a bombinha 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.230
 here with a speck but I will 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.090
 Fixing it, he eats it back to the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.129
 place and when you can not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.470
 hand can give a little dot with a needle 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.120
 there is no rule 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.129
 the important thing is that your piece is 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.340
 beautiful and well finished high arriving in 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.340

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:17.250
 the inside and then I will cast off 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.950
 learning back here in our own 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.829
