00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
totally out of left field but I've got

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.089 
totally out of left field but I've got

to say love it this reminds me of

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.800 
to say love it this reminds me of
intolerable<00:03:00.549> cruelty<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.390> believe

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
intolerable cruelty and I to believe

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.860 
intolerable cruelty and I to believe
that<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.680> office<00:03:03.129> where<00:03:03.819> Jason<00:03:04.329> Statham

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
that the office where Jason Statham

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.229 
that the office where Jason Statham
comes<00:03:05.079> in<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.590> confronts<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.459> guy<00:03:06.609> with<00:03:07.209> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
comes in and confronts that guy with the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.910 
comes in and confronts that guy with the
chandelier<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.019> wood<00:03:08.260> paneling<00:03:08.620> behind

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
chandelier in the wood paneling behind

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.559 
chandelier in the wood paneling behind
him<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.250> think<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.849> know<00:03:10.030> correct<00:03:10.329> me<00:03:10.420> if<00:03:10.480> I'm

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
him I think you know correct me if I'm

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.630 
him I think you know correct me if I'm
wrong<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:11.140> know<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:11.829> just<00:03:12.190> off<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.459> top<00:03:12.609> of

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
wrong you know but just off the top of

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.309 
wrong you know but just off the top of
my<00:03:12.790> head<00:03:12.940> seeing<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.510> think<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.049> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
my head seeing it I think that is the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.680 
my head seeing it I think that is the
same<00:03:14.560> office<00:03:15.459> from<00:03:15.609> intolerable<00:03:16.150> cruelty<00:03:16.540> so

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
same office from intolerable cruelty so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.030 
same office from intolerable cruelty so
I<00:03:16.720> guess<00:03:16.930> maybe<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.349> Texas<00:03:17.709> or<00:03:17.859> something

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
I guess maybe in Texas or something

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.130 
I guess maybe in Texas or something
there's<00:03:18.549> an<00:03:18.700> office<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.120> lets<00:03:19.269> people<00:03:19.450> shoot

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
there's an office that lets people shoot

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.039 
there's an office that lets people shoot
in<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.409> for<00:03:21.190> studios<00:03:21.609> but<00:03:21.940> let<00:03:22.659> me<00:03:22.750> just<00:03:22.959> say

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
in it for studios but let me just say

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.449 
in it for studios but let me just say
this<00:03:23.230> looks<00:03:23.470> like<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.650> most<00:03:23.859> fun<00:03:24.099> I've<00:03:24.250> seen

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
this looks like the most fun I've seen

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.160 
this looks like the most fun I've seen
Jason<00:03:24.909> Statham<00:03:25.239> having<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.540> movie<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.959> long

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
Jason Statham having a movie in a long

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.710 
Jason Statham having a movie in a long
time<00:03:26.500> maybe<00:03:26.920> ever<00:03:27.159> I<00:03:27.760> love<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.359> he's<00:03:28.450> playing

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
time maybe ever I love that he's playing

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.899 
time maybe ever I love that he's playing
with<00:03:28.870> his<00:03:29.019> image<00:03:29.349> he<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.220> he's<00:03:30.400> pulling<00:03:30.790> off

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
with his image he can he's pulling off

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.550 
with his image he can he's pulling off
these<00:03:31.120> other<00:03:31.299> identities<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.230> think<00:03:32.410> that's

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
these other identities I think that's

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.259 
these other identities I think that's
really<00:03:32.709> cool<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.250> lot<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.639> times<00:03:33.790> actors<00:03:34.150> will

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
really cool a lot of times actors will

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.970 
really cool a lot of times actors will
try<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.510> do<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.560> doesn't<00:03:35.859> work

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
try to do this and it just doesn't work

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.530 
try to do this and it just doesn't work
out<00:03:36.250> but<00:03:36.459> he<00:03:36.579> seems<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:37.030> doing<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.329> really

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
out but he seems to be doing a really

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.409 
out but he seems to be doing a really
nice<00:03:37.720> job<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:38.739> each<00:03:38.980> identity<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.700> think<00:03:40.209> this

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
nice job in each identity I think this

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.089 
nice job in each identity I think this
is<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.569> good<00:03:40.750> move<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:40.989> Jennifer<00:03:41.590> Lopez<00:03:41.620> as

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
is a good move for Jennifer Lopez as

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.300 
is a good move for Jennifer Lopez as
well<00:03:43.169> it's<00:03:44.169> like<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.470> film<00:03:44.680> she<00:03:44.829> made<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
well it's like the film she made you

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.470 
well it's like the film she made you
know<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.549> one<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.849> made<00:03:46.000> her<00:03:46.090> really<00:03:46.209> famous

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
know the one that made her really famous

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.789 
know the one that made her really famous
was<00:03:46.810> George<00:03:46.989> Clooney<00:03:47.319> I<00:03:47.410> think<00:03:47.470> that's

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
was George Clooney I think that's

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.920 
was George Clooney I think that's
fantastic<00:03:48.459> for<00:03:48.639> her<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.419> know<00:03:49.450> kind<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.840> be

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
fantastic for her to you know kind of be

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.039 
fantastic for her to you know kind of be
echoing<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.370> also<00:03:51.730> she's<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:52.629> it

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
echoing that and also she's not but it

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.869 
echoing that and also she's not but it
might<00:03:53.109> change<00:03:53.530> she<00:03:53.859> might<00:03:54.010> be<00:03:54.129> like<00:03:54.310> seek<00:03:54.639> you

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
might change she might be like seek you

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.280 
might change she might be like seek you
know<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.269> might<00:03:55.480> be<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.599> twist<00:03:55.930> we<00:03:56.139> should

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
know it might be a twist we should

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.750 
know it might be a twist we should
become<00:03:56.470> incredibly<00:03:56.889> confident<00:03:57.370> toward<00:03:57.639> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
become incredibly confident toward the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.339 
become incredibly confident toward the
end<00:03:57.879> but<00:03:58.449> right<00:03:58.629> now<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.139> it's<00:03:59.260> a

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
end but right now I like that it's a

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.140 
end but right now I like that it's a
different<00:03:59.379> kind<00:03:59.859> of<00:04:00.040> role<00:04:00.579> for<00:04:00.819> her<00:04:00.910> more

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
different kind of role for her more

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.869 
different kind of role for her more
damsel<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.780> distress<00:04:01.959> or<00:04:02.500> oh<00:04:02.650> I'm<00:04:03.220> stuck<00:04:03.519> going

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879

along<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.449> and<00:04:04.629> I<00:04:04.660> didn't<00:04:04.870> want<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.169> so

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
along with this and I didn't want to so

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.689 
along with this and I didn't want to so
that's<00:04:05.500> nice<00:04:05.709> for<00:04:05.739> her<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.190> think<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.459> makes<00:04:06.579> her

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
that's nice for her I think it makes her

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.059
