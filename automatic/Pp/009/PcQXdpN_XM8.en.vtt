00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
viewers through where the aircraft is
and<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:26.100> homes<00:01:26.399> were<00:01:26.670> damaged<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and which homes were damaged was it just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
and which homes were damaged was it just
this<00:01:27.690> one<00:01:27.899> here<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.289> you<00:01:28.409> saw<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.979> looks

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this one here that you saw so it looks

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649 
this one here that you saw so it looks
like<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.369> aircraft<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.940> in<00:01:30.179> front<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.539> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
like the aircraft is in front of the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.139 
like the aircraft is in front of the
house<00:01:30.929> next<00:01:31.259> door<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.610> think<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
house next door to it but I think that

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.449 
house next door to it but I think that
these<00:01:33.869> three<00:01:34.140> houses<00:01:34.440> have<00:01:34.770> been<00:01:34.920> affected

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
these three houses have been affected

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.699 
these three houses have been affected
obviously<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:36.270> major<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
obviously that's the major one to the

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.620 
obviously that's the major one to the
left<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.429> where<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> aircraft<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:39.330> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
left of it is where the aircraft was and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
left of it is where the aircraft was and
that's<00:01:39.750> been<00:01:40.020> damaged<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> left

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's been damaged and then to the left

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190 
that's been damaged and then to the left
of<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.429> at<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.119> house<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:42.869> like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
of that at the other house it looks like

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.139 
of that at the other house it looks like
the<00:01:43.319> window<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.220> roof<00:01:44.399> has<00:01:44.610> been<00:01:44.640> damaged

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the window and the roof has been damaged

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.669 
the window and the roof has been damaged
as<00:01:45.330> well<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.049> looks<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.440> heat

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
as well right it looks like the heat

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.440 
as well right it looks like the heat
from<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> fire<00:01:47.310> may<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.640> melting<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
from the fire may be melting some of the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
from the fire may be melting some of the
siding<00:01:48.810> yeah<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.709> could<00:01:50.009> care<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
siding yeah and we actually could care a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710 
siding yeah and we actually could care a
couple<00:01:50.490> explosions<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.149> weren't<00:01:51.360> sure<00:01:51.539> if<00:01:51.569> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
couple explosions we weren't sure if it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
couple explosions we weren't sure if it
was<00:01:51.869> their<00:01:52.140> gas<00:01:52.350> line<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.679> was<00:01:53.009> blowing<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
was their gas line I was blowing you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
was their gas line I was blowing you
know<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.000> heard<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.330> maybe<00:01:54.629> twice<00:01:55.069> for<00:01:56.069> people

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
know we heard it maybe twice for people

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.180 
know we heard it maybe twice for people
who<00:01:56.369> can't<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.819> here<00:01:56.849> describe<00:01:57.629> the<00:01:57.780> snow
