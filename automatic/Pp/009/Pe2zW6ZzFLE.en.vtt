breadcrumb<00:01:35.190> consistency<00:01:41.149> now<00:01:42.149> it's<00:01:42.300> up<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
breadcrumb consistency now it's up to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.870 
breadcrumb consistency now it's up to
you<00:01:42.780> how<00:01:43.140> coarse<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.979> want<00:01:44.190> this<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> want

it<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.180> finer<00:01:45.360> pulse<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.050> more<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it a little finer pulse it more if you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.109 
it a little finer pulse it more if you
all<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.860> more<00:01:47.039> texture<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> leave<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
all have more texture to it leave it a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.680 
all have more texture to it leave it a
little<00:01:48.330> bit<00:01:48.509> chunkier<00:01:53.390> all<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:54.570> think

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
little bit chunkier all right I think

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.910 
little bit chunkier all right I think
we're<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.380> crust<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

salmon is done I just add it into a bowl

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.630 
salmon is done I just add it into a bowl
so<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:01.800> reach<00:02:02.130> into<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> food

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so we don't reach into the food

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
so we don't reach into the food
processor<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.300> bit<00:02:03.390> easier<00:02:03.720> for<00:02:03.750> you
