00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
chest ascender set up could be about

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.010 
chest ascender set up could be about
right<00:00:19.230> as<00:00:19.500> close<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.820> get<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.990> a

millimeter<00:01:12.510> nine<00:01:12.810> millimeter<00:01:13.290> I'll<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
millimeter nine millimeter I'll do that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
too and I'm just recently started using

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910 
too and I'm just recently started using
nine<00:01:17.159> millimeter<00:01:17.610> Max<00:01:17.970> wear<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
nine millimeter Max wear and it is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
nine millimeter Max wear and it is
pretty<00:01:20.220> slick<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:21.030> nice<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.570> don't

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pretty slick but that's nice you don't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.660 
pretty slick but that's nice you don't
even<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> hold<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.770> between<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.430> feet

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
even have to hold this between your feet

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
even have to hold this between your feet
and<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> throw<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> over<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.530> shoulder<00:01:26.009> or

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
something so you can grab it later to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.830 
something so you can grab it later to
take<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.409> feeds<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.189> through

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
take it up it just feeds right through

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
take it up it just feeds right through
so<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> first<00:01:31.350> things<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> do

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so one of the first things I need to do

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.539 
so one of the first things I need to do
is<00:01:32.689> get<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.049> line<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.100> next<00:01:35.369> thing

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
is get this on line and the next thing

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
is get this on line and the next thing
is<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> decide<00:01:36.600> where<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
is I need to decide where I want to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.890 
is I need to decide where I want to
route<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.829> rope<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> between<00:01:39.329> my

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
route my rope do I want it between my

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
route my rope do I want it between my
legs<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.790> foot<00:01:42.030> loops<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.420> be

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
legs like this the foot loops will be

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.230 
legs like this the foot loops will be
down<00:01:42.750> through<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.649> it'll<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.850> trapped

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
down through here and it'll be trapped

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
down through here and it'll be trapped
in<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> triangle<00:01:46.409> formed<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.829> my<00:01:46.950> legs<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in this triangle formed with my legs and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.940 
in this triangle formed with my legs and
the<00:01:47.520> foot<00:01:47.729> loops<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:49.020> found<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.680> what

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the foot loops and I found that what

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
the foot loops and I found that what
happens<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
happens when you do that and you do the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.240 
happens when you do that and you do the
stroke<00:01:52.549> things<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:54.030> caught<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
stroke things get caught here and it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
stroke things get caught here and it
causes<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> rope<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.270> buckle<00:01:57.719> instead<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
causes the rope to buckle instead of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.380 
causes the rope to buckle instead of
feed<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.460> probably<00:01:59.759> not<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> good<00:02:00.210> thing

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
feed so that's probably not a good thing

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.530 
feed so that's probably not a good thing
as<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.500> late<00:02:01.770> I've<00:02:02.009> been<00:02:02.610> putting<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.060> over<00:02:03.329> my

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
as of late I've been putting it over my

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
as of late I've been putting it over my
right<00:02:03.810> foot<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:05.100> been<00:02:05.399> working<00:02:05.610> out

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
right foot and that's been working out

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.160 
right foot and that's been working out
well<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> continue<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.390 

all<00:02:12.170> right<00:02:12.319> I'm<00:02:12.409> still<00:02:12.590> have<00:02:12.769> my<00:02:12.890> tether<00:02:13.159> and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
all right I'm still have my tether and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.850 
all right I'm still have my tether and
foot<00:02:13.640> loop<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:15.019> into<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.349> foot<00:02:15.560> loops

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
foot loop so to get into the foot loops

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.729 
foot loop so to get into the foot loops
I<00:02:16.040> need<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.780> little<00:02:17.989> more<00:02:18.079> slack

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
I need to get a little more slack

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.089 
I need to get a little more slack
out<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:19.159> my<00:02:19.310> tether<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.939> I<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.269> sit<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.890> I'm

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
out of my tether so I can sit and I'm

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.600 
out of my tether so I can sit and I'm
hoping<00:02:22.670> I've<00:02:22.819> got<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.239> camera<00:02:23.659> set<00:02:23.689> up

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
hoping I've got the camera set up

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.490 
hoping I've got the camera set up
correctly<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.700> swing<00:02:26.239> on<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.659> tree<00:02:27.109> just<00:02:27.140> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
correctly I swing on this tree just a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.520 
correctly I swing on this tree just a
little<00:02:27.709> bit<00:02:28.150> away<00:02:29.150> from<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.510> camera<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.230> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
little bit away from the camera so I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.740 
little bit away from the camera so I
kind<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.459> have<00:02:31.609> to<00:02:31.640> guess<00:02:32.030> at<00:02:32.269> where<00:02:32.450> I'm<00:02:32.540> going

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
kind of have to guess at where I'm going

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.500 
kind of have to guess at where I'm going
to<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.260> set<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> camera<00:02:34.609> accordingly<00:02:35.239> as

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
to be and set the camera accordingly as

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.679 
to be and set the camera accordingly as
you<00:02:36.409> can<00:02:36.620> see<00:02:36.829> I'm<00:02:37.010> already<00:02:37.220> drifting<00:02:40.480> okay<00:02:41.480> so

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
you can see I'm already drifting okay so

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.349 
you can see I'm already drifting okay so
I<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:41.989> my<00:02:42.019> foot<00:02:42.379> loops<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.859> now<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:44.090> have

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
I have my foot loops on now and I have

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.360 
I have my foot loops on now and I have
my<00:02:44.569> rope<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:48.290> over<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> outer<00:02:48.859> edge<00:02:49.159> of

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
my rope going over the outer edge of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.070 
my rope going over the outer edge of
that<00:02:50.260> I'm<00:02:51.260> going<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> put<00:02:51.799> my

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.520 

hether<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.630> we'll<00:02:59.630> be<00:02:59.660> ready<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.200> do<00:03:00.350> some

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.900 
you're going to be able to take some
more<00:03:07.850> slack<00:03:08.240> out<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.980> want<00:03:10.190> some<00:03:10.580> you

don't want to make it terribly

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.190 
don't want to make it terribly
uncomfortable<00:03:12.950> on<00:03:13.310> yourself<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.870> more

you can slack you can take out of here

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.330 
you can slack you can take out of here
the<00:03:18.440> further<00:03:18.680> you're<00:03:18.830> going<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.070> be<00:03:19.130> able<00:03:19.190> to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
the further you're going to be able to

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.760 
the further you're going to be able to
raise<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.390> let's<00:03:20.600> take<00:03:20.660> one<00:03:21.110> stroke<00:03:21.500> and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
raise it so let's take one stroke and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.160 
raise it so let's take one stroke and
see<00:03:21.980> where<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.310> are<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.760> as<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.450> do<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.690> keep

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
see where we are and as I do this keep

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.920 
see where we are and as I do this keep
in<00:03:24.350> mind<00:03:24.590> when<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.220> ascender<00:03:25.880> reaches<00:03:26.750> this

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
in mind when this ascender reaches this

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.740 
in mind when this ascender reaches this
ascender<00:03:27.530> my<00:03:27.740> leg<00:03:28.040> should<00:03:28.400> be<00:03:28.460> about<00:03:29.180> straight

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
ascender my leg should be about straight

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.590 
ascender my leg should be about straight
so<00:03:30.380> I'm<00:03:30.770> going<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:30.980> take<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:32.020> stroke<00:03:33.020> upward<00:03:33.560> and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
so I'm going to take a stroke upward and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.540 
so I'm going to take a stroke upward and
you<00:03:35.600> see<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.700> get<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.230> there<00:03:39.230> we<00:03:39.440> go<00:03:39.590> my<00:03:40.280> legs

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
you see you get the there we go my legs

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.820 
you see you get the there we go my legs
are<00:03:40.790> straight<00:03:41.150> notice<00:03:41.930> how<00:03:42.080> these<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.560> kind

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
are straight notice how these have kind

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.240 
are straight notice how these have kind
of<00:03:42.890> timed<00:03:43.220> out<00:03:43.490> now<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.720> could<00:03:45.080> make<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.890> come

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
of timed out now I could make this come

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.460 
of timed out now I could make this come
all<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.550> way<00:03:46.580> up<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.970> here<00:03:47.330> by<00:03:47.900> shortening<00:03:48.440> my

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
all the way up to here by shortening my

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.920 
all the way up to here by shortening my
foot<00:03:48.890> loops<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.280> little<00:03:49.520> bit<00:03:49.930> probably

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
foot loops a little bit probably

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.410 
foot loops a little bit probably
unnecessary<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:52.040> get<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.580> pretty<00:03:52.850> good<00:03:53.030> stroke

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
unnecessary I get a pretty good stroke

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.690 
unnecessary I get a pretty good stroke
as<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:54.020> and<00:03:54.290> I'm<00:03:54.380> not<00:03:54.590> going<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.160> maximum

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
as it is and I'm not going for a maximum

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.010 
as it is and I'm not going for a maximum
stroke<00:03:55.970> here<00:03:56.209> because<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.510> got<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.720> get<00:03:56.810> back

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
stroke here because I got to get back

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.080 
stroke here because I got to get back
down<00:03:58.150> speaking<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.300> getting<00:03:59.450> back<00:03:59.810> down<00:04:01.090> this

down you might not want to use the Frog
or<00:04:26.810> Texas<00:04:27.260> system<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.800> I'll<00:04:28.190> be<00:04:28.400> showing<00:04:28.640> you

Reds<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:30.320> SRT<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.160> might<00:04:31.340> be<00:04:31.520> more

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
Reds for SRT that might be more

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.370 
Reds for SRT that might be more
appropriate<00:04:31.790> for<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.330> let's<00:04:32.990> do<00:04:33.140> one<00:04:33.290> more

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
appropriate for that let's do one more

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.320 
appropriate for that let's do one more
stroke<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.040> I<00:04:34.100> think<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.430> can<00:04:34.610> still<00:04:34.850> reach<00:04:35.090> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
stroke and I think I can still reach the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.500 
stroke and I think I can still reach the
ground<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.250> you'll<00:04:37.250> notice<00:04:37.520> I'm<00:04:37.820> putting<00:04:38.270> one

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
ground and you'll notice I'm putting one

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.780 
ground and you'll notice I'm putting one
hand<00:04:38.570> up<00:04:39.020> here<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.560> I've<00:04:39.710> got<00:04:39.979> both<00:04:40.280> arms

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
hand up here so I've got both arms

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.770 
hand up here so I've got both arms
pulling<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.479> I<00:04:41.780> just<00:04:42.050> press<00:04:42.350> up<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:44.600> can

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
pulling and I just press up and you can

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.980 
pulling and I just press up and you can
see<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.919> chest<00:04:46.580> ascender<00:04:46.940> self<00:04:47.419> advancing

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
see the chest ascender self advancing

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.290 
see the chest ascender self advancing
once<00:04:48.260> again<00:04:48.560> my<00:04:48.770> legs<00:04:49.010> are<00:04:49.220> straight<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.729> it's

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
once again my legs are straight and it's

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.750 
once again my legs are straight and it's
where<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.540> want<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.020> be<00:04:51.229> if<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:52.160> gets<00:04:52.370> up<00:04:52.580> any

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
where I want it to be if it gets up any

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.219 
where I want it to be if it gets up any
further<00:04:53.060> it's<00:04:53.330> going<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.570> start<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.990> mash

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
further it's going to start to mash

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.409 
further it's going to start to mash
fingers<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.979> stuff<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:55.910> that's<00:04:56.120> about<00:04:56.270> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
fingers and stuff so that's about the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.880 
fingers and stuff so that's about the
limit<00:04:56.720> on<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:58.900> alright<00:04:59.930> normally<00:05:00.530> at<00:05:00.680> this

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
limit on that alright normally at this

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.969 
limit on that alright normally at this
point<00:05:01.479> I'm<00:05:02.479> taking<00:05:02.990> slack<00:05:03.290> out<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.620> my<00:05:03.710> tether

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
point I'm taking slack out of my tether

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.850 
point I'm taking slack out of my tether
right<00:05:04.280> now<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:05.720> do<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> changeover<00:05:06.560> where<00:05:06.770> you

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
right now you do a changeover where you

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.550 
right now you do a changeover where you
put<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.190> descender<00:05:07.970> here<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.570> stand<00:05:09.169> up<00:05:09.350> and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
put a descender here and stand up and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.930

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.610 
take the slack out take this
I'm<00:05:11.090> not<00:05:11.300> going<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.540> do<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.990> because<00:05:12.230> it's

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
I'm not going to do that because it's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.130 
I'm not going to do that because it's
that's<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.700> too<00:05:13.820> low<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.210> ground<00:05:14.300> but<00:05:15.110> I

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
that's just too low to the ground but I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.750

way I'm going to do that is raise this a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.150 
way I'm going to do that is raise this a
cinder<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:18.980> as<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.760> go<00:05:19.940> up<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.420> time<00:05:21.160> I'm

I don't need my foot loop so I'm going

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.550 
I don't need my foot loop so I'm going
to<00:05:39.350> get<00:05:39.530> out<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.800> them<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:41.170> you<00:05:42.170> might<00:05:42.380> be

because you can't get your weight off
that<00:05:46.400> well<00:05:46.820> actually<00:05:47.060> I<00:05:47.360> can<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:48.520> have<00:05:49.520> an

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
adjustable tether and I can simply

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.420

don't want to rappel out of reach of
your<00:06:02.960> cinder<00:06:03.790> but<00:06:04.790> that's<00:06:05.300> only<00:06:05.540> if<00:06:05.750> you're

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
your cinder but that's only if you're

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.180 
your cinder but that's only if you're
low<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.170> the<00:06:06.350> ground<00:06:06.410> or<00:06:06.770> you're<00:06:06.890> just<00:06:06.920> going

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
low to the ground or you're just going

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.950 
low to the ground or you're just going
to<00:06:07.220> drop<00:06:07.430> down<00:06:07.640> to<00:06:07.700> a<00:06:07.910> limb<00:06:08.210> right<00:06:08.450> below<00:06:08.780> you

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
to drop down to a limb right below you

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.680 
to drop down to a limb right below you
or<00:06:09.050> something<00:06:09.470> so<00:06:09.680> it<00:06:10.340> is<00:06:10.550> handy<00:06:11.000> you<00:06:11.330> can<00:06:11.480> see

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
or something so it is handy you can see

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.540 
or something so it is handy you can see
how<00:06:11.780> much<00:06:11.930> room<00:06:11.990> I've<00:06:12.440> got<00:06:12.740> there<00:06:13.010> so<00:06:13.190> I've<00:06:13.340> got

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
how much room I've got there so I've got

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.320 
how much room I've got there so I've got
some<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.960> go<00:06:15.290> it<00:06:16.070> works<00:06:16.669> really<00:06:17.030> well<00:06:17.120> for

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
some to go it works really well for

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.870 
some to go it works really well for
unloading<00:06:17.930> things<00:06:18.350> and<00:06:18.770> changing<00:06:19.490> over<00:06:19.760> and

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
unloading things and changing over and

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.580 
unloading things and changing over and
doing<00:06:20.000> some<00:06:20.240> stuff<00:06:20.480> like<00:06:20.660> that<00:06:20.960> so<00:06:21.470> that's

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
doing some stuff like that so that's

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.260 
doing some stuff like that so that's
pretty<00:06:21.770> much<00:06:21.860> how<00:06:22.100> this<00:06:22.250> frog<00:06:22.550> system<00:06:23.030> works

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
pretty much how this frog system works

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.960 
pretty much how this frog system works
all<00:06:24.230> in<00:06:24.470> all<00:06:24.590> it's<00:06:24.919> probably<00:06:25.340> my<00:06:25.490> favorite

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
all in all it's probably my favorite

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.400 
all in all it's probably my favorite
climbing<00:06:26.390> system<00:06:26.780> when<00:06:26.960> I<00:06:27.050> go<00:06:27.230> out<00:06:27.380> for

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
climbing system when I go out for

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.520 
climbing system when I go out for
exercise<00:06:27.950> to<00:06:28.550> get<00:06:29.180> some<00:06:29.450> workouts<00:06:30.230> in<00:06:30.410> the

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
exercise to get some workouts in the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.159 
exercise to get some workouts in the
trees<00:06:30.830> it's<00:06:31.610> what<00:06:31.880> I<00:06:31.910> use<00:06:32.300> except<00:06:32.690> I<00:06:32.780> use<00:06:32.990> my

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
trees it's what I use except I use my

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.290 
trees it's what I use except I use my
double<00:06:33.560> handle<00:06:33.919> syndrome<00:06:34.400> it's<00:06:34.850> probably<00:06:35.240> the

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
double handle syndrome it's probably the

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.000 
double handle syndrome it's probably the
most<00:06:35.390> popular<00:06:35.720> climbing<00:06:36.440> system<00:06:36.830> in<00:06:36.950> the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
most popular climbing system in the

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.450 
most popular climbing system in the
world

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
world

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.420 
world
it's<00:06:37.700> not<00:06:38.000> as<00:06:38.150> efficient<00:06:38.630> as<00:06:38.750> a<00:06:38.780> rope<00:06:39.080> walker

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
it's not as efficient as a rope walker

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.010 
it's not as efficient as a rope walker
but<00:06:40.430> it's<00:06:40.580> close<00:06:40.910> to<00:06:40.940> as<00:06:41.300> efficient<00:06:41.780> as<00:06:41.870> sumo

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
but it's close to as efficient as sumo

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.170 
but it's close to as efficient as sumo
and<00:06:43.440> you<00:06:43.740> can<00:06:43.950> convert<00:06:44.280> for<00:06:44.610> all<00:06:44.670> over<00:06:44.910> Texas

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
and you can convert for all over Texas

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.570 
and you can convert for all over Texas
to<00:06:45.540> a<00:06:45.570> rope<00:06:45.840> Walker<00:06:46.290> maybe<00:06:46.920> I<00:06:47.040> can<00:06:47.250> do<00:06:47.370> a<00:06:47.430> video

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
to a rope Walker maybe I can do a video

00:06:47.580 --> 00:07:00.879 
to a rope Walker maybe I can do a video
on<00:06:47.790> that<00:06:47.970> so<00:06:48.720> there's<00:06:49.260> our<00:06:49.470> promises
