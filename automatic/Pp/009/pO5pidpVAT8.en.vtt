defensive work quite a lot cheaper than
what<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.430> thought<00:04:11.459> he'd<00:04:11.759> be<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.599> can't<00:04:12.810> see

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
what I thought he'd be and you can't see

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.059 
what I thought he'd be and you can't see
my<00:04:13.019> goal<00:04:13.199> to<00:04:13.319> game<00:04:13.439> with<00:04:13.590> him<00:04:13.709> because<00:04:13.799> it<00:04:13.949> just

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
my goal to game with him because it just

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.439 
my goal to game with him because it just
doesn't<00:04:14.459> seem<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.729> be<00:04:14.789> working<00:04:14.819> at<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.209> moment

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
doesn't seem to be working at the moment

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.499 
doesn't seem to be working at the moment
it's<00:04:15.539> a<00:04:15.569> little<00:04:15.750> glitch<00:04:16.340> but<00:04:17.340> 97<00:04:18.060> pays<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.389> him

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
it's a little glitch but 97 pays for him

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.959 
it's a little glitch but 97 pays for him
and<00:04:18.690> 98<00:04:19.259> on<00:04:19.409> the<00:04:19.530> right<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.919> 88<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.729> left

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
and 98 on the right and 88 on the left

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.939 
and 98 on the right and 88 on the left
so<00:04:21.269> there's<00:04:21.449> two<00:04:21.570> squad<00:04:21.840> go<00:04:22.620> through<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.889> very

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
so there's two squad go through it very

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.800 
so there's two squad go through it very
quickly<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:23.490> solid<00:04:24.000> centre-backs<00:04:24.449> is<00:04:24.630> what

nating<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.890> left<00:05:23.100> back<00:05:23.280> is<00:05:23.430> definitely<00:05:23.820> the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
nating the left back is definitely the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.400 
nating the left back is definitely the
weak<00:05:24.030> point<00:05:24.330> if<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.750> can<00:05:24.870> get<00:05:24.990> someone<00:05:25.290> else

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
weak point if you can get someone else

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.380 
weak point if you can get someone else
there<00:05:25.500> either<00:05:26.130> putting<00:05:26.550> maybe<00:05:26.730> man<00:05:26.970> united

there either putting maybe man united

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.520 
there either putting maybe man united
player<00:05:27.600> in<00:05:27.780> or<00:05:27.870> something<00:05:28.080> like<00:05:28.140> that<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.440> get

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
player in or something like that to get

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.960

better<00:05:28.710> chemistry<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.460> would<00:05:29.820> definitely

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
better chemistry I would definitely

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.390
