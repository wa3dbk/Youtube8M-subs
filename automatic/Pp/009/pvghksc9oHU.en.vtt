Barry<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.040> guess<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.610> think<00:02:13.970> that's<00:02:14.090> what<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.300> was

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
Barry I guess I think that's what it was

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.540 
Barry I guess I think that's what it was
the<00:02:15.140> main<00:02:15.290> focus<00:02:15.680> was<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.190> makes<00:02:16.340> sense

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
the main focus was but this makes sense

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.010 
the main focus was but this makes sense
because<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> video<00:02:17.030> boiron<00:02:17.420> kills<00:02:17.750> Barry

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
because the video boiron kills Barry

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.520 
because the video boiron kills Barry
then<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:19.010> means<00:02:19.280> he's<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> be<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
then that means he's not going to be the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.560 
then that means he's not going to be the
reverse<00:02:21.680> flash<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.210> comics
