00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.750 

turns<00:00:34.720> out<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.020> Central<00:00:35.380> American<00:00:35.470> was<00:00:36.070> wild

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
turns out the Central American was wild

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.330 
turns out the Central American was wild
and<00:00:37.060> it<00:00:37.180> was<00:00:37.420> rugged<00:00:37.840> but<00:00:38.710> there's<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.950> reason

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
and it was rugged but there's a reason

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.950 
and it was rugged but there's a reason
why<00:00:39.520> there<00:00:39.760> aren't<00:00:39.910> a<00:00:40.000> lot<00:00:40.150> of<00:00:40.210> boaters<00:00:40.510> going

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
why there aren't a lot of boaters going

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.690 
why there aren't a lot of boaters going
there<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.470> that's<00:00:41.650> because<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.460> weather

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
there and that's because the weather

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.510 
there and that's because the weather
systems<00:00:43.210> are<00:00:43.360> difficult<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.230> deal<00:00:44.410> with<00:00:44.520> there

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
systems are difficult to deal with there

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.760
