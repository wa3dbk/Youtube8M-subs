00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 how do i go from the beast and blue name 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 portal 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 you need some kind of pen there sign 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.120
 you make a circle that is the lid that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.540
 we are going to take it off and then you sign 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.490
 actually stretched along here comes that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.619
 I will now hand you like what we 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.279
 put candles in because it's going to be one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.410
 cover this must remain free 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.740
 now i have the contour of the lid 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 signed and I will now cut it out 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 very simple you press it in and if you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.829
 There have pressed just go start 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.090
 with sawing this is really one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.090
 hair colors crashes believe me 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:57.300
 Almost there they could could go there and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 move a little and then have fun 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.359
 here we can of course completely 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 nothing with that creates an ordinary whole 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.140
 easy out of this are just pips and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.840
 wires 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.869
 you can eat pumpkin seed moving 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.170
 its nice that looked or do through 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170
 bread 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.810
 I now let the flesh of the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.330
 pumpkin sit for our firmness 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.650
 party lamp but you can be very tasty 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.210
 make things out of 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.940
 you sometimes have pumpkin meat 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.620
 eaten pumpkin t 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.320
 no then you need that floral foam gun 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.630
 and I'll show you what he is like 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 empty 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 and what is missing now I'm going to party skin 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.130
 natural holes where the light 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.420
 can shine through and how to do that 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.690
 it also very simple 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.960
 I make my own template oh 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.750
 you can also download them on the website 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 but is of course much nicer to 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.900
 to be who 's dry my hands 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.400
 make if can't draw 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.940
 it is of course much nicer to you 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.170
 have your own draw there you are 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.780
 draw how only three templates and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 with that I am going to pimp heaven's broods 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.770
 another mine she added 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.760
 you ca n't draw diamonds with strokes 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.100
 as we technical draftsman we go 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.739
 only the outer shape 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.489
 namely just do it stand up 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.560
 I just agree 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.000
 but well those stripes that go 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.360
 of course does not exclude the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360
 contour 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.880
 I got this formula out 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:44.400
 which I stick the stars on the street I would 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.300
 so line it then I know later 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.780
 exactly where it's not quite the whistle and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.780
 then the first to do nothing 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.660
 star month diamond the sit 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.660
 now the next step is leaving 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.200
 Yes 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.319
 and now I have it completely 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.719
 cut out and another handy tip 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.609
 always from the inside 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.370
 star crawling skin as I am now 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.829
 seems very nice to this star and real 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.730
 golden edge the one what I would go with 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.730
 do all forms 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.709
 Well you are hard working form 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.540
 gold cut it around but must be there 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.810
 was a boring because he is nice and okay now 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.050
 how missing they were party lite 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.050
 to slip 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.000
 last glitter 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.620
 would then looks and did well 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.270
 pay attention here it will be later 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.560
 candle in because then it goes 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.560
 of course really shine
