in medical science a report released

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.970 
in medical science a report released
yesterday<00:00:17.670> by<00:00:18.060> John<00:00:18.420> Hopkins<00:00:18.630> University

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.679 
yesterday by John Hopkins University
details<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> 2<00:00:20.699> year<00:00:20.880> old<00:00:21.029> child<00:00:21.330> in

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
details how a 2 year old child in

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.009 
details how a 2 year old child in
Mississippi<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.859> cured<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.670> HIV<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.840> had

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
Mississippi was cured of HIV that it had

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.580 
Mississippi was cured of HIV that it had
at<00:00:25.140> birth

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
at birth

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
at birth
so<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> deal<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.550> child's<00:00:26.939> mother

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
so the deal is this the child's mother

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.150 
so the deal is this the child's mother
had<00:00:27.390> not<00:00:27.539> received<00:00:27.900> any<00:00:28.140> medical<00:00:28.740> care<00:00:28.980> while

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
had not received any medical care while

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
had not received any medical care while
she<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.490> pregnant<00:00:29.640> she<00:00:30.269> also<00:00:30.390> didn't<00:00:30.810> know

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
she was pregnant she also didn't know

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
she was pregnant she also didn't know
that<00:00:30.929> she<00:00:31.289> had<00:00:31.500> HIV<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.940> means<00:00:33.149> she

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that she had HIV so that means she

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
that she had HIV so that means she
didn't<00:00:33.750> receive<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.110> drugs<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> mother's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
didn't receive the drugs that a mother's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.549 
didn't receive the drugs that a mother's
normally<00:00:35.820> given<00:00:36.000> during<00:00:36.450> pregnancy<00:00:37.050> to

normally given during pregnancy to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.860 
normally given during pregnancy to

kept testing for HIV and after 29 days
there<00:01:18.869> were<00:01:18.960> no<00:01:18.990> detectable<00:01:19.650> signs<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
there were no detectable signs of the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070 
there were no detectable signs of the
virus<00:01:20.369> gone<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.450> kept<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> baby<00:01:21.900> on

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.719 
virus gone they kept the baby on
treatments<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> mother<00:01:23.100> began<00:01:23.280> missing

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
treatments but the mother began missing

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
treatments but the mother began missing
appointments<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.630> 18<00:01:24.780> months<00:01:25.290> old

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
appointments when it was 18 months old
and<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.890> finally<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> test<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> baby

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and they finally got to test the baby

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
and they finally got to test the baby
again<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.570> 23<00:01:28.290> months<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.189> expected<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
again at 23 months and they expected to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.609 
again at 23 months and they expected to
see<00:01:29.939> an<00:01:30.119> uptick<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> virus<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.470> there

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
see an uptick in the virus but there

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
see an uptick in the virus but there
wasn't<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.280> child<00:01:32.520> still<00:01:32.790> tested

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
wasn't one the child still tested

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
wasn't one the child still tested
negative<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> awesome<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
negative so this is awesome right the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.609 
negative so this is awesome right the
virus<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.430> functionally<00:01:36.060> cured<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.350> kid

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
virus was functionally cured in this kid

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
virus was functionally cured in this kid
but<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.310> still<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.670> variables<00:01:39.119> here

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
but there are still some variables here

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.359 
but there are still some variables here
first<00:01:39.570> off<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.710> children<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.189> HIV

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
first off a lot of children with HIV

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.789 
first off a lot of children with HIV
positive<00:01:42.240> parents<00:01:42.600> also<00:01:43.049> test<00:01:43.320> positive<00:01:43.530> for

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
positive parents also test positive for

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
positive parents also test positive for
HIV<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.909> usually<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

infected but that's just something worth

infected but that's just something worth
noting<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.890> second<00:01:56.369> thing<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060

noting the second thing to know is that
this<00:01:57.360> might<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.960> cure<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.829> the

this might not be a cure in the

this might not be a cure in the

on such intense medication so early some

on such intense medication so early some
doctors<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.710> saying<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.340> baby<00:02:05.490> wasn't

the<00:02:07.979> virus<00:02:08.399> didn't<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> chance<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.660> hold

the virus didn't get a chance to hold

the virus didn't get a chance to hold
and<00:02:10.379> build<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.340> what's<00:02:11.580> called<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:12.030> reservoir

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and build up what's called a reservoir

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.940 
and build up what's called a reservoir
and<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:13.020> why<00:02:13.170> experts<00:02:13.560> say<00:02:13.709> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and that's why experts say that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.470 
and that's why experts say that
this<00:02:14.040> breakthrough<00:02:14.370> isn't<00:02:15.000> relevant<00:02:15.150> to

this breakthrough isn't relevant to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
adults with HIV but that still means

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.880 
adults with HIV but that still means
that<00:02:17.760> getting<00:02:18.330> aggressive<00:02:18.660> early<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.470> can

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
that getting aggressive early on can

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.160 
that getting aggressive early on can
stop<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.489> virus<00:02:20.640> from<00:02:20.849> taking<00:02:21.390> hold<00:02:21.629> in<00:02:21.989> a

that this is really gone for good so
