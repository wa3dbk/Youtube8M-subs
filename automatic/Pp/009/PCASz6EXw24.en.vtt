other mega Pokemon that pretty much

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.180

guarantees that we will see a new form
in<00:00:56.660> zygarde<00:00:57.660> probably<00:00:58.350> unlocking<00:00:59.070> his<00:00:59.280> hidden

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
in zygarde probably unlocking his hidden

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.150 
in zygarde probably unlocking his hidden
potential<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.480> believe<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> mega

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
potential I believe we will see a mega

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
potential I believe we will see a mega
just<00:01:02.640> cuz<00:01:02.879> he's<00:01:03.090> hanging<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> bunch

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
just cuz he's hanging around for a bunch

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
just cuz he's hanging around for a bunch
of<00:01:04.409> other<00:01:04.589> mega<00:01:04.890> pokemon<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.150> really

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
of other mega pokemon but we really

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.260 
of other mega pokemon but we really
never<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.439> Nintendo<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.939> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
never know if Nintendo they can really

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
never know if Nintendo they can really
throw<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.350> basically<00:01:10.740> anything<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.369> us

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
throw you know basically anything at us

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
throw you know basically anything at us
the<00:01:12.180> good<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the good thing about this is that in the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.480 
the good thing about this is that in the
future<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.090> probably<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.470> Pokemon<00:01:17.159> Z

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
future we will probably see a Pokemon Z

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.929 
future we will probably see a Pokemon Z
game<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.840> might<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.350> Pokemon<00:01:19.890> XZ<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.729> YZ

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
game well we might see Pokemon XZ and YZ

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.020 
game well we might see Pokemon XZ and YZ
it<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.110> depends<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.850> much

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it really depends on you know how much

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
it really depends on you know how much
money<00:01:24.240> Nintendo<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.170> wants<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> make

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
money Nintendo really wants to make

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.520 
money Nintendo really wants to make
alright<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.180> some<00:01:27.810> pretty<00:01:28.200> good

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
alright so we have some pretty good

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.640 
alright so we have some pretty good
images<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.850> mysterious<00:01:30.360> green<00:01:31.110> blob

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
images of the mysterious green blob

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.370 
images of the mysterious green blob
pokemon<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.390> image<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
pokemon on this image right here it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.520 
pokemon on this image right here it
appears<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.759> running<00:01:36.090> away<00:01:36.530> from

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
appears that it was running away from

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
appears that it was running away from
something<00:01:37.979> possibly<00:01:38.729> indicating<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
something possibly indicating that it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530 
something possibly indicating that it's
an<00:01:40.350> important<00:01:40.979> legendary<00:01:41.610> pseudo<00:01:42.030> legendary

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
an important legendary pseudo legendary

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.319 
an important legendary pseudo legendary
kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.960> Pokemon<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.590> rare<00:01:44.130> Pokemon<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:45.000> least

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
kind of Pokemon a rare Pokemon at least

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.590 
kind of Pokemon a rare Pokemon at least
so<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.380> could<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.680> related<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.399> zygarde<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so it could be related to zygarde in a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.310 
so it could be related to zygarde in a
way<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.520> image<00:01:50.909> over<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:52.049> looks

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
way but on the image over here it looks

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.370 
way but on the image over here it looks
like<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.920> multiple<00:01:53.729> green<00:01:54.149> blob<00:01:54.630> Pokemon

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
like we have multiple green blob Pokemon

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.859 
like we have multiple green blob Pokemon
so<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.790> only<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> its<00:01:57.780> kind

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
so it's not the only one of its kind

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.530 
so it's not the only one of its kind
that<00:01:58.680> makes<00:01:58.950> me<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.549> probably<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that makes me think it's probably not a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.859 
that makes me think it's probably not a
zygarde<00:02:01.350> form<00:02:01.909> probably<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.149> related<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
zygarde form probably not related to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
zygarde form probably not related to
zygarde<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.530> mean<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.950> possible<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.700> have

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
zygarde I mean it is possible we have

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.660 
zygarde I mean it is possible we have
manaphy<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.719> Fiona<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.399> really

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
manaphy and Fiona but it's not really

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.020 
manaphy and Fiona but it's not really
likely<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.750> opinion<00:02:10.170> also<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.550> fact<00:02:11.819> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
likely in my opinion also the fact that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.240 
likely in my opinion also the fact that
we<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.450> multiple

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
we have multiple

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.670 
we have multiple
of<00:02:13.310> them<00:02:13.490> probably<00:02:13.910> indicates<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.500> will

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
of them probably indicates that it will

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.910 
of them probably indicates that it will
not<00:02:15.920> be<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> 7th<00:02:17.060> gen<00:02:17.420> starter<00:02:18.020> Pokemon<00:02:18.650> it

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
not be a 7th gen starter Pokemon it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.300 
not be a 7th gen starter Pokemon it
could<00:02:19.400> still<00:02:19.610> be<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.970> 7th<00:02:20.600> gen<00:02:20.870> pokemon<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:22.160> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
could still be a 7th gen pokemon but the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.850 
could still be a 7th gen pokemon but the
fact<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.700> there's<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.270> many<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.690> them<00:02:23.860> kind

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
fact that there's so many of them kind

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.850 
fact that there's so many of them kind
of<00:02:25.100> puts<00:02:25.370> off<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.610> idea<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:27.590> know<00:02:27.620> it's

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
of puts off the idea that you know it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.230 
of puts off the idea that you know it's
going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> starter<00:02:28.520> he's<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.730> just

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
going to be a starter he's just just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.180 
going to be a starter he's just just
kind<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.510> odd<00:02:29.660> seeing<00:02:30.050> multiple<00:02:30.620> starters<00:02:31.010> in

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
kind of odd seeing multiple starters in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.880 
kind of odd seeing multiple starters in
one<00:02:31.370> frame<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.880> mean<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:33.380> Pokemon

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
one frame I mean in a way this Pokemon

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.770 
one frame I mean in a way this Pokemon
kind<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.520> looks<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.910> Dunsparce<00:02:35.480> it's

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
kind that looks like Dunsparce it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.350 
kind that looks like Dunsparce it's
dirty<00:02:36.290> enough<00:02:36.560> but<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.310> would<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.610> be<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.090> odd

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
dirty enough but it would just be so odd

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.350 
dirty enough but it would just be so odd
basing<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.020> Pokemon<00:02:39.530> off<00:02:40.030> Dunsparce<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.270> know

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
basing a Pokemon off Dunsparce you know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120 
basing a Pokemon off Dunsparce you know
like<00:02:41.660> Dunsparce<00:02:42.200> already<00:02:42.500> has<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> mega<00:02:42.950> and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
like Dunsparce already has a mega and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.160 
like Dunsparce already has a mega and
everything<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.390> first<00:02:44.630> thing<00:02:44.840> i

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
everything you know the first thing i

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.350 
everything you know the first thing i
thought<00:02:45.440> when<00:02:45.680> i<00:02:45.739> saw<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.280> pokemon<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.090> wow

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
thought when i saw this pokemon is wow

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.810 
thought when i saw this pokemon is wow
it<00:02:47.630> really<00:02:47.660> really<00:02:48.650> looks<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.430> tadpole

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
it really really looks like a tadpole

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.110 
it really really looks like a tadpole
like<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.750> like<00:02:51.320> crawls<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.730> looks<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.090> a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
like it like crawls and it looks like a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.510 
like it like crawls and it looks like a
cross<00:02:53.330> at<00:02:53.570> least<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.500> kind<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.830> swims<00:02:55.160> ish

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
cross at least and it kind of swims ish

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.449 
cross at least and it kind of swims ish
and<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:56.209> jumps<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.900> some<00:02:57.140> tadpoles<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:58.070> jump

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
and it jumps and some tadpoles can jump

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.390 
and it jumps and some tadpoles can jump
so<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:59.300> turned<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.200> idea<00:03:00.590> for<00:03:01.160> me

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
so it really turned on that idea for me

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.910 
so it really turned on that idea for me
and<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.690> picture<00:03:03.170> right<00:03:03.320> here<00:03:03.380> it's

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
and in this picture right here it's

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.660 
and in this picture right here it's
green<00:03:04.700> everywhere<00:03:05.360> could<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:06.170> be<00:03:06.530> algae<00:03:07.250> not

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
green everywhere could that be algae not

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.990 
green everywhere could that be algae not
too<00:03:08.060> sure<00:03:08.450> could<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.989> be<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.620> pond<00:03:10.000> maybe

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
too sure could it be in a pond maybe

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.229 
too sure could it be in a pond maybe
probably<00:03:11.570> not<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.430> problem<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.060> this

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
probably not but the problem with this

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.740 
probably not but the problem with this
being<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.810> tadpole<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:16.700> there's<00:03:17.299> so<00:03:17.540> many

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
being a tadpole is that there's so many

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.190 
being a tadpole is that there's so many
frog<00:03:18.260> Pokemon<00:03:18.950> already<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.720> besides

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
frog Pokemon already like but besides

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.259 
frog Pokemon already like but besides
the<00:03:21.440> fact<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.100> swims<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.970> may<00:03:23.209> be

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
the fact that it swims and it may be

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.259 
the fact that it swims and it may be
jumps<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.440> fact<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.010> has<00:03:25.160> one<00:03:25.580> eye<00:03:25.820> and

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
jumps the fact that it has one eye and

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.640 
jumps the fact that it has one eye and
looks<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.049> other<00:03:27.080> eye<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.380> still

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
looks like the other eye is still

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.800 
looks like the other eye is still
developing<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.940> still<00:03:29.269> looks<00:03:29.299> like<00:03:29.660> it's

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
developing and it still looks like it's

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.930 
developing and it still looks like it's
developing<00:03:30.380> as<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.530> Pokemon<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.459> really<00:03:31.670> does

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
developing as a Pokemon it really does

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.090 
developing as a Pokemon it really does
put<00:03:32.299> back<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.840> idea<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> could<00:03:33.650> be<00:03:34.070> a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
put back that idea that it could be a

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.340 
put back that idea that it could be a
tadpole<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.060> at<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.420> end<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.810> day<00:03:36.049> I<00:03:36.080> don't

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
tadpole so at the end of the day I don't

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.860 
tadpole so at the end of the day I don't
think<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:37.010> related<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.430> zygarde<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.360> don't

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
think it's related to zygarde I don't

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.650 
think it's related to zygarde I don't
think<00:03:39.170> it's<00:03:39.860> related<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.519> Dunsparce<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:41.510> I'm

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
think it's related to Dunsparce so I'm

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.720 
think it's related to Dunsparce so I'm
gonna<00:03:41.810> have<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.200> go<00:03:42.380> with<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> notion<00:03:42.950> that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
gonna have to go with the notion that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.080 
gonna have to go with the notion that
this<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> new<00:03:44.810> 7th<00:03:45.380> gen<00:03:45.650> pokemon<00:03:46.090> following

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
this is a new 7th gen pokemon following

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.990 
this is a new 7th gen pokemon following
in<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.480> footsteps<00:03:48.019> of<00:03:48.019> dawn<00:03:48.530> fan<00:03:49.000> Munchlax

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
in the footsteps of dawn fan Munchlax

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.140 
in the footsteps of dawn fan Munchlax
and<00:03:50.540> etc<00:03:50.959> being<00:03:51.590> released<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.160> little<00:03:52.400> early<00:03:52.910> to

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
and etc being released a little early to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.479 
and etc being released a little early to
put<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.570> little<00:03:53.930> bit<00:03:54.350> of<00:03:54.380> interest<00:03:54.920> into<00:03:55.310> the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
put a little bit of interest into the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.140 
put a little bit of interest into the
next<00:03:55.760> generation<00:03:56.390> also<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.530> could<00:03:58.040> be<00:03:58.459> that

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
next generation also it could be that

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.140 
next generation also it could be that
the<00:03:59.209> 6th<00:04:00.049> gen<00:04:00.290> gets<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.890> second<00:04:01.519> half<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.060> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the 6th gen gets a second half to the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.030 
the 6th gen gets a second half to the
pokedex<00:04:02.660> as<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:02.959> guys<00:04:03.110> know<00:04:03.140> we<00:04:03.560> only<00:04:03.799> got

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
pokedex as you guys know we only got
