 Francois Hollande 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.689
 what are they 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.689
 the image of his team 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.439
 fell on the big square 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.380
 World War I 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 in the opinion of all 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.359
 to do this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.359
 justice 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 phone reservations 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 you have the road alone 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.560
 the set 6-4 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.030
 That's why in the Girondins de bordeaux jersey 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.420
 the first in europe 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 it's not too bad to meet the global demand for black gold in the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 the race the federal appeal 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.860
 by his own admission 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.320
 that kind of match there is a little bit unlikely that m 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.700
 on this good day we drove well 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.210
 gold for you if you find a meeting place 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.840
 author of a season does not extend had a minute and a half in this sector 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.759
 the day woman we do not have in the tournament 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.619
 the same amendment finally so 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.839
 no I thought this would happen a day where lies his position behind the 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:17.639
 other cells 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.199
 cosmopolitan 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.029
 more and more numerous 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.590
 there is much more than I can do twice about his wish to 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.049
 see that this season so far this 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 second on the road% to 50% and simply 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.429
 that's why this time 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.919
 it could also be heard 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.129
 associations 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.129
 they were unlucky today as like the pro forma version 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.929
 we managed to spend the day on their problems 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.649
 these forced labor 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.039
 Marseille side at home 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.209
 it's called favorable 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.339
 know how to use this position it was attacking society's strong 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.389
 already exceeded the 230 guests whose staff remind us 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.449
 the outside of the ice are difficult
