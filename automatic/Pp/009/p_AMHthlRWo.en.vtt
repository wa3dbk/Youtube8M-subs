00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.400
 hello people welcome to 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.500
 solid germany austria we 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 We are here in the green heart 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.579
 Germany in beautiful Thuringia 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.500
 a gravel pit and lie around now 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.230
 actually for two days very much 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.929
 successfully lure with our new you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.879
 and the victory was concerned, you also need the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.589
 appropriate feed because she can 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.000
 he is also concerned that the one 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.280
 fish in different 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 Water layers gets so when 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 attack with bodies when fishing with ground 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.960
 lure is the fish forced on the ground 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.219
 to eat in summer months though 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.199
 the water was crap as well 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.120
 after that the ice has risen so 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.609
 It can live absolutely or deeply in the fall 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 make sense or the different ones 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.160
 Search for water layers after fishing 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 and get there to try to 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.149
 to get 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.789
 we will use this little one here 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.399
 spider in orange and black from ours 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.710
 different big buck baits 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.869
 There are also fluri sieren that in the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 night easy because that gives it to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.170
 example in dragonfly type which exists in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.270
 play running but also like that 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 Tadpoles imitate and they are everything 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.229
 The bait ideally offers 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.489
 you then with our new xj 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.069
 inspections 

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:34.050
 that means you can do it here like with 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.670
 a water ball for example too 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.479
 the different depths in the man 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.380
 then the siegburger would like to offer 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.599
 adjust over the roll but that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.920
 then look at us a little later 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.959
 I wanted to be here for the first moment 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 to talk to the feed and 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:52.950
 we use the new euro pact mix 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.649
 the new tract is an attack food 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.410
 a carp cutter is quite special 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.509
 that concerned with the bait they voted 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.000
 is the comes in these handy 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.500
 grüber and actually consists of three 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.629
 I now have two components 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690
 components already mixed together and 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:11.849
 Although the pellets different mile 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.400
 different on driving particles 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.069
 along with our on driving 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.530
 pilots the rice pellets and also the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.780
 unique or unique to me 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.600
 prepared dried insects mix 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.020
 these two forage species 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.569
 mixed together and then with ours 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.880
 remixed this is the wet one 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.680
 component in this mixture 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.290
 churchills consists of 11 30 so 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.220
 liquid protein 1 weidner 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.430
 and yet another one is just that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.440
 250 milliliters also karabag mix bucket 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.310
 Add and then very important two times 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.320
 250 milliliters of water and ideally that 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.940
 water from the waters which one of 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.350
 chosen there is none too 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.350
 ph value shift we have here then 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.070
 same ph just twice 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.840
 then add water to the bucket 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.209
 mix and then about ten minutes 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 let stand until the mix the necessary 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.050
 consistency has a little tip 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 here you still want something in one 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.459
 firmer mix you want firmer feed 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.620
 then balls with the ball 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.069
 maker will show then it recommends 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.489
 another 250 milliliters of water 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.310
 add 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.049
 So this terrorist mix will be something 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.959
 firmer and on the ball something hertha 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.079
 with normal balls so made with 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.560
 our life ball maker with the 4 cm 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.019
 balls can be reached here so distances 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.269
 of 50 60 meter meter lining cutter 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.370
 make the balls harder to reach 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.549
 also good and like 60 and 70 meters 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.650
 For fishing further out the ball 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.350
 maker relatively easy consists of the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.810
 two components is also from aesch 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.590
 patented that means i just go 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.480
 ago for a half by chabad 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.250
 mix or media metrics you like 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.989
 use 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.700
 press.com premiere the feed back 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.609
 on the one hand on the back 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.890
 the other side and the feed is ready 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.530
 bullet and that very special at this 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.510
 tag mix is ​​that it's made up of components 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.640
 is the one through the water layers 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.280
 go up but also out 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.440
 components at the river bottom or 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.660
 sink to the bottom of the water and thus 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.680
 One achieves an incredible lure 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.080
 effect 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.780
 the entire water column and can do so 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.020
 ideal for fishing at the place or to the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.919
 win and thus one 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.770
 get bite 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.539
 it dissolves very quickly on particles 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.830
 climb up are also without it 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.500
 The then on the water surface 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.830
 meet and thus ensures a 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.960
 really absolutely great lures effect 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.259
 small tip to another with these 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.789
 they lure 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.789
 ideally, they do not only fish with you 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.039
 a route with this victory but on 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.620
 234 red depending on how many routes 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.740
 are also allowed on their waters 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.669
 Just set at three routes 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.810
 for example if at 5 meters 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.780
 approach water depth 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.039
 place only park at four meters 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.940
 fifty so almost on the 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.910
 water surface 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.340
 only park a bait set up 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.650
 the one on half the water depth 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.020
 yes and with one you can do something deeper 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.460
 So they have three 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.810
 different depths in which they do it 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.099
 try and if they are then 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.039
 for example, two feet fifty 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:33.580
 deep the first bite just get 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.020
 then every two three routes to this 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.150
 set that's the deep 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.000
 Water layer in which the fish eat 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.030
 and then also generated much much 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.150
 easier to get a bite I shows 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.090
 once again this afloat controller 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.960
 relatively easy the string live through 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.280
 ahead 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.090
 an eighth whirl on it 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.480
 with our 30 then learned that 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.540
 is attached 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.730
 the cord runs through then runs to 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.740
 body of water and ground 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.280
 then the respective one stays with one 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.140
 Apply metal like one 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.240
 Run rick like a running gag 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.370
 so you can then over your role 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.620
 by releasing cord the 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.170
 ideal water depth actually determine 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.850
 very easy and very good to throw 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.850
 because it is not involved
