00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.860 
roles and it's gonna take some of those
roles<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.699> f-18<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> EI<00:01:00.180> six<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
roles like the f-18 and the EI six that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.369 
roles like the f-18 and the EI six that
could<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.530> previously<00:01:02.719> be<00:01:03.719> directly

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
could not previously be directly

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.250 
could not previously be directly
attached<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.430> muon<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> Muse<00:01:06.600> ships<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
attached to the muon the Muse ships and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.640 
attached to the muon the Muse ships and
put<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> new<00:01:08.100> ships<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
put them on the new ships with it so the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
put them on the new ships with it so the
FF<00:01:10.860> has<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> multi-role<00:01:11.700> fighter<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.299> can

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
FF has a multi-role fighter so I can

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.870 
FF has a multi-role fighter so I can
essentially<00:01:13.110> provide<00:01:13.470> any<00:01:14.040> mission<00:01:14.490> set<00:01:14.700> with

essentially provide any mission set with

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
essentially provide any mission set with

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
bottom of be able to do that it's not

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
specifically a fighter aircraft it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.800 
specifically a fighter aircraft it's

this<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.050> most<00:01:24.260> lethal<00:01:24.440> aircraft<00:01:24.980> that's

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
this is the most lethal aircraft that's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.040 
this is the most lethal aircraft that's
been<00:01:25.340> made<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:25.730> far<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.450> very<00:01:26.540> very

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050
