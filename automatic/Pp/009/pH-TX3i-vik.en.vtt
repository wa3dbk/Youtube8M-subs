because their furs are worth 10k apiece
and<00:01:11.420> they're<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:12.900> great<00:01:13.229> experience

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I must even though 91 hunter is my

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
I must even though 91 hunter is my
lowest<00:01:19.229> skill<00:01:19.880> 9100<00:01:20.880> still<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> pretty<00:01:21.600> high

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
lowest skill 9100 still is a pretty high

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.260 
lowest skill 9100 still is a pretty high
level<00:01:22.520> anyways<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.110> first<00:01:25.380> worth<00:01:25.710> 10k

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
level anyways so the the first worth 10k

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.760

and<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.630> did<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> price<00:01:28.020> check<00:01:28.320> against<00:01:28.710> the

derek's and the other ones the D kya
that<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.490> definitely<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> most<00:01:43.009> high<00:01:44.009> value

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399

now<00:02:06.270> i<00:02:06.299> chose<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.899> i<00:02:07.020> believe<00:02:07.320> any<00:02:07.530> logs<00:02:07.799> will

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
now i chose to i believe any logs will

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.339 
now i chose to i believe any logs will
work<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.910> i<00:02:08.940> chose<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.539> use<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> willow<00:02:10.080> logs

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
work so i chose to use the willow logs

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.410 
work so i chose to use the willow logs
because<00:02:10.590> there's<00:02:11.039> cheapest<00:02:11.610> logs<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.120> which

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
because there's cheapest logs that which

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
because there's cheapest logs that which
are<00:02:12.599> available<00:02:12.720> at

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

that saved me a little bit but not the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.620 
that saved me a little bit but not the
biggest<00:02:19.710> deals<00:02:19.980> anyways<00:02:20.760> ran<00:02:21.000> over<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
biggest deals anyways ran over to the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.630

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
use the Turing to get the kites I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.400 
use the Turing to get the kites I
proceeded<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.570> pitfall<00:02:27.570> trap<00:02:27.840> them<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> took

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
proceeded to pitfall trap them it took

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.170 
proceeded to pitfall trap them it took
me<00:02:28.560> about<00:02:28.770> four<00:02:29.190> or<00:02:29.220> five<00:02:29.370> minutes<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.970> prep

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
me about four or five minutes of prep

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.240 
me about four or five minutes of prep
work<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.660> had<00:02:30.900> about<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.440> little<00:02:31.770> over<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.100> half

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
work so I had about a little over a half

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.120 
work so I had about a little over a half
hour<00:02:32.460> remaining<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.500> all<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.860> trappings

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
hour remaining to do all the trappings

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.200 
hour remaining to do all the trappings
and<00:02:36.800> they're<00:02:37.800> there<00:02:38.130> they're<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> pain

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
and they're there they're really a pain

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.130 
and they're there they're really a pain
I<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:40.530> never<00:02:41.220> really<00:02:41.850> realized<00:02:42.030> how<00:02:42.480> much<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
I I never really realized how much of a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.170 
I I never really realized how much of a
pain<00:02:43.410> they<00:02:43.620> actually<00:02:44.040> are<00:02:44.190> they<00:02:44.700> keep<00:02:44.910> getting

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
pain they actually are they keep getting

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.810 
pain they actually are they keep getting
stuck<00:02:45.390> behind<00:02:45.600> rocks<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.520> they're<00:02:47.520> really

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
stuck behind rocks and they're really

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.080 
stuck behind rocks and they're really
not<00:02:48.360> great<00:02:48.660> experience<00:02:49.380> they<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.490> profitable

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
not great experience they are profitable

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.140 
not great experience they are profitable
I'll<00:02:51.570> give<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:53.310> there<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
I'll give them that but there they are a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 
I'll give them that but there they are a
pain<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:54.930> basically<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:56.130> are<00:02:56.370> there's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
pain to do basically you are there's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.210 
pain to do basically you are there's
three<00:02:56.940> pitfalls<00:02:57.600> or<00:02:58.050> serve<00:02:58.350> or<00:02:58.890> because

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
three pitfalls or serve or because

attack you for about 50 damage which I

didn't<00:03:12.090> think<00:03:12.210> would<00:03:12.360> actually<00:03:12.660> be<00:03:12.720> much<00:03:12.930> but

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
didn't think would actually be much but

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.990 
didn't think would actually be much but
it<00:03:13.320> turned<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.740> add<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.490> quite<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.730> bit

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
it turned out to add up to quite a bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.540 
it turned out to add up to quite a bit
actually<00:03:15.510> died<00:03:15.900> at<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.080> end<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> video<00:03:16.590> got

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
actually died at the end the video got

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.190 
actually died at the end the video got
back<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.910> my<00:03:18.030> grave<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.300> looted<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.900> from

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
back to my grave and looted it from

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.070 
back to my grave and looted it from
items<00:03:19.710> back<00:03:19.890> before<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.610> timer<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.090> out<00:03:21.240> but

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
items back before the timer and out but

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080 
items back before the timer and out but
I<00:03:22.230> was<00:03:22.440> actually<00:03:22.620> surprised<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.430> they<00:03:23.670> they

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
I was actually surprised that they they

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.600 
I was actually surprised that they they
hit<00:03:24.330> as<00:03:24.480> often<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:24.960> they<00:03:24.990> do<00:03:25.190> perhaps<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.370> just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
hit as often as they do perhaps I just

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.730 
hit as often as they do perhaps I just
wasn't<00:03:26.820> doing<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:28.140> honest<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.530> wasn't

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
wasn't doing it to be honest I wasn't

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.770 
wasn't doing it to be honest I wasn't
doing<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.370> very<00:03:29.400> good<00:03:29.760> job<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.120> trying<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.630> avoid

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
doing a very good job of trying to avoid

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.570 
doing a very good job of trying to avoid
the<00:03:30.960> hist<00:03:31.170> because<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> did<00:03:31.950> underestimate

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
the hist because I did underestimate

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.920

that<00:03:46.290> they<00:03:46.410> don't<00:03:46.590> always<00:03:46.770> drop<00:03:47.130> their<00:03:47.370> good

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
that they don't always drop their good

fer they always drop big bones and they
about<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.300> don't<00:03:51.540> know<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:51.660> it's<00:03:51.750> about<00:03:51.900> half<00:03:52.110> a
