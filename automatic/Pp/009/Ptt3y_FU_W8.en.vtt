so<00:04:49.729> that's<00:04:49.880> about<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.180> my<00:04:50.330> top<00:04:50.390> 5<00:04:50.690> list<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.990> hope

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
so that's about it my top 5 list I hope

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.800 
so that's about it my top 5 list I hope
you've<00:04:51.289> enjoyed<00:04:51.940> I've<00:04:52.940> only<00:04:53.180> covered<00:04:53.479> both

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
potions in my list today and that's

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.399 
potions in my list today and that's
because<00:04:55.849> potions<00:04:56.780> have<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> few<00:04:57.140> different

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
because potions have a few different

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:58.450 
because potions have a few different
categories<00:04:57.530> now<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.070> there's<00:04:58.250> healing

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
categories now so there's healing

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.360 
categories now so there's healing
potions<00:04:59.060> there's<00:04:59.539> flasks<00:05:00.409> there's<00:05:00.770> also<00:05:00.919> like

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
potions there's flasks there's also like

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
food and stuff like that so I want to

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.620 
food and stuff like that so I want to
maybe<00:05:04.400> save<00:05:04.669> them<00:05:04.849> for<00:05:05.000> another<00:05:05.120> list<00:05:05.390> and

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
maybe save them for another list and

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.899 
maybe save them for another list and
plus<00:05:06.200> buff<00:05:06.380> potions<00:05:06.830> are<00:05:07.039> just<00:05:07.250> easier<00:05:07.849> to

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
plus buff potions are just easier to

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.550 
plus buff potions are just easier to
cover<00:05:08.210> because<00:05:08.419> they<00:05:08.720> mean<00:05:08.870> so<00:05:08.990> much<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.169> me<00:05:09.409> I
