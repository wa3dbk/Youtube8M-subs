 the Claire 9 7 to it 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.999
 the 2 because some lamps parts with the band interaction is on the player 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.340

 That helps you get to a right light four minutes get a hallway 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.220
 for this

 You will find that the material of these two DVDs is very extensive 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.839
 it is so extensive 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.409
 Precht was endeavored 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.990
 stole all the usual scene, however, play 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.980
 techniques 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.020
 to drive on these two DVDs 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.310
 that's why it's quite normal 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.930
 the different things 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.570
 take their time up to seven days falls 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.509
 Franz 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.889
 So let's take the tests showed 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.529
 It is often like that 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.460
 played well rhythmically Part 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.889
 Dr maybe a little too slow 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.810
 sounds better than a hectic one 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.039
 and played Hapag rhythmically is not accurate 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.460
 So let's leave time for each chapter 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.460
 Try to work through it as clean as it gets 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.280
 and then you have to see 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.360

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.090
 nonsensical 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.060
 accordingly
