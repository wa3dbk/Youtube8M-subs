what day and in what class so it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.350 
what day and in what class so it's
pretty<00:01:37.350> easy<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.150> could<00:01:39.299> be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
pretty easy to use but there could be

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.060 
pretty easy to use but there could be
some<00:01:39.630> improvements<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.409> it'd<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.799> nice<00:01:41.040> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
some improvements like it'd be nice if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.060 
some improvements like it'd be nice if
it<00:01:41.310> had<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:42.090> weekly<00:01:42.840> view<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.560> something

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it had like a weekly view or something

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.819 
it had like a weekly view or something
or<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.490> full<00:01:45.149> calendar<00:01:45.450> view<00:01:45.829> because

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
or a full calendar view because

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.850 
or a full calendar view because
sometimes<00:01:47.399> setting<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.600> due<00:01:48.960> dates<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.530> kind

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
sometimes setting the due dates is kind

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.460 
sometimes setting the due dates is kind
of<00:01:49.920> confusing<00:01:50.100> using<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:52.729> method<00:01:53.729> of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
of confusing using the method of

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.580 
of confusing using the method of
scrolling<00:01:55.470> dates<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> windows<00:01:56.640> phone<00:01:56.850> uses

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
scrolling dates that windows phone uses

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
scrolling dates that windows phone uses
because<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:58.920> tough<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.790> what

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
because it can be tough to see what

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
because it can be tough to see what
