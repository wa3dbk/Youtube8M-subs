00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.959 
see the packaging this case is dustproof
its<00:00:42.780> vibration<00:00:43.469> proof<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.190> also<00:00:44.370> splash

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
its vibration proof it's also splash

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.160 
its vibration proof it's also splash
resistant<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.530> fully<00:00:46.800> waterproof<00:00:47.149> but

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
resistant it's not fully waterproof but

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.660 
resistant it's not fully waterproof but
you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> gets<00:00:49.710> wet<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.399> raining

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
or whatnot it is protected and the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
or whatnot it is protected and the
biggest<00:00:54.120> thing<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.079> case<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.710> very

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
biggest thing is that this case is very

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
biggest thing is that this case is very
it<00:00:56.280> has<00:00:56.399> great<00:00:56.670> drop<00:00:57.000> protection<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> can

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it has great drop protection so you can

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
it has great drop protection so you can
pretty<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.170> throw<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> cake<00:00:59.090> throw<00:01:00.090> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
pretty much throw this a cake throw this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
con with this case is that it is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.950 
con with this case is that it is
difficult<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.820> put<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.970> iPhone<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> to

take out so if you need to do that as
far<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.299> docking<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> often<00:01:13.500> probably<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
far as docking it often probably not the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
far as docking it often probably not the
recommended<00:01:15.360> case<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.320> could<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:16.770> option

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
recommended case but could be an option

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.609 
recommended case but could be an option
if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.479> two<00:01:18.750> cases<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.320> you're

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
if you want to have two cases and you're

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
if you want to have two cases and you're
going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.950> used<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> case<00:01:20.790> when

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
going to be used in this case when

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
going to be used in this case when
you're<00:01:21.210> doing<00:01:21.650> different<00:01:22.939> recreational

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you're doing different recreational

activities or for work or whatnot it may
be<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.220> good<00:01:26.580> option<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.119> switch<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.630> between

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
be a good option to switch out between

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.270 
be a good option to switch out between
two<00:01:28.229> cases<00:01:29.090> anyway<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.270> retails<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.280> 4995

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
two cases anyway this retails for 4995

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.069 
two cases anyway this retails for 4995
I'm<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> follow<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.420> directions<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I'm going to follow the directions of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.980 
I'm going to follow the directions of
how<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> iphone<00:01:35.509> inside<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.689> case

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
how to put the iphone inside this case

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
how to put the iphone inside this case
being<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> say<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> little<00:01:38.640> bit

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
being that like I say it is a little bit

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.100 
being that like I say it is a little bit
complex<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.280> pop<00:01:41.549> these

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
complex so to do so you just pop these

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.910 
complex so to do so you just pop these
edges<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:45.079> pop<00:01:46.079> those<00:01:46.470> out

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.950 

and<00:01:49.920> doing<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.940> release<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and doing so will release this that as a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
and doing so will release this that as a
built-in<00:01:52.410> screen<00:01:52.680> protector<00:01:53.250> oxley<00:01:53.640> show

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
built-in screen protector oxley show

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
built-in screen protector oxley show
that<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.390> use<00:01:54.630> here<00:01:54.660> in<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.050> second<00:01:55.440> but<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that in use here in a second but it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
that in use here in a second but it
works<00:01:55.920> well<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:57.120> you<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.390> an<00:01:57.600> exterior

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
works well so you have an exterior

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.550 
works well so you have an exterior
rubber<00:01:58.530> piece<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.480> then<00:02:00.480> inside<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.320> hard

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
rubber piece and then inside it's a hard

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.850 
rubber piece and then inside it's a hard
plastic<00:02:01.830> piece<00:02:02.870> so<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:04.140> tells<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.620> first

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
plastic piece so it tells you to first

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.690 
plastic piece so it tells you to first
fold<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.770> then<00:02:07.770> slip<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
fold these out and then slip in the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
fold these out and then slip in the
iphone<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:10.970> says<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.270> first<00:02:12.630> slip<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.320> this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
iphone and it says to first slip in this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.680 
iphone and it says to first slip in this
side<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.530> buttons<00:02:17.240> meaning<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> volume

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
side with the buttons meaning the volume

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.040 
side with the buttons meaning the volume
buttons<00:02:19.050> or<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> direction<00:02:19.680> say<00:02:21.050> and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
buttons or what the direction say and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.990 
buttons or what the direction say and
then<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.800> kind<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.130> snaps<00:02:23.490> into<00:02:23.820> place

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
then that just kind of snaps into place

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.790 
then that just kind of snaps into place
there<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:26.960> then<00:02:27.960> what<00:02:28.140> you'll<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.770> you'll

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
there and then what you'll do is you'll

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.330 
there and then what you'll do is you'll
just<00:02:29.160> fold<00:02:29.430> these<00:02:29.610> rubber<00:02:29.970> pieces<00:02:30.740> back<00:02:31.740> over

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
just fold these rubber pieces back over

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.770 
just fold these rubber pieces back over
the<00:02:32.520> front<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.510> iphone<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.720> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the front of the iphone and you kind of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.350 
the front of the iphone and you kind of
just<00:02:36.960> have<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.290> secure<00:02:37.680> each<00:02:37.890> piece<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.610> it's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
just have to secure each piece and it's

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.450 
just have to secure each piece and it's
not<00:02:39.570> too<00:02:39.930> difficult<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.280> see

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
not too difficult but here you can see

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.660 
not too difficult but here you can see
that<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.790> does<00:02:41.970> take<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.240> second<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.490> just

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that it does take a second so you just

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.270 
that it does take a second so you just
pull<00:02:44.970> over<00:02:45.000> these<00:02:45.420> rubber<00:02:46.260> pieces<00:02:46.650> over<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
pull over these rubber pieces over the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.310 
pull over these rubber pieces over the
edges<00:02:48.860> like<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:53.370> fit<00:02:53.640> pretty<00:02:53.820> nicely

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
edges like so and they fit pretty nicely

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.620 
edges like so and they fit pretty nicely
there<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.739> works<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.550> then<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
there you go it works well and then the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.110 
there you go it works well and then the
last<00:02:57.780> part<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.410> you'll<00:02:58.739> just<00:02:58.980> probably<00:02:59.850> want

last part is you'll just probably want

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.600 
last part is you'll just probably want

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
to get that on the right side you'll

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.240
