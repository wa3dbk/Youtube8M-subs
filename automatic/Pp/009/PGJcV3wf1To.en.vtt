00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello everyone 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.530
 today I offer you a 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.369
 armed make - up inspired by ariel la 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.500
 little Mermaid 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.670
 if you are interested in knowing how 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.820
 make this makeup 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.509
 stay tuned to create the pattern 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.669
 scales 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.279
 I use a cooking grid that I have 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.350
 bought at dollarama and that I cut in 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.329
 a smaller format with a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.940
 interference an interference is a 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.490
 product that is activated with water and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.630
 which gives a pearl created finish and 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.880
 multidimensional to replace 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.680
 the widely used interference a powder 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.050
 mad of lise wathier in color 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.650
 white madness or makeup base 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.650
 white 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.400
 we will now add some 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.770
 color starting with a turquoise 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.570
 enough land we will apply in the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.570
 outer part of the face 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.479
 we will now apply the most beautiful 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.070
 color in my opinion the dark green bria which 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 will make them a nice transition with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.400
 the turquoise applied and we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 pay a little more inward 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.350
 of the face 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.149
 then we continue transition goes the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.149
 most colors with a moss green 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 to go for a nice gradient a little 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.810
 our face and the green moss on 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.979
 uses a neutral pearl pigment and well 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.440
 sure the final touch 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.179
 and add a brial powder by the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.770
 music website 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.750
 then we can remove the grid and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.090
 you will see the good reason for the cays 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.659
 we write with a simple grid 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.659
 baking 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.100
 to start we define the eyebrow 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.720
 of course ariel go on six red 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.030
 since she has red hair 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.369
 we will go and define our sources 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.070
 with a red lip pencil 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.260
 be careful the texture is not the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.580
 same as a normal eyebrow pencil so 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.200
 its tendency to expand 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:25.480
 a little bit everywhere on the face and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 since the texture of the lip pencil 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.910
 was so creamy I decided to 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.460
 fix my worries with a red powder 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.050
 that I found in a palette of 88 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.050
 shots there two beefy sitting 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.610
 we are now applying a base on our 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.690
 eyelids so that we believe stone 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 hold on longer 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.880
 I use a pearly white base since 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.770
 when we look at pictures of ariel she 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.990
 is not really eye makeup is 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.870
 sees that eyelid and rather white 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.900
 and the license will give an effect of three 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.900
 dimensions to our eyes look 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.540
 to bring out the white more 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.730
 I apply a white eye shadow 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.790
 rose above the appropriate base 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.680
 to apply I'm now using a 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.500
 pale brown eye shadow with a 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.030
 brush 210 mac sites in the hollow 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.430
 from my eye to add some 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.700
 depth and dimension to my 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.700
 look 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.390
 I use the same envelope in the trap 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.020
 with a flat brush on the line 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.290
 home 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.360
 imperial we are now using a pencil 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.710
 white inside the eye for 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.830
 enlarge our look 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.190
 and to add a character look 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.320
 cartoons to our eyes 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.810
 now we apply a line in the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.970
 night on the stage of our upper lashes 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.310
 it is very important that there is no 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.130
 white space between this line is the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.740
 root of your lashes also we finish 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.450
 this line with a regular tip 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.970
 since some we look at photos 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.890
 of ariel she is not a point 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.730
 lengthened as we sometimes see in the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.730
 pin-up style looks 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.080
 if you want to buy even more 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.959
 definition to your look will go 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.010
 use a black pencil on the line of 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.050
 lower lashes 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.730
 mr wearing to apply a very pressure 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.760
 already since we do not want a very look 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.370
 intense 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.930
 afterwards we fade this line with 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.870
 the same in low brown eyelids that 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.510
 had used just now I have a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.460
 stung my mascara and fossils and 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.560
 while the fossil collar colla 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.720
 I decided to add a few small ones 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.940
 extras these brilliant you just 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.280
 to see on the screen that I got myself 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.350
 to the dollar to man I apply them a little 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.150
 little everywhere on my scales with some 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.150
 faustin glue that dries transparent 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.249
 now our students 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.840
 of course we reuse the same pencil 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.909
 lips that just now but we 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.340
 the church since the subject in my 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.979
 worry I applied it to the knife and I 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.449
 also fill any malev so that the 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.860
 lipstick and a pigment more 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.860
 intense and longer hold 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.290
 I use a red lipstick with 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.060
 a little bit of a raspberry loss for 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.600
 go get the hair color 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.600
 rear

 if you want to buy volume is 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.039
 even more intensity to your lips 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.389
 you can go to cucq and a gloss by 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.789
 on your lipstick 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.099
 I used a red gloss with a 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:04.149
 tinge of rosÃ© to fetch the 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:06.550
 pink of my blush thereafter 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.229
 I used white eye shadow 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.300
 rosie we used on my 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.610

 center of mans time 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:28.410
