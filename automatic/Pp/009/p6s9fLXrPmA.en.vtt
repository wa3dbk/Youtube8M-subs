 good I leave you with the video I prepared my 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.580
 face with this foundation for makeup and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.580
 with this world 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.520
 first I put a base for shadows on 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.520
 all my eyelids 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.059
 I took the little room tone Cafecito 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.059
 these shadows 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.010
 and me so it's like making a 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.010
 triangulito by the outside 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 then with my brush to blur 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.980
 decision of all those lines very 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980
 checked 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.590
 when it was completely blurred 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.090
 I added a little more of the brown tone this 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 to give depth to my eye 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.090
 ah 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.079
 Y 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.220
 do not 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.700
 again I got rid of the lines very 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 checked 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.580
 apply a bit of the same tone of the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.330
 part of the center outward in the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.330
 body of inferior 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.070
 I took some powder to use my face 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.490
 and apply it in the first half of my 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.490
 Upper eyelid 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.340
 then with the clearest tone of my 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.580
 Shadow quartet apply a little 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.890
 right under my old girl near me 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.130
 lachrymal and extended until reaching the tone 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.130
 coffee 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.440
 the security to blur very well for 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 that was made super soft with a brush 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.600
 flat tam in brown tone and fill in my 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.600
 eyebrows 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 line well attached to my eyelashes 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.260
 making a small list with one color 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.260
 black 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.090
 then apply a lot of mask for 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.090
 all my lashes 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.480
 weather 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.760
 and then I put some dust all 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.760
 my face 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.940
 ah 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.940
 and a little blush in a soft pink tone 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.170
 then pass the brush that you use with me 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.360
 dust all over my face so that it 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.250
 they will mix the colors to finish 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.250
 apply on my lips a pink tone 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.860
 and that's it, I got some smoky eyes 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.860
 super soft 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.040
 for the look number 2 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.500
 I started applying base for shadows 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.390
 on all my eyelids 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 two 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.440
 then to sink the tone copper for all my 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.440
 mobile eyelid to reach the basin 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.880
 then apply the brown tone as doing 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.120
 a peak and I made sure to blur it very 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.120
 all right 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.660
 to illuminate take the tone more clearly and 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.080
 I applied it just below my eyebrow and for 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.080
 the animal 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.850
 ah 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.819
 then I took my copper coffee tone and what 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.819
 I said for the lower lid 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.820
 again they have delineated very 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.000
 Delgadito and apply mask for 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.000
 tabs 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.970
 apply the same rumor and the same lip 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.690
 and this time I put some of my shadow 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.870
 clarita over my nose for my 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.910
 cheekbones 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.720
 and a little bit on my lips to 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.720
