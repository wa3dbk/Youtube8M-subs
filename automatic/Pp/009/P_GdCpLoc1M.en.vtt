00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.800
 well i have been asked for help 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.470
 and I found that the end was near 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.550
 the drip is a pronounced migration 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:13.329
 10 people with 27 time span 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.649
 is right 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.829
 and with the idea behind it 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.579
 first that 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.230
 God 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.909
 therefore disapproves of sexuality homosexuality is nothing to it 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.460
 the innate 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 a group makes 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.579
 makes petrov ophthalmologist in routes but no problem 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.720
 and if you have homosexual feelings 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.070
 then that's because 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 something that happens is something traumatic 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.140
 in your life 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.220
 develop homosexual feelings points 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.280
 so far example if you 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 if someone has had a bad relationship with your father 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.360
 a van father failed in the example 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.580
 to be the man 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.859
 centuries you are 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.830
 more focused on, among others 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 can only play a significant role in the initiative 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 de nos, for example, had sexualized puberty 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 five homosexual feelings to be gay 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 how does it work 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390
 anonymous 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.230
 that's what Bible studies say 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.920
 the for the texts discussed among other things to demonstrate that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.690
 homosexuality without learners 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.620
 but also strange 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.520
 osn 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 indicate how you can deal with this 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.479
 An example is if you have homosexuals and thoughts 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.620
 the idea is then to renew the mind 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 and that is based on texas retro to celebrate a party 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.680
 renew the spirits 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.360
 so if you are a nice guy who buy 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.819
 to them 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.819
 to buy off the thoughts of going to prayer 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.359
 take the distance from 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.680
 and now to think of something else or give it to the group in prayer 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.599
 how do I look back on it 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.069
 I know him 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.069
 it a very heavy one 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.549
 therapy found is going back to 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.579
 traumatic moments 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.219
 and as a side effect also that mine also deteriorated the place of the parents 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.139
 because 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.010
 a surplus is put on 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.549
 but yeah 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.419
 that relationship with your parents a 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.249
 and involuntary 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.249
 you start to no longer be blaming your parents 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.010
 I think that can never be the intention 9 hukker 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.109
 therapy 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.769
 it was also a tough thing to be denying yourself all the time 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.539
 are not gay you are 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.109
 a heterosexual 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.159
 with coincidental gay feelings 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.179
 what I find strange actually 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.319
 but in retrospect 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.319
 beh the idea behind when is now against 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.679
 After it makes up and men and women are a man and a woman for each other 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.739
 intended 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.060
 and that looks guilty and had genesis, but it also says it 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.599
 is not good that the man alone in 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.990
 and that is very explicit 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.490
 table and nothing is actually said about homosexual relationships or what 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.870
 also 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.459
 in genesis 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.669
 it is strange that the bath 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.279
 is implicit 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.239
 a 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.909
 or where no ticket for collapse genesis at all 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.510
 the first bible book about homosexuality would go that way 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.980
 it is important that young people are built there in the debate and 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.609
 but Chris had come was constantly pointed out 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.519
 while 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.519
 a very explicit clear passage 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.549
 Bayern also does not state that people are alone 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.229
 no one has selling it there 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.299
 on the contrary 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.750
 years in those therapies you are taught and also in churches 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.900
 that it has become better and to get it better than it is 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.510
 live celibate 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.819
 then stay alone in life 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.419
 both very clearly written that it is not good that god does it 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.729
 does not like that people will borrow it I find it strange that there 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.639
 such an emphasis is also placed on something that is not so certain
