00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.080
 apartments in the middle of the lonely

 paper man begins precisely 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.469
 here when a silent worker walks by 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.509
 one of the hallways of the unit and its 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.520
 luck changes forever when crossing 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.900

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.020
 it served for the paper man it went 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.020
 forever 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.110
 nothing more to clarify the voice 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.260
 the sevilla ninja look is lost in 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.630
 the misty landscape of a neighborhood 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 old railroad we are in the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.760

 from this point of the city a 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.990
 important road to the metropolitan area 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.990
 with its suburban train 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.490
 the images seem to show a city 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.040
 from another country like New York or 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.900

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.879
