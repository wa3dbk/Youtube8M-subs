00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.680
 the kids welcome to a new 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.940
 village design video this time 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.090
 Town hall level 5 farming style 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.190
 and good this time the video is a little 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.360
 different I will put the theme of the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.910
 construction of how it is built 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.550
 fast camera without comments and once 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.980
 finish the fast camera already commented a 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.800
 little bit like the base is worth the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 what is basically 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.599
 and good starts the lyon 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 do not 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.290
 well it's already basically created 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.769
 this is this is the basis of pharming and it goes 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.909
 the title of a wall place and we started 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.030
 to comment as the basics of a base 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.609
 pharming is to have the warehouses 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.200
 in the center is worth and the town hall 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.130
 outside 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.400
 the good thing about this farming base 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 or maybe not so good 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.590
 is that the city council is also 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.110
 pretty protected and apart from 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.939
 disease what we will get from this 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.579
 way is to remove glasses that we 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.890
 give shield but do not take away 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.200
 not many drinks because not all 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.959
 sometimes they will not include it so to the people 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.790
 that you are interested in farmar but that you do not 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.189
 I'm very interested in going down 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.319
 stable to family time will come 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.319
 very good everyone to comment 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.510
 the mortar of the mahler center as you see 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:26.020
 in the radio it affects the whole village 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.800
 the cannons the canyons here where 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.090
 want here the anti-aircraft accepts almost 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.740
 the whole base if they come up here up 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.620
 you will know enough or just 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.080
 with destroying this 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.049
 and he 's young enough but hey well 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.450
 usually attack many times by air 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.390
 in these levels the clan castle 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.769
 out here, maybe I do not like it that much 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.930
 I always like to center it even if 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.490
 a farming type unit in the castle 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.720
 so always inside to protect you 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.460
 but good in this in this case I do not know I 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.250
 I think that will be fine with the mortar 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.730
 here in the center 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.800
 I think it's going pretty good and good 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.170
 everything else as you can see here 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.000
 they were at tuntun the buildings outside 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.180
 basically to hinder the troops 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.180
 enemies 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.170
 the tower of wizards here to protect 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.600
 to the mortar in case they come in, it's worth 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.980
 they feel in the red radius the mortar not 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.990
 can protect himself 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.820
 to the towers and the canyons this is 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.110
 Protecting tornadoes from mortar 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.110
 Everything is protected against each other 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.410
 and little more than commenting on the aerial mines 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.000
 here are all the traps together worth 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.729
 by itself because usually they usually enter 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.439
 for the town hall ' 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.740
 so for that they have been placed here 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:48.740
 all the traps and camps that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.110
 they are the hardest buildings to destroy 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.900
 at these levels 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.160
 and well I think that I hope that 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.070
 you liked this design style 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.800
 from the town hall level 5 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.510
 if you liked to like it and we 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.510
 We see in the following video until then
