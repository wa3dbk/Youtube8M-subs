 hello youtube friends, good note that 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.519
 Something very sad happens to me in my perfume of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.200
 prada broke me and when it broke 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.090
 against these three things 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 and things are not 3 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 etc one can not be the cap they do not bump 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 can not be harmed been the cutest 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.600
 and I discovered one thing in my previous video 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.500
 the mansion of the barbie is a clock with 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.030
 all things and a paper circle I 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.030
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.380
 very well let's leave all the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.510
 materials are reached I will leave these 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.690
 two for this I need a prada perfume 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.760
 so there's a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.449
 a little thing like a bracelet looks like a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.040
 proceed and this little thing that says stop 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.659
 up he also says now then what 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.920
 let's put here 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.500
 it should not be 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.320
 here I will put it like that and put it on and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.340
 now it was like that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.230
 very well it looks very good 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.160
 Now let's say that nothing 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 we paste this and this and we go where everything 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.870
 this first let's put this this 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.410
 name of quilÃ­n 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:51.710
 which in this case is white here in 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:55.119
 name so that the letters do not know I do not know 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.710
 I do not know do not develop this little thing 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.560
 because as it broke then they go 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 xerez very well now this little thing 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.280
 we are going to put a hole here 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.679
 Huequito very well 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.870

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.800
 and here this is this we are going to put 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.800
 here 30 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.340
 and then we are going to form a clock here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.250
 a little circle let's take a sheet of 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.010
 paper 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.659
 and this silicon I'm going to put it 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.330
 let's get better already and here with a 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.050
 pencil we take all the measure and we wish 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.500
 a circle 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.100
 and we cut it out I already have my circle 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.060
 cut out of white now picks up the pen 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.400
 and I do the little things about the numbers 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.269
 and everything and a stage 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.790
 I put it in its place once 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:11.860
 we put the lid here in its place and that 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:16.689
 we already put the numbers and everything here the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.319
 we look at and in this many expansion 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:24.640
 letters and according to the letters we place the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:29.490
 number 12 up and we place it 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.580
 here in the center and look now 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.250
 and we can turn it because this one is left 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.050
 a little bit that the same remains super 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.710
 cool 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.820
 because look 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.000
 that the cool and they can place it in 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.580
 any toy house or something 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.190
