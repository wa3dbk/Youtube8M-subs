00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.440
 the scope of delivery of the BF 70 with integrated floor drain is one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.859
 slide sleeve and then rust 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.200
 the use of the train 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.759
 I explain just when installing 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.909
 Before starting the installation, follow the installation instructions thoroughly 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.949
 First I have to prepare the b70 and Massa manages the process 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.050
 in this case it is 8 cm I transfer that from port 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.460
 do not forget the included long 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.800
 Remove hooves 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.980
 then I can look the Rorschach either applications or a jigsaw 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.540
 Now the portfolio continues to be used 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 in the long just be used by the US to the string 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 and then when the drainpipes are made to fit 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.820
 finish there and finish the edge of the strip 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.610
 so as not to be in the pressure of time 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.840
 Ulrich now where one third of the professional field quickly tackles topic 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 the last third of Brownie later 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.979
 I will be wearing 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.069
 Professional Flex foursome with a number of falls of 8 millimeters on the ground 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.980
 on 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.940
 then I carry the tile adhesive on the back of the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 Boats up 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.290
 To achieve optimal soundproofing I can pair the shells 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 smart process there, the BF 70 is fixed with four points 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 now the b70 has started 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 Â«Shaken and controlled with the spirit level 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.040
 the element can now be walked on after about three hours 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.440
 the GF 70 is now connected to the drain system and the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.780
 Leakage tests are carried out 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 the drainpipe is provided with a soundproof wall chute 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.660
 the completion-sause emptying provides additional sound insulation 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.360
 now I would pay the last quarter of profit 6 0 4 and hope so 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.160
 Process 8 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.080
 before I can touch the intention of mass cutting all the donors too 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.319
 now to a step that needs special care 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.700
 I would dense the KMK SchlÃ¤mmer 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.699
 and start laying them down 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.699
 the seal will continue the wall and floor conclusion 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 do not pay special attention to the drain shaft 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.789
 "Here I am laying the donors after the find of 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.739
 after linguistically I'm using it by drying the first layer 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.979
 Karstadt no longer detectable 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.569
 the installation of the b 70 is now finished and the system can be ready the next day 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.199
 pledged
