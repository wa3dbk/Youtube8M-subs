00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.949
 eating less meat is becoming common in the Netherlands 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 how the meat on their plate really looks like 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.199
 always eat meat is very little and it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.659
 was so little of me I thought yes 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.519

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.120
 now for your year i love meat 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.729

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.870
 yes actually because I feel sorry 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.460
 I did try to be honest not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 a lot of compassion or something I think 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.430
 also don't bother with me when i am here now 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 would see a piglet and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 someone would anoint a device very much 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.140
 for the animals 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880
 the way they are treated 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.060
 become like that landed on your plate 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.010
 dislikes me and also environmentally 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 how much do you think is important to 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 don't know where your meat comes from 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.620
 important as hunger and then I really 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.850
 all to be honest not but 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.520
 example to be a faith al dente 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.900
 what is the difference they leave those animals 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.760
 hope to have freedom of life when they 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.369
 they are eaten they say so on that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.350
 moment sex they also say such 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 would like to be grape and then be 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.640
 them if you choose not to have meat 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 eat on him meat eat this own pro 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.259
 must know where it comes from 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.650
 this is important to know the logo 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.210
 is say and not further 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.210
 that a horse gets that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.080
 do n't you really think about it yes i do 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.380
 translation Well sometimes I buy aware 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.870
 organic 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.460
 meat because you know who know 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.200
 nowadays that is sprayed full 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.310
 a novel also a so-called biological 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.080
 for this but you can not forget that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.400
 believe if it is really organic 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.840
 you it is also important to know us 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.240
 sticks to evening 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 yes sometimes occasionally no that does not seem 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.590
 agree on a disaster that was advice out of it 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 see he is a kind of a would 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.190
 through the head of one 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.530
 from and then something like that I don't know exactly 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.740
 yes that always in my mouth no why 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.460
 not 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.620
 no this is the assemble the odor sheep 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.640
 the see no not because it is really pathetic 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.650
 is only because it is just the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.660
 I think worked bloody choose salt and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.190
 then i think it's just pure something 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.200
 human is that you'd rather just not 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.160
 look at what happens but I notice 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.780
 just on one 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.480
 well i dont mind they have 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.220
 ago but if I don't know anything about it 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.800
 then it doesn't matter why would you do that 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.210
 not win I see know I can not 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.250
 against blood, let alone me 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.510
 I watch how an animal slept with 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.220
 little hypocritical because merciless too 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.930
 just find it while you want 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.520
 enjoy the week it also becomes one 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.650
 little coward i mean know you should know 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.480
 where we were commercial today 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.150
 safely is somewhere in the bush you have 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.410
 no food and one just runs out 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.180
 I am not going to call animals because blade 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.740
 walk around her an animal walks past 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.130
 and you must eat 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.320
 yes yes that was thought about and that would 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.070
 I do that I would agree that I would 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.630
 better 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.310
 it belongs to nature because in the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.350
 nature also eats animals there too 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.780
 on and so so why should I be whole 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.130
 be happy when people do n't eat 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.280
 seems a free always to me 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.360
 I think eating meat is different 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.550
 food no longer tasty 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.330
 as long as I know where it came from 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.330
 stay tinted
