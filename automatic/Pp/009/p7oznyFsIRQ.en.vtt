turn on other game this is Burnley and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
turn on other game this is Burnley and
that's<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.439> there's<00:00:19.590> no<00:00:19.680> doubt<00:00:19.859> about

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that's it because there's no doubt about

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
that's it because there's no doubt about
it<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.520> deserve<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> point<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.539> today

it you deserve to point out there today
yeah<00:00:22.199> exactly<00:00:22.289> i<00:00:22.710> think<00:00:22.949> specially<00:00:23.369> after

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
yeah exactly i think specially after

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.990 
yeah exactly i think specially after
first<00:00:24.480> off<00:00:24.689> after<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.859> score<00:00:26.160> goal<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
first off after the score goal we have a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.140 
first off after the score goal we have a
brilliant<00:00:27.390> reaction<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:29.250> press<00:00:29.640> them<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
brilliant reaction and we press them and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.490 
brilliant reaction and we press them and
we<00:00:30.630> show<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.470> play<00:00:33.079> like<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.290> same

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
we show that we can play like on same

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
we show that we can play like on same
level<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.059> Chelsea<00:00:36.059> who<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
level like Chelsea who is one of the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.470 
level like Chelsea who is one of the
best<00:00:36.930> teams<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.450> should

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
best teams and and I think we should

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
best teams and and I think we should
maybe<00:00:39.989> score<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:40.710> goal<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.070> 1st<00:00:41.309> half

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
maybe score one more goal in 1st half

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.030 
maybe score one more goal in 1st half
2nd<00:00:42.090> half<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.690> difficult<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.290> they

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
2nd half was more difficult because they

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.880 
2nd half was more difficult because they
they<00:00:44.840> attack<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.710> more

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
they attack more and there was more

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889 
they attack more and there was more
difficult<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.399> us<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:48.120> important<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
difficult for us how important was that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
difficult for us how important was that
quick<00:00:49.320> reaction<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:50.969> important

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
quick reaction was really important

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
quick reaction was really important

qualities<00:01:53.579> well<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.180> worried<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.540> any<00:01:54.659> stage

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
qualities well you worried at any stage

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
qualities well you worried at any stage
those<00:01:55.229> chances<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> had<00:01:56.040> had<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> first

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
those chances you had had in the first

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.209 
those chances you had had in the first
half<00:01:56.820> might<00:01:57.180> come<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> haunt<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.219> not

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
half might come back to haunt you not

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.889 
half might come back to haunt you not
worried<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.540> easy<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
worried but it would be more easy that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.260 
worried but it would be more easy that
we<00:02:01.049> score<00:02:01.290> goals<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.210> these<00:02:03.210> just

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
we score goals you know and these just

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.120 
we score goals you know and these just
give<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.899> trust<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.890> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.069 
give you trust that you can get more
chances<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.210> second<00:02:06.540> half<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.960> was

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
chances and the second half really was

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.499 
chances and the second half really was
all<00:02:07.229> about<00:02:07.409> defending<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.369> showing<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.479> much

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
all about defending and showing so much

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.110 
all about defending and showing so much
resilience<00:02:10.200> yes<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.099> think<00:02:11.340> we

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
resilience yes I think we

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240 
resilience yes I think we
were<00:02:12.209> too<00:02:12.659> much<00:02:12.840> focused<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.440> defending

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
were too much focused in defending

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.270 
were too much focused in defending
because<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.140> first<00:02:16.440> half<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.890> replay

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
because you see in first half and replay

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.080 
because you see in first half and replay
four<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.090> five<00:02:18.239> passes<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.260> were<00:02:19.409> immediately

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
four or five passes we were immediately

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.899 
four or five passes we were immediately
dangerous<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:22.860> second<00:02:23.340> healthy<00:02:23.700> means

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
dangerous and in second healthy means

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.660 
dangerous and in second healthy means
that<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.590> even<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.159> some<00:02:26.340> chances

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
that but even then we have some chances

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.610 
that but even then we have some chances
but<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.909> Chelsea<00:02:27.450> was<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.780> battering<00:02:28.200> second

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
