00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you can see it looks pretty effective

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670

not a lot of bullet drop on there much
faster<00:01:02.129> firing<00:01:02.399> probably<00:01:03.030> pretty<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.480> for

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
faster firing probably pretty good for

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660

getting shot at by the ac-130 and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.749 
getting shot at by the ac-130 and
thinking<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.579> gonna

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
thinking you know what I'm just gonna

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
thinking you know what I'm just gonna
flap<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.450> take<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> gunship

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
flap there and take out this gunship

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
flap there and take out this gunship
well<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> didn't<00:01:44.310> work<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.909> well<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
well that didn't work out so well I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.179 
well that didn't work out so well I
started<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.840> gain<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.049> altitude<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
started to gain some altitude and then I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
started to gain some altitude and then I
noticed<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.060> how<00:01:48.689> high<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> gunship<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.770> in

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
noticed just how high the gunship was in

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
noticed just how high the gunship was in
the<00:01:50.100> sky<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> realized<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.899> don't<00:01:52.020> think

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the sky and realized that I don't think

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
the sky and realized that I don't think
I<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.619> actually<00:01:52.740> even<00:01:53.070> fly<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.579> high<00:01:53.909> enough

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
I can actually even fly up high enough

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.420 
I can actually even fly up high enough
to<00:01:54.750> deal<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.350> gunship<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.100> not

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to deal with this gunship I'm not

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.249 
to deal with this gunship I'm not
confirming<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> helicopter<00:01:57.360> can't<00:01:58.020> kill

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
confirming that a helicopter can't kill

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.200 
confirming that a helicopter can't kill
a<00:01:58.290> gunship<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.790> didn't<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.149> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a gunship but I just didn't want to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
a gunship but I just didn't want to
spend<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.570> amount<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.899> time<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> took<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
spend the amount of time that it took to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.459 
spend the amount of time that it took to
fly<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.850> altitude<00:02:03.149> level<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.869> test<00:02:04.290> out

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
fly up to the altitude level to test out

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.560 
fly up to the altitude level to test out
that<00:02:04.500> theory<00:02:05.009> again<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.610> only<00:02:05.759> had<00:02:05.939> 15<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> 20

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that theory again we only had 15 to 20

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.510 
that theory again we only had 15 to 20
minutes<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.110> play<00:02:07.320> battlefield<00:02:07.890> 4<00:02:08.160> at<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> time

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
minutes to play battlefield 4 at a time

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
minutes to play battlefield 4 at a time
and<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.119> felt<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.539> time

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and I felt like my time

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.559 
and I felt like my time
have<00:02:10.439> spent<00:02:10.739> been<00:02:11.189> spent<00:02:11.459> better<00:02:11.760> doing<00:02:12.239> other

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
about to come down and it is neat to

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.229 
about to come down and it is neat to
bail<00:03:40.500> out<00:03:40.650> from<00:03:40.859> so<00:03:41.099> high<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.669> sky<00:03:41.849> I

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
bail out from so high up in the sky I

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.569 
bail out from so high up in the sky I
paused<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.079> because<00:03:43.410> -<00:03:43.440> crow<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.160> still

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
paused it here because - crow is still

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.129 
paused it here because - crow is still
very<00:03:44.910> high<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.329> in<00:03:45.449> the<00:03:45.510> sky<00:03:45.690> while<00:03:46.019> he's

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
very high up in the sky while he's

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.020 
very high up in the sky while he's
parachuting<00:03:46.799> hired<00:03:47.099> then<00:03:47.340> pretty<00:03:47.639> much<00:03:47.819> all

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
parachuting hired then pretty much all

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.849 
parachuting hired then pretty much all
the<00:03:48.120> skyscrapers<00:03:48.389> except<00:03:49.079> for<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.319> C<00:03:49.620> point

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
the skyscrapers except for the C point

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.729 
the skyscrapers except for the C point
skyscraper<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.449> gunship<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:52.019> very<00:03:52.319> small

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
skyscraper and the gunship is very small

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.159 
skyscraper and the gunship is very small
up<00:03:53.040> there<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.489> was<00:03:53.760> way<00:03:54.239> above<00:03:54.659> his<00:03:54.870> current

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
up there it was way above his current

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.990 
up there it was way above his current
location<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.859> this<00:03:56.010> gives<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.310> an<00:03:56.430> idea<00:03:56.579> of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
location so this gives you an idea of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.569 
location so this gives you an idea of
just<00:03:57.030> how<00:03:57.870> high<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.230> gunship<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.859> in<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.430> air

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
just how high the gunship is in the air

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.039 
just how high the gunship is in the air
and<00:03:59.879> even<00:04:00.209> when<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.510> was<00:04:00.690> flying<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
and even when I was flying the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.589 
and even when I was flying the
helicopter<00:04:01.139> above<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.400> C<00:04:02.609> point<00:04:02.909> skyscraper

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
helicopter above the C point skyscraper

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.619 
helicopter above the C point skyscraper
the<00:04:04.109> gunship<00:04:04.500> was<00:04:04.560> still<00:04:04.980> way<00:04:05.489> above<00:04:05.790> me<00:04:06.269> so

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
the gunship was still way above me so

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.199 
the gunship was still way above me so
this<00:04:06.840> thing<00:04:07.079> is<00:04:07.260> much<00:04:07.709> much<00:04:08.280> higher<00:04:08.519> than<00:04:09.090> it

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
this thing is much much higher than it

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.879 
this thing is much much higher than it
has<00:04:09.239> been<00:04:09.629> in<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.989> other<00:04:10.079> battlefield<00:04:10.620> games

what has also been under discussion is

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.430 
what has also been under discussion is

you take down again shit as I said
before<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.980> seems<00:04:16.190> like<00:04:16.340> it'd<00:04:16.489> be<00:04:16.640> really<00:04:16.820> hard

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
before it seems like it'd be really hard

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.699 
before it seems like it'd be really hard
to<00:04:17.150> take<00:04:17.300> one<00:04:17.510> down<00:04:17.630> with<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> helicopter<00:04:18.110> just

to take one down with a helicopter just
the<00:04:18.860> just<00:04:19.459> because<00:04:19.610> how<00:04:19.850> long<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.239> takes<00:04:20.450> to

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540

don't know if this is going to be in the
final<00:04:29.300> game<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:30.320> far<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.710> seems<00:04:30.950> like<00:04:31.310> they're

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
final game so far it seems like they're

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.910 
final game so far it seems like they're
kind<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:32.060> still<00:04:32.870> designing<00:04:33.470> things<00:04:33.650> in

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
kind of still designing things in

kind of still designing things in
battlefield<00:04:34.400> 4<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:35.030> we'll<00:04:35.480> see<00:04:35.690> how<00:04:35.840> hard<00:04:36.080> it

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
battlefield 4 so we'll see how hard it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.570 
battlefield 4 so we'll see how hard it
is<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.410> take<00:04:36.710> him<00:04:36.890> down<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.310> if<00:04:37.400> they

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
is to take him down and if they

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.180 
is to take him down and if they
disappear<00:04:37.910> once<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.570> exchange<00:04:39.380> see<00:04:39.710> flag<00:04:40.010> in

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
wanted to ask you guys and maybe start a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.320 
wanted to ask you guys and maybe start a
discussion<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.400> do<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:46.820> really<00:04:47.120> want

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
discussion on this do you really want

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.600 
discussion on this do you really want
the<00:04:47.510> c-130<00:04:48.080> gunship<00:04:48.500> back<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.160> game<00:04:49.340> I

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
the c-130 gunship back in the game I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.630 
the c-130 gunship back in the game I
know<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:50.240> had<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:51.200> had<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.410> pretty<00:04:51.770> rough

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
know it had a it had a pretty rough

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.720 
know it had a it had a pretty rough
start<00:04:53.180> with<00:04:53.390> battlefield<00:04:53.930> 3<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:54.980> I<00:04:55.430> still

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
start with battlefield 3 and I still

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.220 
start with battlefield 3 and I still
don't<00:04:55.910> think<00:04:55.970> it's<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.630> great<00:04:56.870> fit<00:04:56.900> in

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
don't think it's a great fit in

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.600 
don't think it's a great fit in
battlefield<00:04:57.710> 3<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.010> think<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.460> just

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
battlefield 3 I think it's just

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.030 
battlefield 3 I think it's just
incredibly<00:04:59.150> overpowered<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.290> ultimately

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
incredibly overpowered and ultimately

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.120 
incredibly overpowered and ultimately
just<00:05:01.480> aggravates<00:05:02.480> people<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.200> know<00:05:03.320> if<00:05:03.980> you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
just aggravates people you know if you

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.550 
just aggravates people you know if you
want<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.430> make<00:05:04.790> a<00:05:04.820> fun<00:05:05.240> video<00:05:05.540> game<00:05:05.990> then<00:05:06.470> you

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
want to make a fun video game then you

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.380 
want to make a fun video game then you
want<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.770> put<00:05:06.920> elements<00:05:07.220> in<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:07.670> are<00:05:08.030> fun

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
want to put elements in it that are fun

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.810 
want to put elements in it that are fun
for<00:05:08.690> everyone<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.410> play<00:05:09.530> with<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.040> so<00:05:10.190> far<00:05:10.520> the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
for everyone to play with and so far the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.720 
for everyone to play with and so far the
fun<00:05:11.180> side<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.230> c-130<00:05:12.770> seems<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.310> only<00:05:13.580> be

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
fun side of the c-130 seems to only be

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.550 
fun side of the c-130 seems to only be
the<00:05:13.880> gunner<00:05:14.120> seat<00:05:14.450> sure<00:05:14.810> it's<00:05:14.960> fun<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.260> sit<00:05:15.440> in

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
the gunner seat sure it's fun to sit in

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.770 
the gunner seat sure it's fun to sit in
there<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.860> just<00:05:15.950> mow<00:05:16.550> down<00:05:16.760> squads<00:05:17.510> of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
there and just mow down squads of

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.690 
there and just mow down squads of
infantry<00:05:18.290> because<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:18.770> so<00:05:18.920> easy<00:05:19.190> to<00:05:19.460> do<00:05:19.670> and

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
infantry because it's so easy to do and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.210 
infantry because it's so easy to do and
it's<00:05:20.030> kind<00:05:20.240> of<00:05:20.270> fun<00:05:20.600> but<00:05:21.350> at<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.800> same<00:05:21.980> time

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
it's kind of fun but at the same time

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.760 
it's kind of fun but at the same time
it's<00:05:22.490> totally<00:05:22.970> unfun<00:05:23.540> for<00:05:23.840> everybody<00:05:24.440> on<00:05:24.650> the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
it's totally unfun for everybody on the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.280 
it's totally unfun for everybody on the
receiving<00:05:25.190> end<00:05:25.520> of<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:26.150> gunship<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:26.990> do<00:05:27.200> you

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
receiving end of the gunship so do you

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.600 
receiving end of the gunship so do you
really<00:05:27.530> want<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.740> put<00:05:27.890> mechanics<00:05:28.370> in<00:05:28.490> your

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
really want to put mechanics in your

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.400 
really want to put mechanics in your
game<00:05:28.820> that<00:05:28.850> are<00:05:29.150> really<00:05:29.390> fun<00:05:29.600> for<00:05:29.750> one<00:05:29.960> person

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
game that are really fun for one person

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.500 
game that are really fun for one person
but<00:05:30.860> really<00:05:31.130> aggravating<00:05:31.910> for<00:05:32.120> lots<00:05:32.360> of

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
but really aggravating for lots of

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.930 
but really aggravating for lots of
people<00:05:32.570> I<00:05:33.020> think<00:05:33.560> ultimately<00:05:33.740> that's<00:05:34.430> not<00:05:34.730> the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
people I think ultimately that's not the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.720 
people I think ultimately that's not the
best<00:05:35.210> gameplay<00:05:35.870> decision<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:37.010> hopefully<00:05:37.370> the

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
best gameplay decision so hopefully the

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.540 
best gameplay decision so hopefully the
c-130<00:05:38.240> gunship<00:05:38.630> is<00:05:38.890> extremely<00:05:39.890> limited<00:05:40.100> in

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
c-130 gunship is extremely limited in

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.700 
c-130 gunship is extremely limited in
battlefield<00:05:41.120> 4<00:05:41.240> anyway<00:05:42.080> that's<00:05:42.320> my<00:05:42.470> opinion

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
battlefield 4 anyway that's my opinion

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.530 
battlefield 4 anyway that's my opinion
on<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.160> gunship<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.760> would<00:05:43.880> love<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.180> hear<00:05:44.360> what

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
on the gunship I would love to hear what

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.330 
on the gunship I would love to hear what
you<00:05:44.660> guys<00:05:44.810> think<00:05:44.870> about<00:05:45.230> it<00:05:45.410> if<00:05:45.920> you<00:05:46.100> want<00:05:46.280> to

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
you guys think about it if you want to

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.550 
you guys think about it if you want to
see<00:05:46.490> different<00:05:46.820> things<00:05:47.440> implemented<00:05:48.440> to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
see different things implemented to

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.230 
see different things implemented to
balance<00:05:49.010> out<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.310> use<00:05:49.460> of<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.700> gunship<00:05:50.060> -

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
balance out the use of the gunship -

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.090 
balance out the use of the gunship -
maybe<00:05:50.480> nerf<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:50.990> gunship<00:05:51.350> what<00:05:51.770> do<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:51.920> guys
