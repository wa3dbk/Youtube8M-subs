00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:11.690
 when they hit the camera in the room we 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:14.870
 go to the very last tab here 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.430
 she herself last in the chamber and turn on 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:23.630
 checkmark here clipping here clipping 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:27.830
 tick we turn on and we will have here 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.439
 such a red line here this 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.580
 feast phenomenon she Astana tuned here 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.710
 in this parameter right here is the camera 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.640
 will shoot here is the beginning yes here I am now 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.470
 moving let's say we will stand here 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.630
 any wall right here in yes and 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.880
 lest we take a longer angle yes we are here 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.310
 go there this line here it is with us 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.120
 went into our room let's say now 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.900
 has risen 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.190
 and the second line yes yes yes where do we shoot 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:06.440
 yes here but where it is usually imposed for 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:10.070
 beyond the second wall there further the second 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.780
 the second wall will be at the room here on 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.610
 usually from there, that's all 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.010
 if we don't just take it out 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.760
 half of the interior will cut off and we all do not 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:26.060
 will see there but what are the advantages of this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.220
 reception that we go out with us and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.840
 an opportunity to go beyond the walls 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.400
 interior until it becomes possible but 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.420
 there is also the danger of cutting off part 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.210
 and there 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 or part of the furniture, he us from less there 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.789
 there will be black spots with us 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.189
 one part of the geometry is contained and here 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.229
 there will be black just a stain 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.810
 but mostly and very easy to put 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.240
 the camera's just 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.390
 frontal is easier to set up 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.909
 clipping is easier 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.799
 here is the corner here it is there or the furniture is necessary 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.129
 will hide there part well there 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.769
 small room you have to 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:16.750
 try to adjust the angle there 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.549
 little more there seems that there but 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.459
 in a small room there is no faster 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.380
 there are your own nails too 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:28.090
 which here I am now talking in 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.379
 small rooms there makes faster 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.579
 harder to put like a camera again 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.349
 relatively there usually there living room 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.349
 let's say we had it
