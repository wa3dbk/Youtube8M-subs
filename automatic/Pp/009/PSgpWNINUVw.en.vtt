try a YouTube video shooting this on my
Evo<00:00:07.510> so<00:00:07.870> quality<00:00:08.800> might<00:00:08.950> not<00:00:09.130> be<00:00:09.250> all<00:00:09.370> that

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
Evo so quality might not be all that

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.310 
Evo so quality might not be all that
great<00:00:09.790> but<00:00:09.820> I'll<00:00:10.150> get<00:00:10.269> to<00:00:10.390> cut<00:00:10.930> to<00:00:11.019> the<00:00:11.110> chase

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.890 
here
this<00:00:12.670> is<00:00:12.790> my<00:00:12.910> GA<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:15.359> replaced<00:00:16.359> the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
this is my GA and I replaced the

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.300 
this is my GA and I replaced the
blinkers<00:00:18.269> on<00:00:19.269> these<00:00:19.989> little<00:00:20.169> side<00:00:20.470> bends<00:00:20.919> here

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
blinkers on these little side bends here

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.960 
blinkers on these little side bends here
and<00:00:21.579> as<00:00:22.029> you<00:00:22.179> can<00:00:22.300> see<00:00:23.550> unless<00:00:24.550> you're<00:00:24.819> really

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
and as you can see unless you're really

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.550 
and as you can see unless you're really
looking<00:00:25.269> you<00:00:25.569> can't<00:00:25.839> really<00:00:26.019> tell<00:00:26.349> what's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
looking you can't really tell what's

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.969 
looking you can't really tell what's
there<00:00:27.839> if<00:00:28.839> you<00:00:28.929> get<00:00:29.079> up<00:00:29.199> really<00:00:29.349> close<00:00:29.649> you<00:00:29.829> can

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:29.979 
there if you get up really close you can

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.859 
there if you get up really close you can
actually<00:00:30.130> see<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.759> presence<00:00:31.269> you<00:00:31.659> know<00:00:31.749> the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
actually see the presence you know the

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.090 
actually see the presence you know the
actual<00:00:32.140> cluster<00:00:33.039> of<00:00:33.100> LEDs<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.699> there<00:00:33.850> but<00:00:35.100> from

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
actual cluster of LEDs in there but from

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.869 
actual cluster of LEDs in there but from
afar<00:00:36.519> it<00:00:36.699> doesn't<00:00:37.059> really<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:38.230> like<00:00:38.699> much<00:00:39.699> is

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:22.479 
can see there's four orange LEDs right
there<00:02:16.660> looks<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:20.380> in<00:02:21.380> distinguish<00:02:21.920> it's

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
there looks like in distinguish it's

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.949 
there looks like in distinguish it's
hard<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.959> actually<00:02:23.959> see<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:26.390> outline<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.750> this

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
hard to actually see the outline of this

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.380 
hard to actually see the outline of this
unit<00:02:27.410> unless<00:02:28.250> you're<00:02:28.400> really<00:02:28.519> looking<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.209> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
unit unless you're really looking for it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.380 
unit unless you're really looking for it
so<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.019> almost<00:02:30.290> looks<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:30.800> clear<00:02:31.390> but

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
so it almost looks like it's clear but

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.360 
so it almost looks like it's clear but
obviously<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.200> outline<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
obviously you see the outline of the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.040 
obviously you see the outline of the
unit<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.880> know<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.360> looks<00:02:38.540> exactly<00:02:38.720> like

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
unit but you know it looks exactly like

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.690 
unit but you know it looks exactly like
the<00:02:39.350> stock<00:02:39.590> ones<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.160> whatever<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.180> are

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
the stock ones to whatever you are

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
the stock ones to whatever you are
whenever<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.820> whenever<00:02:44.150> you're<00:02:44.360> using<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
whenever you whenever you're using the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.550 
whenever you whenever you're using the
turn<00:02:44.900> signal<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.900> know<00:02:47.989> there<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.440> from

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
turn signal so you know there it is from

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.900 
turn signal so you know there it is from
afar<00:02:48.950> zoom<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:51.040> little<00:02:52.040> bit<00:02:52.220> maybe<00:02:52.550> even<00:02:52.790> get

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
afar zoom in a little bit maybe even get

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.250 
afar zoom in a little bit maybe even get
a<00:02:52.940> better<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:56.950> yeah<00:02:57.950> very<00:02:58.220> easy<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.959> do<00:03:00.079> this

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
a better and yeah very easy to do this
