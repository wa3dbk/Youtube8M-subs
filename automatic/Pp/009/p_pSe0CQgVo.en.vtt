00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.960
 new app ideas on this channel 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.870
 yes it's pixar's turn today, so to speak 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 the photoshop for the mobile is really a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.320
 I have to say that I would recommend 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 say I'm doing now as the first time so 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 explain to the surface 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 So I would just go here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 back and forth I have the whole is up 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.820
 English but it is nothing to the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 Thing 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 here you can just log in yes 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 You know what good you can with 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.280
 facebook and twitter must log in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 Here you come here so to speak is the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.410
 Homescreen you can choose the same as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.870
 where you want to edit what explains yes 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.000
 on and even under interests 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.020
 just so interesting pictures like the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.250
 tab says are good in any case 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.890
 pictures when there a little bit 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.859
 three looking 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.629
 they look really good 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.229
 yes and the wiesn are just so to speak the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 last pictures or next to yes shared 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.170
 Under contests is really cool that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 times so yes graphic contex annoying there 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.030
 as far as I know what to win 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 yes is also really cool during the day can 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.720
 You stop there after the hashtags 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.770
 looking for vintage estate birthday or something 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 So there's no question about the topic 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.190
 subspecies is the manufacturer of the pays 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.410
 photos is definitely cool too 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.670
 stop and good is and a the 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.120
 You can like pictures right here 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:46.330
 I'll just go back 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.190
 to the home yes, first of all would be now 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.980
 start editing a bit 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.950
 Take effect for example 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.070
 here is a picture from the gallery 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.540
 just different for example 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.160
 you see very many 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.030
 selection options for example fx 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.079
 so artistry 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 yes I can show a little something 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.849
 so really many here 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.230
 selection options and if he times 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.910
 one is not so beautiful then one has 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 next session again right 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.800
 Good from here you can, so to speak 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.860
 still the red eyes correction that something 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.780
 is also really cool it is easy too 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.390
 operate and has really many 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 functions that you have to say so 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.530
 black and white is or what has 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.500
 cool man he gets like this one 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.670
 preview on the tablet will be the app 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.480
 probably even hotter 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.650
 but I 'll just go out now 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.470
 and then go straight to the next 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.420
 below collage you can then to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.910
 example underground just like facebook 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.680
 cover pictures make it really cool 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.459
 I just want a few now 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.459
 Pictures from so nobody is and that 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.760
 so have a look what it looks like 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.580
 also relatively boring so do I from 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.050
 it once her the corners bit 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.000
 round it off , it looks better 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.930
 and here you can do it the same way 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.310
 extra yes change the wallpaper times 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.900
 you can of course again one of the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.310
 take gallery but I just had to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.590
 here for example that you that 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.860
 prefabricated and then it already looks 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.170
 not so bad 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.460
 Here you can also adjust how 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 yes how much of the behind completely 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.630
 to see, so to speak 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.210
 and when you're done you can do it 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.959
 synonymous right here to add timeline 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:39.040
 or tweet or so that's the real thing 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:42.670
 really cool yes a camera app is synonymous 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.350
 still there but I have to say is 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.480
 the original ones are better though 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.090
 it functions already many cool the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.250
 content but yes I prefer the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.050
 Original times I say under pressure 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.030
 That explains itself, I think of myself 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.030
 I'll show it anyway 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.620
 to 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.840
 man to cut 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.450
 and then you can here equal to a paint 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.820
 and everything there is of course cool then yes 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.510
 for example, there is need or so where then 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.290
 the same with the pen he is doing yes 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.180
 here under foto you can just stop yes 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.580
 to look at the pictures or 1 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.990
 do 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.240
 yes i would definitely be the app 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.100
 really good, I have that too 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.590
 Photoshop as not the free one 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.780
 but the two versions of photoshop 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.520
 on the phone and I have to say that 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 I prefer this version because they are 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.740
 simply easier to use faster 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.720
 is and really cool effects 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.180
 there had with the app really much 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.850
 Can do cool things as it really is 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.540
 a recommendation for free and yes you 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.280
 is there for android android and ios as 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.430
 also android devices and service iphone 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.560
 and ipad and so should actually synonymous 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.330
 So it just works 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.790
 really cool apps i would say 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.590
 just download the same and that 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.760
 what's so far away from me if that's you 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.950
 video would have caught it of course 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.380
 cool if an abo would leave if 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.710
 he did not want to miss would also 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.169
 Super 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.940
 and what pleases me most is one 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.860
 comment 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.310
 and if you have any question, no matter what 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.510
 whether to rap or something with 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.190
 technology has just got into it 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.010
 Comments may simply answer 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.540
 only or there is a video about what 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.540
 in front of me and onlookers
