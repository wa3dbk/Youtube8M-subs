now it's kind of neat about this pedal
is<00:01:14.780> besides<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.500> normal<00:01:15.860> level<00:01:16.840> speed<00:01:17.840> and

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
is besides the normal level speed and

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.260 
is besides the normal level speed and
depth<00:01:18.350> knobs<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.520> high<00:01:19.820> filter

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
depth knobs we have this high filter

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.390 
depth knobs we have this high filter
here<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.080> have<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.380> low<00:01:21.590> filter<00:01:22.010> up<00:01:22.160> here

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
here and we have this low filter up here

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.710 
here and we have this low filter up here
and<00:01:22.580> what<00:01:22.670> they're<00:01:22.790> supposed<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.210> do<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.570> as

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
and what they're supposed to do is as

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.930 
and what they're supposed to do is as
you<00:01:23.930> increase<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.260> high<00:01:24.500> filter<00:01:24.950> you're

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
you increase the high filter you're

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.030 
you increase the high filter you're
supposed<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.570> get<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.870> wider<00:01:27.290> band<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.860> higher

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
supposed to get a wider band of higher

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:43.420 
supposed to get a wider band of higher
frequencies<00:01:28.640> in<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.850> chorus<00:01:41.950> turn<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.130> down

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
frequencies in the chorus turn this down

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.330 
frequencies in the chorus turn this down
as<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.570> increase<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.170> low<00:01:45.680> filter<00:01:46.160> we're

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
as we increase the low filter we're

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.490 
as we increase the low filter we're
supposed<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.670> get<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.060> wider<00:01:47.540> band<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
supposed to get a wider band in the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:04.090 
supposed to get a wider band in the
lower<00:01:48.830> frequencies<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.500> can<00:02:03.619> tell<00:02:03.830> there

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
lower frequencies and you can tell there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.290 
lower frequencies and you can tell there
that<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> lot<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.700> shimmer<00:02:05.030> on<00:02:05.270> that

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
that a lot of the shimmer on that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.870 
that a lot of the shimmer on that
top-end<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:06.110> down<00:02:06.410> but<00:02:07.340> some<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.729> lower

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
top-end is down but some of the lower

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.120 
top-end is down but some of the lower
notes<00:02:08.179> still<00:02:08.479> have<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.840> wobble<00:02:09.259> we'll<00:02:09.950> take

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
notes still have that wobble we'll take

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
this back down to noon and we'll crank

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.240 
this back down to noon and we'll crank
this<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:12.610> as<00:02:13.610> fast<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.480> deep<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:15.019> go

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
this up as fast and as deep as it can go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.160 
this up as fast and as deep as it can go
it's<00:02:16.250> what<00:02:16.370> she<00:02:16.550> said<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.090> will<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.019> see

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it's what she said and I will just see

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:43.260 
it's what she said and I will just see
how<00:02:18.290> crazy<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:18.950> get

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.090 

all<00:02:44.270> right<00:02:44.540> let's<00:02:45.320> see<00:02:45.410> how<00:02:45.500> subtle<00:02:45.950> this

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
all right let's see how subtle this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.560 
all right let's see how subtle this
thing<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.490> get<00:02:46.610> right<00:02:46.820> now<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.270> level

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
thing can get right now I have the level

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.530 
thing can get right now I have the level
at<00:02:47.690> noon<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.200> seems<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.710> be<00:02:48.910> unity<00:02:49.910> gain<00:02:50.180> for

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
at noon that seems to be unity gain for

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.809 
at noon that seems to be unity gain for
those<00:02:50.720> who<00:02:50.960> care

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.920 

you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.789 

not<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.620> lot<00:03:05.890> different<00:03:05.920> from<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:07.650> from<00:03:08.650> the

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
not a lot different from the from the

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.500 
not a lot different from the from the
clean<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:09.819> it<00:03:09.909> makes<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.239> little<00:03:10.329> bit

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
clean but it makes it a little bit

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.559 
clean but it makes it a little bit
warmer

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.840 

so<00:03:18.569> yeah<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:19.050> eight<00:03:19.770> bucks<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.400> can't<00:03:20.640> beat

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
so yeah for eight bucks you can't beat

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.300 
so yeah for eight bucks you can't beat
it<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.240> fine<00:03:21.480> chorus<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.069> fourth

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
it it's a fine chorus this is the fourth
