they could continue to do so with a

approximately<00:00:27.770> 140<00:00:28.759> million<00:00:29.119> tons<00:00:29.540> of<00:00:29.689> coal

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
approximately 140 million tons of coal

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.679 
approximately 140 million tons of coal
per<00:00:30.020> year<00:00:30.470> when<00:00:31.099> combusted<00:00:31.640> one<00:00:32.090> ton<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:32.360> coal

per year when combusted one ton of coal

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.700 
per year when combusted one ton of coal
creates<00:00:33.260> about<00:00:33.649> 2.4<00:00:34.579> tons<00:00:34.910> of<00:00:35.120> co2<00:00:35.710> so

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
creates about 2.4 tons of co2 so

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.240 
creates about 2.4 tons of co2 so
Australia<00:00:37.190> creates<00:00:37.550> about<00:00:38.380> 336<00:00:39.380> million<00:00:39.770> tons

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
Australia creates about 336 million tons

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.720 
Australia creates about 336 million tons
of<00:00:40.489> co2<00:00:40.760> per<00:00:41.360> year<00:00:42.079> from<00:00:42.440> cold<00:00:42.740> one<00:00:43.400> tonne<00:00:43.700> of

of co2 per year from cold one tonne of

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.020 
of co2 per year from cold one tonne of
co2<00:00:44.000> occupies<00:00:44.900> approximately<00:00:45.430> 550<00:00:46.430> cubic

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
co2 occupies approximately 550 cubic

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.100 
co2 occupies approximately 550 cubic
meters<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.020> Australia<00:00:48.920> emits<00:00:49.420> 184<00:00:50.420> trillion

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110

burning it's cold let's imagine we

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.220 
wanted to capture and sequester say
twenty<00:00:57.829> percent<00:00:58.130> of<00:00:58.340> this<00:00:58.520> that's<00:00:59.390> 40<00:00:59.840> billion

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.079 
cubic metres of co2 but how will we
capture<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.530> co2<00:01:03.710> no<00:01:04.579> one<00:01:04.790> has<00:01:04.939> an

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
economically viable answer to this

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.310 
economically viable answer to this
question<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.820> let's<00:01:08.329> ignore<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.689> as<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.049> minor

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
question so let's ignore that as a minor

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.200 
question so let's ignore that as a minor
detail<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.040> imagine<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.579> can<00:01:10.729> capture<00:01:10.970> it

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
detail and imagine we can capture it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.749 
detail and imagine we can capture it
then<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:12.079> next<00:01:12.320> problem<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:12.740> face<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.130> moving

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
then the next problem we face is moving

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.910 
then the next problem we face is moving
it<00:01:13.960> transporting<00:01:14.960> 40<00:01:15.289> billion<00:01:15.469> litres<00:01:15.889> of

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
anything isn't easy especially gas let's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.469 
anything isn't easy especially gas let's
imagine<00:01:19.159> all<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.579> storage<00:01:19.819> facilities<00:01:20.359> are

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
imagine all the storage facilities are

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.480 
imagine all the storage facilities are
on<00:01:20.569> land<00:01:20.869> but<00:01:21.079> let's<00:01:21.530> also<00:01:21.710> assume<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.280> too

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
on land but let's also assume the too

on land but let's also assume the too
far<00:01:22.759> away<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.969> build<00:01:23.329> a<00:01:23.420> pipeline<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.469> co2

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
far away to build a pipeline so the co2

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.669 
far away to build a pipeline so the co2

its liquefied state obviously this would

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.730 
its liquefied state obviously this would

extra<00:01:36.170> energy<00:01:36.350> will<00:01:36.679> be<00:01:36.829> required<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.299> let's

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
extra energy will be required but let's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.419 
extra energy will be required but let's
assume<00:01:38.569> the<00:01:38.840> co2<00:01:39.259> just<00:01:39.560> politely<00:01:39.889> freezes

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
assume the co2 just politely freezes

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.340

million<00:01:49.279> tons<00:01:49.639> per<00:01:49.939> year<00:01:49.969> so<00:01:50.689> that's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
million tons per year so that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.050

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
prevailing idea is that we pump the co2

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.440 
prevailing idea is that we pump the co2
down<00:01:57.950> into<00:01:58.340> underground<00:01:58.670> reservoirs
