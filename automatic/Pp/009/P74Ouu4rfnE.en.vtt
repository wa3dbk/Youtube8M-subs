00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.150
 a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.890
 This time too, to bring it to standing quickly from the state of being on the floor 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 There is movement of the joint 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.200
 First of all , I will try to roll over 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.200
 I'm left-handed, so I'm going to roll to this left 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.300
 It is a normal strategy 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'll face you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.490
 Yes 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.829
 If this can be 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.520
 That 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.120
 I will try from the floor 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:48.690
 8 will begin at amazing low position of start 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 At first we only try to roll over from here 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.690
 Yes 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.200
 I just say that the start position is squatting I will practice this first 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.100

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.360
 From the crooked place 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.360
 Chofu shop 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.320
 Once you get here 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.680
 Next is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.370
 I do it with one hand 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.370
 From this form 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.540
 th 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.720
 But you can see 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 From this form 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 Four 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 And then in turn put the run-up at the time of going to it backflip I have a Ron Gar Dotte 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.500
 I'm sorry but 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.400
 It's a bouncing guy 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.400
 In the same way 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.180

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.940

 This is the same feeling from the followers 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.159
 I feel a little bit like a book 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.159

 I 'm going to the side right now, but some 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.450
 Please go diagonally back 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.080
 I feel like I'm doing Ron now with one hand behind diagonally 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.880
 I am 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.820

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.290
 2 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 It feels like I'm not trying to use it for joints by connecting this to footwork 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.630
 So let's actually go next with sound
