00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.680
 with the goal of having a greater 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 approach with the coaches of the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 first division teams and take 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.019
 decisions that benefit performance 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.879
 of the national soccer team in 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.650
 the coming matches when god 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.900
 castle met with the technicians of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.270
 the alliance independent youth 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.270
 atletico marte and the auxiliary of fast 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.039
 to the players what tastes good 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.850
 what we have seen technically 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.800
 but politically in things that is 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.440
 technical to technical so but what 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.900
 important that it was a one never talk 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.070
 he had given help and that's the most 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.550
 important about some players that 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 I was worried about proceeding to know how 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.550
 render 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 players feel the loan and that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.040
 teams can play without selected 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 some date 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.550
 it is also something that enters 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.400
 and I think we have to give in some 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.540
 measure and I think there are 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.220
 a lot of availability but as I say 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.780
 this topic has to be covered by a 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.490
 more integral way 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.190
 and obviously the opinion of the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.950
 leaders because it also ends up 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.960
 define the time well although it is already 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.800
 decided that there will be a call for 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.840
 from Monday 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.550
 and that because I think there is no 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.550
 problem I think we can handle 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.180
 very good 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.920
 and without us getting hurt despite 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.750
 that there was a certain secrecy about what 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 that was spoken at the meeting it is known that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.050
 there was a brainstorming that will serve 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.390
 to prepare the work of the next 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.640
 days facing the games against the coast 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.110
 rica and mexico in next october 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 also some points were touched 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 Regarding the aspects to consider 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.230
 to make the call for these 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.090
 encounters we 've seen 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.399
 about one of the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.900
 players that have left us there 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.149
 past 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.420
 and they have some suggestions but 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.520
 we are all the same 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.750
 there is nothing relevant that can be 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.420
 what do you think about the existence of your own 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.150
 kind of technical lives this morning 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.090
 well, that is, I think right now 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.170
 the priority is the savior and these 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.600
 technicians believe in that and you came 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.920
 to bring some ideas 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.870
 and it was known that players like danny 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.120
 Torres Marcelo Messiahs Mordecai 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.800
 Henriquez and Luis Anaya were suggested 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.940
 the Mexican to be taken into account 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.940
 for the new call 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.569
 during the meeting of presidents of 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.239
 first division with the executive committee 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.250
 of the fesfut and juan de dios castillo 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.170
 will ask that the full day 10 of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 opening tournament is carried out this 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.849
 Saturday September 22 in El Salvador
