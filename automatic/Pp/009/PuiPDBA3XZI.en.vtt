this we're ready to insert the other
ends<00:01:33.200> into<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.619> banana<00:01:34.990> now<00:01:35.990> when<00:01:36.470> inserting

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
ends into the banana now when inserting

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.499 
ends into the banana now when inserting
the<00:01:36.950> wires<00:01:37.190> into<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> banana<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.300> want<00:01:38.450> to

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
the wires into the banana you want to

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.060 
the wires into the banana you want to
make<00:01:38.659> sure<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:39.170> both<00:01:39.380> wires<00:01:39.770> are

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
make sure that both wires are

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.670 
make sure that both wires are
approximately<00:01:41.060> one<00:01:41.810> inch<00:01:42.050> apart<00:01:42.229> from<00:01:42.530> each

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
approximately one inch apart from each

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
approximately one inch apart from each
other

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.810 

like<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:54.220> want<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.460> let<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.610> sit

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
like that now you want to let it sit

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.910 
like that now you want to let it sit
like<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.030> for<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.600> least<00:01:55.750> 15<00:01:56.259> minutes<00:01:56.290> to

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
like this for at least 15 minutes to

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100 
like this for at least 15 minutes to
allow<00:01:57.220> enough<00:01:57.640> time<00:01:57.670> for<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.390> acidic<00:01:58.750> energy

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
allow enough time for the acidic energy

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.100 
allow enough time for the acidic energy
to<00:01:59.409> transfer<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.790> found<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> longer

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
to transfer and we found that the longer

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.320 
to transfer and we found that the longer
you<00:02:02.320> let<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.500> sit<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.940> better<00:02:04.119> the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
you let it sit like this the better the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.870 
you let it sit like this the better the
charge<00:02:04.570> will<00:02:04.720> be<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:05.289> charge<00:02:05.530> your<00:02:05.649> iPod<00:02:05.920> now<00:02:06.640> I

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
charge will be to charge your iPod now I

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.460 
charge will be to charge your iPod now I
let<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.210> sit<00:02:07.420> for<00:02:07.570> 30<00:02:07.810> minutes<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.229> show<00:02:08.410> you

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
let this sit for 30 minutes to show you

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.440 
let this sit for 30 minutes to show you
that<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.770> has<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> good<00:02:09.130> charge<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:10.060> next<00:02:10.270> part

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
that it has a good charge the next part

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.300 
that it has a good charge the next part
is<00:02:10.569> simple<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.050> take<00:02:11.350> your<00:02:11.530> USB<00:02:11.800> cable<00:02:12.100> and
