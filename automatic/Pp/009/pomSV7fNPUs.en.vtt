00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.689
 the company and inform project provides 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.159
 satellite services 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.829
 vehicle monitoring from 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.129
 our fuel consumption monitoring systems 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.440
 site on the internet when adding and there is one 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.520
 thousand rubles 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.150
 proposed monitoring system 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.550
 transport is called autograph 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.980
 hardware and software 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.690
 providing for which produce 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 one of the market leaders creating such 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.900
 technocom company systems products 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.050
 which is well known on 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.890
 the territory of Russia and beyond 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.080
 the system works on the principle of collection 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.720
 information from onboard systems 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.380
 vehicle and satellite system 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.940
 glonass same period this data 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.810
 analyzed and in real time 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.950
 are transmitted to the data collection server by 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.690
 the gt3 rs channel is however quite difficult but on 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.500
 practice is very simple 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 it is enough for the user to have 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.080
 computer connected to 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.640
 the internet to see 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.500
 the movement of their cars signs 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 ground run and duration 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.570
 Ariana fuel consumption and getting 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.470
 auto view reports 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.120
 printed spreadsheets and 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 in 1 sd in accounting 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.510
 GDP 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.490
 autograph software 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.720
 is completely free but at the same 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.880
 time off powerful tool 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.360
 control and analysis 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.370
 yes work vehicles 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.720
 in this example in accelerated mode we 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510
 view the movement of cars 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.160
 one of the cities of Russia with the indication 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.530
 Tymoshenko parking places on the map 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.030
 cities 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.030
 bottom left continuously 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
 current wind speed is displayed no 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.280
 the system is left allows you to connect 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.580
 various additional 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.710
 equipment for example 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 high precision fuel gauges 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.360
 Bulk Russia batch gas supply data 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.530
 house automatically 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.269
 transmitted system 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.260
 look at one of the possible options 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.879
 create a daily report created 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.209
 system of autographs with connected books 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.869
 fuel level sensor 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.009
 the top corner contains the total 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.549
 information all this time driving 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.919
 average speed on the graph and black 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.139
 the color shows the speed of the car 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.299
 in red fuel level on any 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.849
 the moment of time during the day is sharp 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.559
 a rise in fuel level marks refueling a 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.629
 its smooth decline during the month 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.629
 shows expenses 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.069
 cube 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.289
 taxi driver can also connect to 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.279
 staffing fuel gauge in 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.479
 in the driverâ€™s cabin in this case 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.959
 will be less accurate and smooth but also refueling 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.779
 liquid fuel prominent enough 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:02.750
 distinctly 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.940
 to determine the place and time of the drain 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.600
 fuel the same schedule you can 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 look at the map 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.869
 on the city map may be indicated 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.179
 control points anywhere in any 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.129
 quantity 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.609
 termination of cars through 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.469
 social objects can be observed in 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.469
 real time either for the same period 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.990
 eye contact 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.670
 it is complemented by various kinds 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.330
 route reports for example 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.000
 This report shows time. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.580
 being at each of the colleagues' sites 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.690
 inside the object the mileage is not only 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.690
 ad objects and articles 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.229
 in system it is possible to connect flow 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.699
 fuel consumption sensors 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.289
 these sensors continuity shields 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.019
 will be the amount flowing through 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.590
 fuel and transfer them to the system 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.659
 autograph gauges mounted 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.050
 trained professionals 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.309
 by installing them directly in 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.889
 fuel line car 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.879
 autograph system without any 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.830
 additional software costs 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.460
 hardware can 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.719
 used to control 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.169
 motor transport throughout 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.949
 Russia on the roads of all cities and regions 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.050
 areas reports on long-distance 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.659
 moving 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:44.479
 it allows you to control 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.169
 fuel consumption paramedics routes 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.889
 automatic control of the facts 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.259
 speeding and alarm setting 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.349
 buttons 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.349
 threatened by 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.780
 in the company informa edge 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.509
 your transport is always supervised
