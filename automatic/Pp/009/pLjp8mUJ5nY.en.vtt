 two 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.520
 the milling machine also known as tupi 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.889
 or router is a power tool 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.140
 which makes profiled grooves and diesel is

 of plastic or acrylic wood 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.070
 It consists of two handles 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.130
 two columns adjustable in their height 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.789
 a clamp holder strawberries 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 a parallel guide 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.990
 a depth gauge 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.910
 a speed regulator 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.180
 a security introducer 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.300
 a dust extractor and the cable 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.300
 electric 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.280
 The drafts and moldings are made with 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.170
 different types of companies that are going 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.610
 changing according to the work you want 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.920
 perform 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.340
 this milling machine came with a set of six 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.260
 dams the first is one to outline 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.000

 wooden structures 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 Strawberries also come to resume 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 which is used to make straight draft 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.860
 also depending on the depth that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.730
 is given and the thickness of the wood or 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 Acrylic also serves to cut 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.620
 the strawberry to please also makes slots 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.930
 but I said the bottom with a termination 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.330
 semicircular very used to make 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.280
 moldings on doors or frames 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.980
 also look at the strawberry that makes fretwork 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.400
 in v are slots with a termination in 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.400
 diagonal 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.040
 another of its accessories is the strawberry of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.700
 half channel that serves to work 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700
 songs 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.490
 and finally he also brings a strawberry to 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.460
 match irregular fields by leaving them 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.229
 perfectly straight 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.750
 to use the milling machine you have to have 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.790
 certain security measures such as glasses 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.560
 to protect your eyes masks 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.130
 for dust and hearing aids to take care 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 the ears 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.510
 to change strawberries you always have to 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.120
 do it with the tool unplugged 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.450
 and using the key that comes included 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.450
 milling machine 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.170
 the depth of the milling in 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.090
 function of the type of cut that can be 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.220
 rotating the screw or for greater 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.030
 Precision with micro adjustment knob 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 where one turn equals one millimeter 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.750
 then the columns are lowered until 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.880
 where the depth gauge indicates and when 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.360
 you have in your definitive position you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.670
 block the piece 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.760
 the parallel cut guide is used with 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.980
 milling cutters for slots and openings 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.290
 fixes the position to be used and so that 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.290
 move the four stops are screwed 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.040
 the place where you work with the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.240
 Milling machine must be a firm inn where 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.520
 you can think the wood 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.470
 before starting the engine it 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.470
 you must hold the machine firmly and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.630
 with both hands the engine is started and 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.240
 It is introduced gradually on 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.360
 the wood to work must never be done 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.160
 walk with the strawberry supported the wood it 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.980
 can enter the wood from a 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.330
 sideways or from above always slowly 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.330
 and holding her firmly 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.950
 the displacement of the machine must be 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.960
 slow and regular if the deep cut does not 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.480
 should be done in one go could 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.400
 several passes are necessary 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.379
 when you reach the end of the material 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.209
 that is getting lost, you have to remove the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.530
 machine and only when the company does not 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.080
 touch the wood 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.030
 turn off the tool and once it 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.549
 does the work it is convenient to take out 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.920
 the strawberry with the machine is plugged in and 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.610
 keep it clean with no signs of splinters 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.610
 or dust
