00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.360
 video here in tgn in spanish my name 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.130
 is neo and today we will make a cut 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.050
 special with the worst companions and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.050
 Support characters in video games 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.410
 or not 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.410
 i 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.650
 over the years we have been able 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.060
 experience great games in which 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.950
 the main characters are seen 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.540
 backed by a series of characters 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.580
 of support many of them fulfill the 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.140
 role of best friends brothers or 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.060
 simply known that end 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 collaborating previously we made a 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.540
 count in which we talked about the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.430
 best teammates but this time we 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 we will focus on the worst characters of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.390
 support of the story that they were nothing 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.390
 efficient and we prefer to forget 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.539
 Roman Belic of the fourth installment of 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.890
 greatness gold is in this list the cousin 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.750
 of our protagonist 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.370
 niko bellic is in charge of ruining 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.409
 part of the depth experience 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.610
 in the game although it adds a lot of attention 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.830
 and interest to the main story 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.450
 whenever we are on a strong mission 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.100
 difficult and that you need a lot 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.259
 concentration there will be roman 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.509
 interrupting again and again so that 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.340
 go to bowling or maybe a bar 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.470
 time a place with some girls he does not 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.979
 has nothing to do and thinks that all 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 they are the same 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.710
 slip it out of starfox 64 is found 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.390
 in the next post this frog with 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.190
 super intelligence is able to create 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.780
 true works of art and that in addition 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.820
 they can be used to execute 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.710
 awesome pirouettes in space 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.720
 unfortunately all this brightness is seen 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.940
 opaque with his terrible voice and the few 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.800
 and also bad advice that the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.570
 moment of the fighting unfortunately 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.550
 he can not keep quiet and at times he 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.960
 full of ego and constantly boasts 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.880
 the enemies that supposedly has 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.479
 eliminated even though fox ends up doing 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 all the work 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.149
 If you go to the sea ​​you have a special place in 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.340
 this count she appears in resident 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.200
 evil 5 as a companion of chris redfield 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.850
 so far I do not remember that someone 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.709
 made me scream at the screen 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.459
 both your artificial intelligence is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.049
 horrible 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.760
 always clogs the line of 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.530
 fire with the enemy and it's nothing 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.599
 discreet if you want to make an attack 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.220
 surprise she will ruin it completely 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.200
 revealing your position with your screams and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.790
 movements the worst of all is that for 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.530
 increase the suffering you have to be at 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.060
 pending your health dies or is 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.920
 captured by enemy zombies 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 we will have lost the game if it goes is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.370
 irrelevant lacks personality 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.410
 fortunately we have not seen her again 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.360
 in the franchise at times I thought that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.310
 would be slider this level 4 the one 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.200
 would enter this count but if you go it 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.200
 takes the bronze medal with honors 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.019
 the game dog that hand has well 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.580
 deserved the second place was difficult to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.470
 choose this position but I think this 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.450
 character is one of the most annoying 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.950
 hypocritical and lazy in the history of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.900
 video games are supposed to be 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.519
 able to easily track the ducks 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.739
 he should help you see more of these 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.900
 from the bushes but it's never like that 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.640
 it seems that it is the opposite and you see 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.590
 reflected in that sarcastic laugh that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.810
 does every time we miss several shots 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.670
 and they do not come up with any objective on which side 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.709
 I think the answer has it 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.709
 super smash bros and preferred the ducks 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.769
 finally we come to the first place and we 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.930
 corresponds to ship of legend of 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.939
 zelda ocarina of time this is one of the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.560
 most hated characters of all the 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.629
 history of video games one of the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.609
 pioneers in this joint narrative in 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.349
 as to his characters and what is I hope 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.420
 to many children who played this title 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.010
 for the first time its main function was 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.349
 serve as a guide through the immense 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.299
 fields of irún and it fulfilled its function well 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.669
 to some extent but after three 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.680
 hours of play his terrible voice sounds and 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.040
 constant interruptions made it 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.170
 a real headache 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.060
 and so we come to the end of this great 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.890
 I count with the supporting characters more 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.689
 hateful of video games how many of 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.519
 these characters also bothered them 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.439
 that others believe we should include in 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.450
