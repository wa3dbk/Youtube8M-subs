 Dear friend! 

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:08.671
 I didn't speak to anyone except my family all summer long. 

00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:15.185
 However, tomorrow will be my first day in school and I want things to change this year. 

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:20.598

 Well, if the English teacher is my only friend I got today, it's pretty depressing.

 Charlie never disappeared from the crowd. 

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.997
 While he didn't make friends who accepted him. 

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:45.341
 So, Charlie! 

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.629
 It looks like a party.

00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:02.052
 -What is he doing? -Do not worry! He's doing this all the time. 

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:08.915
 Think people would talk to you if they knew you were crazy? 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.824
 On it, let's be psychopaths together! 

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.237
 Producers of "Juno". 

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:15.570
 What do you do when you finish the school? 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.388

00:01:34.173 --> 00:01:39.386
 Why is it that we all choose to neglect us? 

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:42.053
 We accept all the love we think we deserve. 

00:01:44.223 --> 00:01:50.510
 -You'll see things. You understand them. You're special. - I wouldn't have guessed anyone. 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.130
 I know there are people who think these things are not happening. 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.065
 And I know that one day it will be just a story. 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.375
 But now we live. 

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:11.126
 And I swear that we are infinitely free at this moment. 

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:13.502
