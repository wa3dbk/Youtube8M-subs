00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.680
It's like a zoo. There are windows all around.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.000
Sometimes people just stop and watch me.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.800
I need some felt for sushi cushions.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.320
It's for a big Manga convention.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.440
They like cute, cuddly things.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.880
I thought those people also like sushi.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.720
I thought I'd make large sushi cushions

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.360
with salmon on top and a cute face at the front.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm sure that'll sell.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.400
What do you have to do now?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.640
Sow. The fair is happening soon.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.480
Yes. Is there a lot to do? And no intern?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.720
No!

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.800
Taking the bottles.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.840
And in there.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.520
No matter how old you are,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.560
your dad will give you empty bottles to return.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.520
He thinks it's educational.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.720
When I was very little,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.760
I wanted to be a Manga artist, a comic artist.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.720
Then I thought that would be difficult.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.040
What else can I do?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.320
I'll be a fashion designer.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.200
So I started making stuff for my Barbie doll

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.200
and for myself, whatever I felt I needed.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.760
I'll do that.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.040
If it doesn't work out I'm still young enough

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.160
to study something "reasonable",

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.320
like business administration

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.320
or environment technology.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.880
But I'm 23 now and it's all worked out so far.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.760
I had a few things as a kid where I thought

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.880
I have to do that before I die.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.640
I had done it all before I turned 22.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.080
I went to Japan, became a designer

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.600
and have my own shop.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.360
If I get run over by a car now it's not so bad.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.240
My dressmaker's angle

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.080
or optional zombie apocalypse weapon.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.160
In case my baseball bat doesn't work.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.680
STEAL AND YOU DIE

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.120
This is our secret shop hatch.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.000
Namely...

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.960
This is my basement hide-out.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.520
Badly behaved interns stay here.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.960
This is my work space.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.680
I make jewellery out of casting resin

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.560
which stinks so horribly you wouldn't believe it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.320
so that I can only do it down here.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.680
So I stand here with my cool mask

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.480
and try not to breathe.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.040
It's a pity Berlin is such a sloppy city

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.680
where everyone can wear whatever.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.800
People walk around in tracksuit bottoms

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.360
which is cool, really.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.640
But people forgot how to dress up, too.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.120
Except for the punks and drag queens.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.160
You need to be bold for that.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
Sometimes I wonder if they play

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.760
or if someone is chasing them with an axe.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.440
This is what they look like.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.720
This much rice and a bit of salmon.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.800
My dad gave me some worldly wisdom

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.200
at the Chinese restaurant: "Not so much rice."

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.040
This is a great cushion, too.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.720
It's my ad cushion. "We stitch for you."
