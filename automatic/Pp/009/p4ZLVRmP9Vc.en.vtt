fluorescent<00:01:33.479> lights<00:01:33.630> inside<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.049> think

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
fluorescent lights inside I think

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.690 
fluorescent lights inside I think
there's<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> whole<00:01:35.159> bunch<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
there's like a whole bunch there's a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
there's like a whole bunch there's a
whole<00:01:35.850> section<00:01:36.060> at<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.600> hardware<00:01:37.020> stores

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
whole section at like hardware stores

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
whole section at like hardware stores
that<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> different<00:01:38.070> types<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.659> lights<00:01:39.659> for

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
that have different types of lights for

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.149 
that have different types of lights for
the<00:01:40.079> fluorescent<00:01:40.500> light<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.829> believe<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the fluorescent light and I believe that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859 
the fluorescent light and I believe that
these<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.579> kitchen<00:01:42.000> day<00:01:42.390> something<00:01:42.780> like

really surprised at how long this light

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.789 
really surprised at how long this light
inside<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.759> mirror<00:01:57.750> has<00:01:57.930> lasted<00:01:58.590> because

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
inside this mirror has lasted because

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.340 
inside this mirror has lasted because
this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.340> seriously<00:02:00.270> since<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.780> started<00:02:01.049> doing

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
this is seriously since I started doing

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.010 
this is seriously since I started doing
videos<00:02:01.649> I've<00:02:01.829> had<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.189> mirror<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.689> light

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
videos I've had this mirror so the light

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.300 
videos I've had this mirror so the light
is<00:02:04.170> definitely<00:02:04.380> not<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.799> bright<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> used

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
is definitely not as bright as it used

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
is definitely not as bright as it used
to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:05.790> once<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> goes<00:02:06.149> out<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.360> will<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.010 
to be but once it goes out I will get a
new<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.860> tried<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> true<00:02:09.020> for

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020

was<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.730> best<00:02:26.910> decision<00:02:27.170> one<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> best

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
was the best decision one of the best

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
was the best decision one of the best
decisions<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.010> made<00:02:29.250> last<00:02:29.790> year<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.330> was

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
decisions I made last year it was

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.100 
decisions I made last year it was
getting<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.340> looked<00:02:32.490> like<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.760> and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
getting this so it looked like this and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.960 
getting this so it looked like this and
this<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.440> has<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.890> speedlight<00:02:35.460> this<00:02:35.670> doesn't

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
this is has a speedlight this doesn't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.320 
this is has a speedlight this doesn't
come<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:37.530> use<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:39.150> my

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
come with it but I use that on my

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.270 
come with it but I use that on my
swatches<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.260> speed<00:02:40.500> light<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.010> number

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
swatches it's a speed light the number

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.650 
swatches it's a speed light the number
is<00:02:41.400> sp<00:02:43.130> 492<00:02:44.130> light<00:02:44.460> so<00:02:45.060> when<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.210> take<00:02:45.330> photos

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
is sp 492 light so when you take photos

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
is sp 492 light so when you take photos
it<00:02:45.870> has<00:02:45.960> big<00:02:46.140> flash<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.700> also<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.680> macro

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
it has big flash I also have a macro

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.650 
it has big flash I also have a macro
lens<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.750> key<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.470> taking<00:02:52.650> good

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
lens this is the key to taking good

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.720 
lens this is the key to taking good
quality<00:02:55.880> product<00:02:56.880> photos<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.810> swatches

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
quality product photos and swatches

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.160 
quality product photos and swatches
obviously<00:02:59.730> everybody<00:03:00.390> can't<00:03:00.660> afford<00:03:00.930> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
obviously everybody can't afford this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.470 
obviously everybody can't afford this
because<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:02.220> camera<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.000> pretty<00:03:03.330> expensive

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
because this camera is pretty expensive

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.140 
because this camera is pretty expensive
it<00:03:03.840> was<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.050> think<00:03:04.110> was<00:03:04.320> around<00:03:04.500> $700<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.670> then

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it was I think was around $700 and then

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.199 
it was I think was around $700 and then
this<00:03:06.390> lens<00:03:06.660> alone<00:03:07.050> was<00:03:07.350> probably<00:03:07.709> $300<00:03:08.700> lenses

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
this lens alone was probably $300 lenses

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.949 
this lens alone was probably $300 lenses
are<00:03:09.330> extremely<00:03:09.990> expensive<00:03:10.350> which<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.750> not<00:03:12.750> so

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
are extremely expensive which is not so

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.110 
are extremely expensive which is not so
fun<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.860> difference<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.580> makes<00:03:14.790> for

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
fun but the difference that it makes for

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.500 
fun but the difference that it makes for
what<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.300> do<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.959> totally<00:03:16.230> worth<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.180> but<00:03:18.180> on

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
what I do it's totally worth it but on

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.690 
what I do it's totally worth it but on
your<00:03:18.810> camera<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:19.920> you're<00:03:20.070> doing<00:03:20.190> swatch

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
your camera you if you're doing swatch

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.229 
your camera you if you're doing swatch
photos<00:03:21.150> take<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.730> flower<00:03:23.730> setting

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
photos take it with the flower setting

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.790 
photos take it with the flower setting
it's<00:03:24.390> usually<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.690> flower<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.410> macro

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
it's usually a flower that's the macro

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.070 
it's usually a flower that's the macro
setting<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.459> then<00:03:26.970> try<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.660> get<00:03:28.019> good

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
setting and then try and get good

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.020 
setting and then try and get good
lighting<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:30.260> just<00:03:31.260> adjust<00:03:31.700> ISO

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
lighting and just adjust ISO

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.220
