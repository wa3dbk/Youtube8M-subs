here<00:02:37.180> see<00:02:38.180> some<00:02:38.360> force<00:02:38.659> acts<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.079> there<00:02:39.260> just

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
here see some force acts in there just

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.979 
here see some force acts in there just
reflecting<00:02:40.519> each<00:02:40.610> other's<00:02:40.879> attacks<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
reflecting each other's attacks the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.420 
reflecting each other's attacks the
lightsaber<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.709> looks<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.069> Jedi<00:02:43.280> is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
lightsaber so it looks like the Jedi is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.240 
lightsaber so it looks like the Jedi is
taking<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.940> Sith<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.360> yet<00:02:45.200> again<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.769> Jedi

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
taking the Sith on yet again and Jedi

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.550 
taking the Sith on yet again and Jedi
takes<00:02:46.549> round<00:02:46.879> two<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.329> still<00:02:47.480> had<00:02:47.659> 70<00:02:48.319> health

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
takes round two and still had 70 health

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
takes round two and still had 70 health
despair<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.209> Jedi<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.569> pretty<00:02:50.810> much

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
despair so the Jedi is pretty much

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.710 
despair so the Jedi is pretty much
