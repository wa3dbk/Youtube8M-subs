00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
bringing it

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.539 
bringing it
by<00:04:19.539> bringing<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:20.019> his<00:04:20.139> floor<00:04:20.620> guess<00:04:21.009> I<00:04:21.219> think

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
by bringing in his floor guess I think

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
by bringing in his floor guess I think
is<00:04:21.729> what<00:04:21.879> it's<00:04:21.999> called<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.479> don't<00:04:23.379> I'm<00:04:23.650> not

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
is what it's called I don't I'm not

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.429 
is what it's called I don't I'm not
really<00:04:24.129> too<00:04:24.460> sure<00:04:24.490> about<00:04:24.699> that<00:04:25.150> but<00:04:25.439> power

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:26.439 
really too sure about that but power

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.709 
really too sure about that but power
punches<00:04:26.889> is<00:04:27.009> practically<00:04:27.520> nothing<00:04:27.729> do<00:04:28.569> the

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
punches is practically nothing do the

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.480 
punches is practically nothing do the
fact<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.199> is<00:04:29.229> resisted<00:04:29.830> by<00:04:29.949> fairy<00:04:30.189> types

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
fact that it is resisted by fairy types

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.550 
fact that it is resisted by fairy types
obviously<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.599> not<00:04:31.870> want<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.169> take<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.319> moon

slamming just yeah I was really dumb on
my<00:05:47.649> part<00:05:47.740> but<00:05:48.069> this<00:05:48.310> extra<00:05:48.729> bit<00:05:48.849> of<00:05:48.879> damage<00:05:49.060> he

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
my part but this extra bit of damage he

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.939 
my part but this extra bit of damage he
gets<00:05:49.449> off<00:05:49.569> with<00:05:49.689> a<00:05:49.750> leaf<00:05:49.990> blade<00:05:50.169> honestly<00:05:50.620> does

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
gets off with a leaf blade honestly does

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.189 
gets off with a leaf blade honestly does
not<00:05:51.219> end<00:05:51.520> up<00:05:51.819> being<00:05:52.149> game-changing<00:05:52.870> in<00:05:53.020> the

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
not end up being game-changing in the

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.649 
not end up being game-changing in the
slightest<00:05:53.680> so<00:05:54.250> he<00:05:54.490> gets<00:05:54.669> off<00:05:54.819> another<00:05:55.029> decent

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
slightest so he gets off another decent

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.059 
slightest so he gets off another decent
amount<00:05:55.930> of<00:05:55.990> damage<00:05:56.229> with<00:05:56.349> Lee<00:05:56.560> played<00:05:56.830> as<00:05:57.009> I

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
amount of damage with Lee played as I

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.249 
amount of damage with Lee played as I
knock<00:05:57.669> him<00:05:57.849> out<00:05:58.000> with<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.360> power<00:05:58.719> of<00:05:58.960> punch

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
knock him out with the power of punch

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.200 
knock him out with the power of punch
which<00:05:59.919> I<00:06:00.129> guess<00:06:00.310> it's<00:06:00.520> fine<00:06:00.759> but<00:06:00.969> he<00:06:01.060> can

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
which I guess it's fine but he can

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.790 
which I guess it's fine but he can
easily<00:06:01.389> just<00:06:01.689> bring<00:06:01.930> in<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.169> floor<00:06:02.409> guess<00:06:02.620> or

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
easily just bring in the floor guess or

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.149 
easily just bring in the floor guess or
the<00:06:02.860> lucario<00:06:03.219> or<00:06:03.759> even<00:06:04.569> though<00:06:04.779> greninja<00:06:05.560> and

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
the lucario or even though greninja and

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.679 
the lucario or even though greninja and
he<00:06:06.250> does<00:06:06.430> in<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.699> bring<00:06:06.879> in<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:07.060> forecast<00:06:07.479> now

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
he does in to bring in the forecast now

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.540 
he does in to bring in the forecast now
I<00:06:07.960> thought<00:06:08.589> that<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:08.949> switch<00:06:09.159> out<00:06:09.310> two<00:06:09.399> snow

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
I thought that the switch out two snow

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.980 
I thought that the switch out two snow
bikes<00:06:09.580> was<00:06:09.939> too<00:06:10.060> obvious<00:06:10.240> so<00:06:10.509> what<00:06:10.689> I<00:06:10.719> did<00:06:10.810> is

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
bikes was too obvious so what I did is

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.260 
bikes was too obvious so what I did is
stated<00:06:11.589> and<00:06:11.830> went<00:06:12.430> for<00:06:12.639> the<00:06:12.759> powerup<00:06:13.240> punch

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
stated and went for the powerup punch

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.969 
stated and went for the powerup punch
predicted<00:06:13.899> him<00:06:14.020> to<00:06:14.199> bring<00:06:14.349> in<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.620> lucario

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
predicted him to bring in the lucario

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.249 
predicted him to bring in the lucario

if you want to bring the lucario because

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
I think I'm faster than him and then I

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:34.550 
I think I'm faster than him and then I
can<00:06:33.629> possibly<00:06:34.020> knock<00:06:34.199> him<00:06:34.319> out<00:06:34.409> with<00:06:34.500> the

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
can possibly knock him out with the

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.320 
can possibly knock him out with the
shadow<00:06:34.770> bar<00:06:34.919> if<00:06:35.069> not<00:06:35.219> then<00:06:35.370> I'm<00:06:35.490> screwed<00:06:35.639> but

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
shadow bar if not then I'm screwed but

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.730 
shadow bar if not then I'm screwed but
he<00:06:36.419> does<00:06:36.599> in<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.870> fluttering<00:06:37.169> office<00:06:37.500> for

he does in the fluttering office for

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.860 
he does in the fluttering office for
Gasol<00:06:38.039> around<00:06:38.370> me<00:06:38.550> to<00:06:38.759> knock<00:06:38.969> him<00:06:39.150> out<00:06:39.270> as<00:06:39.449> he

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
Gasol around me to knock him out as he

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.990 
Gasol around me to knock him out as he
brings<00:06:40.050> back<00:06:40.439> in<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:40.830> appt<00:06:40.979> seoul<00:06:41.280> this<00:06:41.759> turn

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
brings back in the appt seoul this turn

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.580 
brings back in the appt seoul this turn
I<00:06:42.240> really<00:06:42.750> thought<00:06:42.900> he<00:06:43.050> would<00:06:43.199> go<00:06:43.349> for<00:06:43.530> the

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
I really thought he would go for the

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.170 
I really thought he would go for the
pursuit<00:06:43.889> so<00:06:44.069> I<00:06:44.099> make<00:06:44.310> a<00:06:44.340> very<00:06:44.699> risky<00:06:45.000> play<00:06:45.150> I

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
pursuit so I make a very risky play I

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.939 
pursuit so I make a very risky play I
stay<00:06:45.509> in<00:06:45.569> and<00:06:45.750> I<00:06:45.810> go<00:06:45.960> for<00:06:46.139> the<00:06:46.229> destiny<00:06:46.710> bond

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
stay in and I go for the destiny bond

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.409 
stay in and I go for the destiny bond
but<00:06:47.490> it<00:06:47.580> turns<00:06:47.729> out<00:06:47.849> that<00:06:47.909> he<00:06:48.090> just<00:06:48.300> go

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
but it turns out that he just go

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.580 
but it turns out that he just go
straight<00:06:48.689> for<00:06:48.810> the<00:06:48.870> sucker<00:06:49.110> punch<00:06:49.199> again

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
straight for the sucker punch again

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.559 
straight for the sucker punch again
which<00:06:50.129> automatically<00:06:50.789> tells<00:06:51.030> me<00:06:51.210> all<00:06:51.330> right

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
which automatically tells me all right

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.999 
which automatically tells me all right
he<00:06:51.930> most<00:06:52.349> likely<00:06:52.560> does<00:06:53.340> not<00:06:53.639> have<00:06:54.139> the<00:06:55.139> pursuit

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
he most likely does not have the pursuit

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.469 
he most likely does not have the pursuit
so<00:06:56.310> I<00:06:56.340> end<00:06:56.669> up<00:06:56.699> switching<00:06:56.879> out<00:06:57.150> into<00:06:57.360> my

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
so I end up switching out into my

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.939 
so I end up switching out into my
Snorlax<00:06:57.990> his<00:06:58.110> dead<00:06:58.289> father<00:06:58.530> in<00:06:58.680> hindsight

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
Snorlax his dead father in hindsight

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.559 
Snorlax his dead father in hindsight
what<00:06:59.219> I<00:06:59.250> should<00:06:59.490> have<00:06:59.520> done<00:06:59.610> was<00:07:00.270> probably

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
what I should have done was probably

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.269 
what I should have done was probably
stayed<00:07:00.840> in<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:01.139> gone<00:07:01.349> for<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:01.949> sludge<00:07:02.129> bomb

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 
stayed in and gone for the sludge bomb

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.499 
stayed in and gone for the sludge bomb
to<00:07:02.460> knock<00:07:02.610> him<00:07:02.759> out<00:07:02.819> but<00:07:03.000> that<00:07:03.060> would<00:07:03.479> have

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
to knock him out but that would have

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.749 
to knock him out but that would have
been<00:07:03.689> really<00:07:03.750> risky<00:07:04.439> especially<00:07:05.069> if<00:07:05.460> he<00:07:05.550> had

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
been really risky especially if he had

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.820 
been really risky especially if he had
gone<00:07:05.969> for<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.509> sucker<00:07:06.719> punch<00:07:06.840> as<00:07:07.229> he<00:07:07.650> ends<00:07:07.770> up

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
gone for the sucker punch as he ends up

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.290 
gone for the sucker punch as he ends up
going<00:07:08.009> for<00:07:08.219> the<00:07:08.310> night<00:07:08.430> /<00:07:08.669> she<00:07:08.819> gets<00:07:09.000> a<00:07:09.090> crit

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
going for the night / she gets a crit

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.939 
going for the night / she gets a crit
which<00:07:09.479> I<00:07:09.659> highly<00:07:10.080> doubt<00:07:10.379> matters<00:07:10.770> just

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
which I highly doubt matters just

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.080 
which I highly doubt matters just
because<00:07:11.159> Snorlax<00:07:11.520> doesn't<00:07:11.759> really<00:07:11.879> have<00:07:12.060> the

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
because Snorlax doesn't really have the

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.869 
because Snorlax doesn't really have the
best<00:07:12.419> physical<00:07:13.289> defense<00:07:13.620> around<00:07:13.979> and<00:07:14.340> he<00:07:14.639> most

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 
best physical defense around and he most

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:16.249 
best physical defense around and he most
likely<00:07:14.969> would<00:07:15.360> have<00:07:15.419> been<00:07:15.569> able<00:07:15.689> to<00:07:15.840> knock<00:07:16.050> me

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
likely would have been able to knock me

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.080 
likely would have been able to knock me
out<00:07:16.289> with<00:07:16.469> another<00:07:16.710> night<00:07:17.009> /<00:07:17.279> so<00:07:17.490> and<00:07:17.729> the

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
out with another night / so and the

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.820 
out with another night / so and the
indicate<00:07:18.479> really<00:07:18.779> isn't<00:07:19.199> too<00:07:19.349> big<00:07:19.500> of<00:07:19.620> a<00:07:19.710> deal

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
indicate really isn't too big of a deal

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.290 
indicate really isn't too big of a deal
as<00:07:19.889> he<00:07:20.039> knocks<00:07:20.219> me<00:07:20.400> at<00:07:20.580> this<00:07:20.699> point<00:07:20.909> I'm<00:07:21.090> down

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
as he knocks me at this point I'm down

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.600 
as he knocks me at this point I'm down
to<00:07:21.479> my<00:07:21.509> very<00:07:21.810> last<00:07:21.960> pokemon<00:07:22.229> which<00:07:23.009> is<00:07:23.189> gengar

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
to my very last pokemon which is gengar

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.179 
to my very last pokemon which is gengar
and<00:07:23.879> unfortunately<00:07:24.449> absol<00:07:25.319> barely<00:07:25.740> lives<00:07:26.009> as

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.189 
and unfortunately absol barely lives as

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:28.339 
and unfortunately absol barely lives as
toxic<00:07:26.430> so<00:07:26.759> if<00:07:26.879> he<00:07:26.969> goes<00:07:27.150> for<00:07:27.180> sucker<00:07:27.449> punch<00:07:27.719> he

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:28.349 
toxic so if he goes for sucker punch he

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:30.439 
toxic so if he goes for sucker punch he
wins<00:07:28.590> right<00:07:28.860> here<00:07:29.129> if<00:07:29.279> I<00:07:29.729> destiny<00:07:30.090> bond<00:07:30.240> and<00:07:30.389> he

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:30.449 
wins right here if I destiny bond and he

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.119 
wins right here if I destiny bond and he
does<00:07:30.750> sucker<00:07:30.960> punch<00:07:31.229> that<00:07:31.469> I<00:07:31.650> knock<00:07:31.889> him<00:07:32.039> out

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:32.129 
does sucker punch that I knock him out

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.980 
does sucker punch that I knock him out
luckily<00:07:32.699> for<00:07:32.849> me<00:07:33.000> though<00:07:33.180> he<00:07:33.569> didn't<00:07:33.839> go<00:07:33.960> for

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
luckily for me though he didn't go for

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.510 
luckily for me though he didn't go for
sucker<00:07:34.349> punch<00:07:34.589> I<00:07:34.770> guess<00:07:34.919> I'm<00:07:35.039> thinking<00:07:35.430> I

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
sucker punch I guess I'm thinking I

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.579
