00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:02.149 
hey guys I just wanted to create a

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey guys I just wanted to create a
updated<00:00:03.149> video<00:00:03.510> about<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.380> movement<00:00:04.950> system

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
updated video about the movement system

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.120 
updated video about the movement system
I<00:00:05.670> ended<00:00:06.390> up<00:00:06.480> having<00:00:06.799> someone<00:00:07.799> helped<00:00:08.010> me<00:00:08.099> out

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I ended up having someone helped me out

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.759 
I ended up having someone helped me out
with<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.690> got<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.170> working<00:00:10.380> how<00:00:10.740> I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
with it and I got it working how I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.830 
with it and I got it working how I
wanted<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> guess<00:00:12.059> there's<00:00:12.240> gonna<00:00:12.360> be<00:00:12.570> two

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
wanted so I guess there's gonna be two

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.810 
wanted so I guess there's gonna be two
different<00:00:13.170> styles<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.799> movement<00:00:14.160> systems

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
different styles of movement systems

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
different styles of movement systems
that<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.269> could<00:00:15.450> use<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.590> recommend

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that you could use I would recommend

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.560 
that you could use I would recommend
this<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.430> you're<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.940> dota<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:18.420> I

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this one if you're going for dota but I

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.140 
this one if you're going for dota but I
mean<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.140> use<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> other<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.650> for

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
mean you can use the other one for

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.340 
mean you can use the other one for
whatever<00:00:21.150> else<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.750> wanted<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.140> game

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
whatever else have you wanted a game

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.480 
whatever else have you wanted a game
like<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.439> in<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:26.670> movement<00:00:27.029> script

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
like that so in the movement script

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.769 
like that so in the movement script
there<00:00:29.490> were<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.880> things<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> change

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
there were a lot of things that change

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.000 
there were a lot of things that change
for<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:32.730> still<00:00:33.000> had<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.680> all<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
for it it still had like all the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.549 
for it it still had like all the
original<00:00:35.520> stats<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.079> had<00:00:37.260> set<00:00:37.530> up

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
original stats of what we had set up

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
original stats of what we had set up
before<00:00:38.450> but<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.780> only<00:00:39.899> difference<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.590> we

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
before but the only difference is we

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.940 
before but the only difference is we
added<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.370> speed<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.649> that<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.829> can

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
added in speed this time that you can

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
added in speed this time that you can
adjust<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:44.879> fast<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.360> player<00:00:45.570> moves

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
adjust for how fast your player moves

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.319 
adjust for how fast your player moves
and<00:00:47.090> I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.170> target<00:00:49.710> position<00:00:50.210> might<00:00:51.210> have

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and I think a target position might have

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
and I think a target position might have
been<00:00:51.480> updated<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.230> well<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:53.160> still<00:00:53.520> does<00:00:53.699> all

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
been updated as well it still does all

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
been updated as well it still does all
the<00:00:53.940> raycast<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.480> stuff<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:54.930> how<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> handles

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the raycast and stuff but how it handles

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.279 
the raycast and stuff but how it handles
everything<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> lot<00:00:56.670> different<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> here

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
everything is a lot different in here

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.160 
everything is a lot different in here
there's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> there's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.600> different<00:01:00.600> math<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
there's a there's a different math that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
there's a there's a different math that
gets<00:01:01.680> calculated<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> point<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.840> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
gets calculated from the point that you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.240 
gets calculated from the point that you
click<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> oh<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.200> there's<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:08.040> an

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
click so oh and then there's the if an

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.510 
click so oh and then there's the if an
else<00:01:08.400> statement<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.710> equals<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
else statement for if it equals to that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750 
else statement for if it equals to that
distance<00:01:12.000> it'll<00:01:12.390> stop<00:01:12.720> moving<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
distance it'll stop moving so if that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999 
distance it'll stop moving so if that
wasn't<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.540> our<00:01:15.840> player<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.830> be

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
wasn't there our player would just be

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.840 
wasn't there our player would just be
running<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.180> place<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> forth<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
running in place back and forth and it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 
running in place back and forth and it
would<00:01:20.939> look<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.150> weird<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
would look really weird but this it just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
would look really weird but this it just
stops<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.549> place<00:01:23.580> once<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> gets<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.750> if

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
stops in place once it gets there or if

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
stops in place once it gets there or if
you<00:01:25.020> interrupt<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.619> beforehand<00:01:26.189> it'll<00:01:26.490> update

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you interrupt it beforehand it'll update

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.859 
you interrupt it beforehand it'll update
and<00:01:27.380> change<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.860> position<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.479> which

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and change the position what there which

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.069 
and change the position what there which
the<00:01:31.380> player<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.829> moving<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.420> yeah<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the player is moving and then yeah I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.719 
the player is moving and then yeah I
guess<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.439> don't<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:35.030> need<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.090> anymore

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
guess we don't even need that anymore

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.840 
guess we don't even need that anymore
and<00:01:38.719> yeah<00:01:39.110> just<00:01:39.320> uh<00:01:39.619> there's<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.399> new<00:01:40.640> way<00:01:40.789> to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
and yeah just uh there's a new way to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.149 
and yeah just uh there's a new way to
calculate<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.600> out<00:01:41.780> too<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.439> mean<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.009> can

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
calculate that out too so I mean you can

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.920 
calculate that out too so I mean you can
just<00:01:43.310> replace<00:01:43.610> your<00:01:43.909> previous<00:01:44.390> script<00:01:44.719> or

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
just replace your previous script or

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.770 
just replace your previous script or
update<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.619> with<00:01:45.979> these<00:01:46.640> pieces<00:01:46.909> of<00:01:47.119> code<00:01:47.420> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
update it with these pieces of code and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.870 
update it with these pieces of code and
that<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.610> whatnot

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
that and whatnot

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.010 
that and whatnot
so<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.350> go<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.740> check<00:01:52.039> out<00:01:53.020> what's

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
so we can go and check out what's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.419 
so we can go and check out what's
different<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:56.259> see<00:01:57.259> here<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.979> yeah<00:01:58.100> on<00:01:58.250> your

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
different so see here so yeah on your

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.550 
different so see here so yeah on your
player<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:58.970> adjust<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.420> speed<00:01:59.780> at<00:02:00.500> which

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
player you can adjust the speed at which

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.980 
player you can adjust the speed at which
your<00:02:01.039> player<00:02:01.310> moves<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.390> stuff<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.840> it'll

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
your player moves and stuff and it'll

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.200 
your player moves and stuff and it'll
stay<00:02:03.170> constant<00:02:03.710> unlike<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.000> previous

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
stay constant unlike the previous

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.719 
stay constant unlike the previous
tutorial<00:02:05.960> oh<00:02:06.110> yeah<00:02:06.710> there's<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:06.979> bug<00:02:07.399> where

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
tutorial oh yeah there's one bug where

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.820 
tutorial oh yeah there's one bug where
the<00:02:08.239> player<00:02:08.479> starts<00:02:08.869> running<00:02:09.319> towards<00:02:09.739> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
the player starts running towards the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.440 
the player starts running towards the
direction<00:02:10.009> once<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.849> starts

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
direction once it starts

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.330 
direction once it starts
I'll<00:02:11.989> try<00:02:12.290> fixing<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.950> won't<00:02:13.190> make

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
I'll try fixing that I won't make

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.089 
I'll try fixing that I won't make
another<00:02:13.580> video<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.239> I'll<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.950> I'll<00:02:15.950> just

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
another video on it I'll just I'll just

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.460 
another video on it I'll just I'll just
update<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.579> if<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.209> guys<00:02:17.390> can't<00:02:18.049> figure<00:02:18.260> it

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
update it if you guys can't figure it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.440 
update it if you guys can't figure it
out<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.130> I'll<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.579> tell<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.910> guys<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
out so I'll just tell you guys and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.319 
out so I'll just tell you guys and
probably<00:02:20.569> updated<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.890> random<00:02:22.250> video<00:02:22.459> but

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
probably updated in a random video but

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.710 
probably updated in a random video but
you'll<00:02:23.450> probably<00:02:23.630> see<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.049> as<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.500> progresses

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
you'll probably see it as it progresses

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.020 
you'll probably see it as it progresses
but<00:02:26.720> yeah<00:02:26.870> if<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.440> see<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.190> go<00:02:28.760> faraway

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
but yeah if you see if we go faraway

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.300 
but yeah if you see if we go faraway
moves<00:02:29.810> at<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.019> constant<00:02:30.380> speed<00:02:30.530> if<00:02:30.860> we're<00:02:31.010> close

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
moves at a constant speed if we're close

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.660 
moves at a constant speed if we're close
it<00:02:31.700> moves<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.239> same<00:02:33.170> speed<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.549> not

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
it moves that same speed so it's not

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.089 
it moves that same speed so it's not
slow<00:02:35.180> when<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:35.540> closed<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.140> fast<00:02:36.829> when<00:02:37.010> it's

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
slow when it's closed and fast when it's

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.170 
slow when it's closed and fast when it's
far<00:02:37.250> away<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:38.599> yeah<00:02:39.380> that's<00:02:40.310> pretty<00:02:40.430> much<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
far away so yeah that's pretty much the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.809 
far away so yeah that's pretty much the
new<00:02:41.510> updated<00:02:41.870> movement<00:02:42.530> speed<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.430> click

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
new updated movement speed you can click

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.150 
new updated movement speed you can click
all<00:02:43.970> around<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.630> almost<00:02:45.290> exactly<00:02:45.709> like

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
all around so it's almost exactly like

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.860 
all around so it's almost exactly like
dota<00:02:46.459> or<00:02:46.730> League<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.090> Legends<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.600> stuff

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
dota or League of Legends and stuff

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.789 
dota or League of Legends and stuff
where<00:02:48.230> click<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.340> move<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:51.620> want

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
where click can you move I really want

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.289 
where click can you move I really want
to<00:02:51.889> get<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> character<00:02:52.370> animated<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.060> stuff

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
to get a character animated and stuff

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.670 
to get a character animated and stuff
that'd<00:02:53.569> be<00:02:53.660> pretty<00:02:53.840> awesome<00:02:54.609> but<00:02:55.609> yeah<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.590> in

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
that'd be pretty awesome but yeah so in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.110 
that'd be pretty awesome but yeah so in
our<00:02:57.769> next<00:02:58.040> tutorial<00:02:58.100> we'll<00:02:58.549> probably<00:02:58.790> be

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
our next tutorial we'll probably be

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.680 
our next tutorial we'll probably be
either<00:02:59.900> going<00:03:00.290> over<00:03:01.150> enemy<00:03:02.150> spotting<00:03:02.569> our

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
either going over enemy spotting our

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.539 
either going over enemy spotting our
towers<00:03:03.139> or<00:03:03.380> something<00:03:03.799> along<00:03:04.190> those<00:03:04.250> lines

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
towers or something along those lines

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.640 
towers or something along those lines
I'll<00:03:04.910> try<00:03:05.090> getting<00:03:05.389> some<00:03:05.930> more<00:03:06.049> videos<00:03:06.380> done

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I'll try getting some more videos done

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.289 
I'll try getting some more videos done
today<00:03:06.950> I'm<00:03:07.130> still<00:03:07.370> researching<00:03:07.760> some<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.150> this

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
today I'm still researching some of this

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.400 
today I'm still researching some of this
stuff<00:03:08.569> but<00:03:08.780> uh<00:03:08.889> yeah<00:03:09.889> stay<00:03:10.190> tuned
