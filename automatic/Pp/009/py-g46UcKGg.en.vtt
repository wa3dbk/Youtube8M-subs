you

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.209 
you
we're<00:00:13.809> gonna<00:00:13.960> look<00:00:14.080> at<00:00:14.260> their<00:00:14.469> hallway<00:00:14.950> you

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
we're gonna look at their hallway you

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.420 
we're gonna look at their hallway you
see<00:00:15.490> all<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:16.170> parallel<00:00:17.170> lines<00:00:17.410> over<00:00:18.010> here<00:00:18.040> in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
see all the parallel lines over here in

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.170 
see all the parallel lines over here in
the<00:00:18.580> hallway<00:00:18.939> you<00:00:19.300> see<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.020> line<00:00:20.230> on<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.710> top

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the hallway you see the line on the top

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.880 
the hallway you see the line on the top
between<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.300> ceiling<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:23.050> wall<00:00:23.380> that's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
between the ceiling and the wall that's

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.780 
between the ceiling and the wall that's
the<00:00:24.130> line<00:00:24.340> right

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
the line right

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.530 
the line right
and<00:00:24.970> that<00:00:25.509> line<00:00:25.779> supposed<00:00:26.770> to<00:00:26.950> be<00:00:27.540> parallel

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
and that line supposed to be parallel

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.009 
and that line supposed to be parallel
with<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.109> footer<00:00:29.439> line<00:00:29.800> right<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:31.689> if

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
with the footer line right because if

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.170 
with the footer line right because if
you<00:00:32.230> use<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.470> ruler<00:00:32.769> mention<00:00:33.489> them<00:00:33.670> that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
you use a ruler mention them that

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.869 
you use a ruler mention them that
exactly<00:00:34.629> supposed<00:00:35.080> to<00:00:35.199> be<00:00:35.320> same<00:00:35.530> high<00:00:35.879> and

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
exactly supposed to be same high and

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.390 
exactly supposed to be same high and
also<00:00:37.090> you're<00:00:37.480> looking<00:00:37.780> at<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.500> line<00:00:38.739> on<00:00:39.100> what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
also you're looking at the line on what

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.350 
also you're looking at the line on what
the<00:00:39.550> f<00:00:39.640> is<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.150> dark<00:00:40.449> line<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.820> way<00:00:42.850> it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
the f is the dark line all the way it

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.139 
the f is the dark line all the way it
should<00:00:43.420> be<00:00:43.690> also<00:00:44.170> parallel<00:00:44.710> what<00:00:45.460> is<00:00:45.760> two

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
should be also parallel what is two

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.869 
should be also parallel what is two
lines<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.840> think<00:00:47.500> about<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.950> line<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.460> here

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
lines and think about the line of here

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.360 
lines and think about the line of here
this<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.899> whole<00:00:50.079> line<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.620> also<00:00:51.129> parallel

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
this the whole line is also parallel

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.650 
this the whole line is also parallel
right<00:00:51.820> they<00:00:52.719> are<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.980> are<00:00:54.239> lots<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.390> other

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
right they are they are lots of other

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.200 
right they are they are lots of other
lines<00:00:55.960> are<00:00:56.200> parallel<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.829> but<00:00:57.520> you<00:00:57.910> can

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
lines are parallel to but you can

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.920 
lines are parallel to but you can
network<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.860> light<00:01:00.270> fixture<00:01:01.270> and<00:01:01.480> the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
network the the light fixture and the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
network the the light fixture and the
ceiling<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.910> sideline<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:05.259> connect<00:01:05.770> them

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
ceiling the sideline you connect them

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.540 
ceiling the sideline you connect them
all<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.550> way<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:07.720> answer<00:01:08.080> they<00:01:08.229> also<00:01:08.470> form<00:01:09.340> a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
all the way the answer they also form a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.249 
all the way the answer they also form a
line<00:01:09.789> parallel<00:01:10.570> what<00:01:11.110> those<00:01:11.560> existing<00:01:12.399> lines

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.370 

with<00:01:17.259> those<00:01:17.440> lines<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:19.000> those<00:01:19.240> are<00:01:19.569> in<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
with those lines so those are in the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.210 
with those lines so those are in the
same<00:01:20.789> parallel<00:01:21.789> line<00:01:22.240> group<00:01:22.890> they're<00:01:23.890> going

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
same parallel line group they're going

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.779 
same parallel line group they're going
to<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.179> same<00:01:25.360> directions<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:27.369> standing

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
to the same directions you're standing

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.600 
to the same directions you're standing
in<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.970> center<00:01:28.360> right<00:01:28.770> you're<00:01:29.770> looking<00:01:30.160> at<00:01:30.399> it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
in the center right you're looking at it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.589 
in the center right you're looking at it
all<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:30.880> way<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.220> middle<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:34.030> poster

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
all the way to the middle of the poster

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.930 
all the way to the middle of the poster
in<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.020> far<00:01:35.319> end<00:01:35.770> war<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.670> actually

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
in the far end war can you actually

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.749 
in the far end war can you actually
connect<00:01:40.690> their<00:01:40.929> depth<00:01:41.500> up<00:01:41.770> over<00:01:42.340> there<00:01:42.550> and

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
connect their depth up over there and

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.910 
connect their depth up over there and
then<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.450> fine<00:01:43.690> wall<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.380> middle<00:01:44.410> of<00:01:44.739> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
then in a fine wall in the middle of the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.650 
then in a fine wall in the middle of the
poster<00:01:45.369> if<00:01:45.580> you're<00:01:45.759> standing<00:01:46.179> there<00:01:46.209> in<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
poster if you're standing there in the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.249 
poster if you're standing there in the
out<00:01:47.080> right<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.890> center<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.429> hallway<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
out right the center of the hallway you

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.520 
out right the center of the hallway you
can<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:51.399> can<00:01:51.610> see<00:01:51.849> that<00:01:52.060> line<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.840> connect

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
can you can see that line and connect

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.419 
can you can see that line and connect
what<00:01:53.920> all<00:01:54.610> those<00:01:55.800> parallel<00:01:56.800> line<00:01:57.099> together

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
what all those parallel line together

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.350 
what all those parallel line together
can<00:01:58.179> you<00:01:58.270> see<00:01:58.450> that<00:02:00.060> right

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
can you see that right

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.359 
can you see that right
that<00:02:02.289> is<00:02:02.530> our<00:02:02.979> vanishing<00:02:03.789> point<00:02:04.830> one<00:02:05.830> managing

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
that is our vanishing point one managing

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.529 
that is our vanishing point one managing
point<00:02:06.700> for<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.149> whole<00:02:07.800> same<00:02:08.800> group<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.640> parallel

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
point for a whole same group of parallel

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.160 
point for a whole same group of parallel
lines<00:02:10.810> together<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.840> point

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
lines together this is one point

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.520 
lines together this is one point
perspective<00:02:15.090> okay<00:02:16.090> let's<00:02:16.750> go<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.020> draw<00:02:17.319> that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
perspective okay let's go to draw that

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.890 
perspective okay let's go to draw that
really<00:02:17.830> quickly<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.270> course<00:02:19.510> I'm<00:02:19.720> gonna

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
really quickly and of course I'm gonna

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.230 
really quickly and of course I'm gonna
throw<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.470> end<00:02:20.830> off<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.340> line<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.970> know<00:02:22.120> how

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
throw this end off the line you know how

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.839 
throw this end off the line you know how
to<00:02:22.300> measure<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.870> angle<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> line<00:02:23.620> right

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
to measure the angle of the line right

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.319 
to measure the angle of the line right
so<00:02:25.120> over<00:02:25.420> there<00:02:25.629> okay<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.469> got<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.549> if<00:02:27.999> I<00:02:28.090> have

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
so over there okay I got it if I have

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.670 
so over there okay I got it if I have
over<00:02:29.260> here

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
over here

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.379 
over here
the<00:02:30.280> pelo<00:02:30.730> mine<00:02:30.939> over<00:02:31.209> here<00:02:31.739> okay<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:34.150> that

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
the pelo mine over here okay and that

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.759 
the pelo mine over here okay and that
what<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:35.620> about<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.609> angle<00:02:37.769> got

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
what that is about this at the angle got

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.599 
what that is about this at the angle got
that<00:02:39.599> right<00:02:40.659> oh<00:02:40.870> we're<00:02:41.290> never<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.709> same<00:02:41.739> the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
that right oh we're never the same the

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:52.110 
that right oh we're never the same the
same<00:02:42.790> thing<00:02:48.780> yeah<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:50.469> find<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.919> angle<00:02:51.219> right

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
same thing yeah we find this angle right

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.500 
same thing yeah we find this angle right
and<00:02:52.480> now<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.709> double<00:02:54.370> check<00:02:54.760> angle<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.359> this

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
and now the double check angle of this

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.619 
and now the double check angle of this
two<00:02:55.780> line<00:02:55.989> if<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.469> find<00:02:56.799> this<00:02:57.099> this<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.269> angle

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
two line if you find this this the angle

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.420 
two line if you find this this the angle
of<00:02:58.689> this<00:02:58.810> two<00:02:59.019> line<00:02:59.230> you're<00:02:59.829> supposed<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.310> be

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
of this two line you're supposed to be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.670 
of this two line you're supposed to be
able<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.730> locate<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.719> vanishing<00:03:02.169> point<00:03:02.409> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
able to locate the vanishing point and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.189 
able to locate the vanishing point and
this<00:03:03.189> is<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.459> same<00:03:03.819> managing<00:03:04.180> point<00:03:04.569> also<00:03:04.989> of

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
this is the same managing point also of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:13.020 
this is the same managing point also of
a<00:03:05.500> pride<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:07.709> apply<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:10.139> find<00:03:11.139> and<00:03:11.739> go<00:03:12.129> up<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
a pride to apply to find and go up the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.949 
a pride to apply to find and go up the
other<00:03:13.150> line<00:03:13.650> approaches<00:03:14.879> this<00:03:15.879> point<00:03:16.599> this

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
other line approaches this point this

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.789 
other line approaches this point this
line<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.129> top<00:03:18.340> over<00:03:18.519> here<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:19.449> and<00:03:20.319> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
line on the top over here and and the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.479 
line on the top over here and and the
line<00:03:21.040> down<00:03:21.760> here<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.560> however<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:24.129> need<00:03:24.370> to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
line down here but however you need to

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.449 
line down here but however you need to
find<00:03:24.939> the<00:03:25.120> angle<00:03:25.329> okay<00:03:26.319> use<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.829> horizontal

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
find the angle okay use the horizontal

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:35.550 
find the angle okay use the horizontal
line<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:28.359> locate<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.989> angle<00:03:33.509> okay<00:03:34.509> so<00:03:35.169> we<00:03:35.530> use

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
line to locate the angle okay so we use

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.949 
line to locate the angle okay so we use
the<00:03:36.069> perspective<00:03:36.849> in<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.239> lower<00:03:37.449> and<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
the perspective in the lower and the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.640 
the perspective in the lower and the
footer<00:03:38.259> over<00:03:38.590> here<00:03:38.829> that's<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.759> line<00:03:40.650> about

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
footer over here that's the line about

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.580 
footer over here that's the line about
this<00:03:41.829> angle<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:43.209> draw<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.900> then<00:03:43.959> your<00:03:44.439> top

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
this angle you draw it and then your top

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.319 
this angle you draw it and then your top
will<00:03:44.769> check<00:03:45.009> it<00:03:45.189> okay<00:03:46.709> yeah<00:03:47.709> that's<00:03:48.069> about

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
will check it okay yeah that's about

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.190 
will check it okay yeah that's about
that<00:03:49.329> angle

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.920 

yeah<00:03:54.200> that's<00:03:54.590> about<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.070> angle<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:56.000> after

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
yeah that's about this angle and after

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.580 
yeah that's about this angle and after
you<00:03:57.520> find<00:03:58.520> out<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.940> angle<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.600> those<00:03:59.840> line<00:04:00.200> but

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
you find out the angle of those line but

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.370 
you find out the angle of those line but
it's<00:04:00.980> common<00:04:01.520> thing<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:02.060> they<00:04:02.270> connect<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.350> the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
it's common thing is they connect to the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.540 
it's common thing is they connect to the
same<00:04:04.300> vanishing<00:04:05.300> point<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.410> then<00:04:06.830> after<00:04:07.370> you

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
same vanishing point and then after you

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.670 
same vanishing point and then after you
get<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.880> correct<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:08.540> then<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.200> would<00:04:09.530> be

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
get it correct and then you would be

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.560 
get it correct and then you would be
able<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:10.040> finish<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.640> drawing<00:04:10.880> with<00:04:11.360> a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
able to finish the drawing with a

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.060 
able to finish the drawing with a
perfect<00:04:12.170> beautiful<00:04:13.810> perspective<00:04:14.810> just<00:04:15.800> at

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
perfect beautiful perspective just at

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.210 
perfect beautiful perspective just at
all<00:04:16.280> over<00:04:16.609> there<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.200> far<00:04:18.410> hallway<00:04:18.920> and

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
all over there and the far hallway and

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.940 
all over there and the far hallway and
this<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.640> ceiling<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.530> can<00:04:27.710> see

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
this the ceiling and then you can see

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.690 
this the ceiling and then you can see
also<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.670> top<00:04:28.970> of<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.450> door<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:30.470> can<00:04:30.680> form

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.310 

connect<00:04:34.700> with<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.970> same<00:04:35.240> vanishing<00:04:35.810> point

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
connect with the same vanishing point

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.650 
connect with the same vanishing point
because<00:04:36.770> this<00:04:37.040> going<00:04:37.490> also<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> same

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
because this going also the same

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.870 
because this going also the same
parallel<00:04:39.140> line<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:40.280> know<00:04:40.400> what<00:04:40.640> the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
parallel line and you know what the

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.510 
parallel line and you know what the
poster<00:04:41.270> board<00:04:41.510> over<00:04:41.750> here<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.280> if<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.460> know

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
poster board over here and if I know

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.080 
poster board over here and if I know
that<00:04:44.360> voice<00:04:45.169> is<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:46.010> top<00:04:46.250> was<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.520> bottom

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
that voice is the the top was the bottom

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.990 
that voice is the the top was the bottom
and<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:48.290> can<00:04:48.320> also<00:04:48.980> connect<00:04:49.610> with<00:04:49.700> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
and I can also connect with the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.970 
and I can also connect with the
vanishing<00:04:50.300> point<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:54.169> can<00:04:54.290> find<00:04:54.590> out<00:04:54.770> ways

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
vanishing point you can find out ways

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.520 
vanishing point you can find out ways
with<00:04:55.480> exactly<00:04:56.860> this<00:04:57.860> board<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.640> amazing

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
with exactly this board is that amazing

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.159 
with exactly this board is that amazing
it's<00:05:03.530> become<00:05:03.980> it's<00:05:04.280> very<00:05:04.580> useful<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.120> with<00:05:05.930> the

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
it's become it's very useful to with the

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.580 
it's become it's very useful to with the
perspective<00:05:07.810> basically<00:05:08.810> serve<00:05:09.260> as<00:05:09.290> the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
perspective basically serve as the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.710 
perspective basically serve as the
guideline<00:05:10.070> so<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.880> will<00:05:11.030> be<00:05:11.210> able<00:05:11.330> to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
guideline so that you will be able to

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.330 
guideline so that you will be able to
draw<00:05:12.410> something<00:05:12.800> make<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.430> look<00:05:13.729> like<00:05:14.000> real

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
draw something make it look like real

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.640 
draw something make it look like real
I'm<00:05:16.340> gonna<00:05:16.430> try<00:05:16.729> really<00:05:17.030> quickly<00:05:17.510> as<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.440> know

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
I'm gonna try really quickly as you know

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.700 
I'm gonna try really quickly as you know
the<00:05:18.890> theory<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:19.700> all<00:05:20.330> over<00:05:20.660> here<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.200> then

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
the theory that all over here and then

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.110 
the theory that all over here and then
is<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.520> door

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
is the door

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.320 
is the door
the<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.930> door<00:05:24.140> over<00:05:24.410> there<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:26.120> door

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
the to door over there and the door

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.300

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
and this ceiling also Caroline connect

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.120 
and this ceiling also Caroline connect
to<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:38.840> same<00:05:39.050> running<00:05:39.320> point<00:05:41.530> no<00:05:42.530> not<00:05:42.889> that

survived<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:48.530> can<00:05:48.830> be<00:05:49.430> able<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.790> draw<00:05:50.000> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
survived so you can be able to draw the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.820 
survived so you can be able to draw the
light<00:05:50.389> right<00:05:50.870> in<00:05:51.050> front<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.410> no<00:05:51.680> not<00:05:52.070> that<00:05:52.250> much

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
light right in front of no not that much

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.680 
light right in front of no not that much
okay<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.250> distance<00:05:56.020> and<00:05:57.020> that's<00:05:58.600> sitting<00:05:59.600> on

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
okay the distance and that's sitting on

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.930 
okay the distance and that's sitting on
the<00:05:59.750> top<00:06:00.080> behind<00:06:00.830> this<00:06:00.980> tough<00:06:01.580> ceiling<00:06:02.440> also

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
the top behind this tough ceiling also

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.920 
the top behind this tough ceiling also
going<00:06:04.940> like<00:06:06.160> same<00:06:07.160> vanishing<00:06:07.370> point<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:08.570> top

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
going like same vanishing point the top

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.780 
going like same vanishing point the top
and<00:06:10.060> then<00:06:11.060> this<00:06:11.510> line<00:06:11.900> in<00:06:12.560> connected<00:06:13.340> a<00:06:13.520> little

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
and then this line in connected a little

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.690 
and then this line in connected a little
bit<00:06:13.880> shorter<00:06:14.300> than<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:15.440> distance<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:18.700> this

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
bit shorter than the distance and this

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:31.390 
bit shorter than the distance and this
line<00:06:28.300> after<00:06:29.300> you<00:06:29.419> have<00:06:29.600> those<00:06:29.840> done<00:06:30.400> there

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
line after you have those done there

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.210 
line after you have those done there
will<00:06:31.490> be<00:06:31.550> very<00:06:32.090> quick<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:33.260> easy<00:06:33.970> to<00:06:34.970> create<00:06:35.150> a

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
will be very quick and easy to create a

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.990 
will be very quick and easy to create a
nice<00:06:37.220> picture<00:06:38.620> shading<00:06:39.620> is<00:06:39.770> easy<00:06:40.160> but<00:06:40.790> however

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
nice picture shading is easy but however

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.120 
nice picture shading is easy but however
you<00:06:41.450> find<00:06:41.630> other<00:06:41.900> to<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.979> true<00:06:43.310> it<00:06:43.940> takes<00:06:44.270> time

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.370 

that's<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.310> beginning<00:06:49.510> but<00:06:50.510> you<00:06:50.690> first<00:06:51.110> have

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
that's the beginning but you first have

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.169 
that's the beginning but you first have
to<00:06:51.440> get<00:06:51.770> the<00:06:51.979> perspective<00:06:52.450> line<00:06:53.450> correctly
