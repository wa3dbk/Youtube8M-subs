00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
won't turn on or anything what it is is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
won't turn on or anything what it is is
that<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.640> heater<00:01:26.640> controls<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.570> not

that the heater controls are not

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.510 
that the heater controls are not
responding<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.460> essentially<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
responding to what it is essentially the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.749 
responding to what it is essentially the
problem<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:34.170> heat<00:01:34.439> only<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.130> heat<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
problem is the heat only the heat or the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.870 
problem is the heat only the heat or the
air<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.509> blower<00:01:36.840> only<00:01:37.439> blows<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.400> either<00:01:38.670> at

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
air the blower only blows out either at

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
air the blower only blows out either at
the<00:01:39.000> floor<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.930> defrost<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> comes

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the floor or at defrost I think it comes

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.539 
the floor or at defrost I think it comes
out<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> both<00:01:41.820> at<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> same<00:01:42.270> time<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:44.369> they

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
out of both at the same time but they

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
out of both at the same time but they
only<00:01:44.729> work<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.149> floor<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.479> defrost<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.110> get

only work on floor on defrost I get

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
only work on floor on defrost I get
everything<00:01:46.860> else<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.759> change<00:01:48.030> hot<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.509> cold
