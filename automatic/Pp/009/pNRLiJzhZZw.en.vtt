00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.750
 Hello everyone, again, I make a video 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:11.130
 about your 2 oven paws muzzle us 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.130
 works somewhere in mode 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.130
 skoda example oliver can half 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.380
 Well 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 first so you 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.230
 spilling a jet to the floor of a son because wine 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.230
 add 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.640
 I 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.150
 warmed up 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.150
 and repeat again 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.040
 maxim that is 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 a fire will do 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.199
 I love the kind now still show itself exhaust 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.199
 subscriber 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:29.810
 cleaner can not be that is leaving 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:37.600
 the pipe could be colorless at all 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.600
 there's nothing here 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:57.530
 there is nothing small jam 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:01.600
 absolutely there is nothing very burning 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.759
 purely that is, it confirms again 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.100
 the fact that Varlet my selection 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:18.250
 and contact and has incarnate God forbid 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:21.910
 i shows u need sides and see 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.280
 it is up to a small uncork not but so 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.260
 it is not enough to take into account the fact that today Ghanaian 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.190
 bit 32 degrees cold 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.190
 it will evaporate anyway 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.870
 and there is no smoke 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:55.209
 in the gas pipe, that is, as if straight 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.670
 there is no such exhaust at all 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.670
 there is no need to understand that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.609
 off 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.609
 leaves hot 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.730
 and getting cold air anyway 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.470
 wigs over co2 are formed during combustion 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.120
 and water 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.460
 Russian fires occur 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.170
 completely 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.560
 I need the value warmed up consumption all 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.560
 will be 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.370
 involuntarily 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.020
 penny 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.319
 horn of about 25 liters on it 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.290
 that is, I haven't cleaned anything yet 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.060
 knowing 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.060
 too you 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.590
 i.e 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.599
 punched coke a little 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.090
 falling tubes that is unlike 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.239
 without an inflatable stove here coking oil 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.570
 the supply pipe is slower then 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:20.500
 there is here that can be seen yes gives air 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:24.760
 primary oil is supplied falling pipe 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.050
 that is, heats the pyrolysis cup by 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.289
 completely 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.880
 and also it cools the mass of the falling tubes 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.860
 that is, there with us and immediately served 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.860
 due to this coking occurs 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 less like vanity only about a centimeter 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.310
 two can be protrusions 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.220
 tube in the first cup compared with the stove 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.470
 without inflating to us coking occurs on 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:59.060
 all 10 15 centimeters this moment 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.060
 also looks important 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.100
 perhaps I showed the main points 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.270
 there will be questions 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.750
 answer them as they arise 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.990
 maybe after the battle 50 liters 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.280
 analyze and see what is there actually 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.280
 accumulated a box which nagar 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.770
 well then it will be possible her drawing 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.849
 lay out that is 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.540
 to myself 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.580
 i don't see it 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.720
 moments that need to be worked out well 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.720
 There is of course we'll see in general to all for now
