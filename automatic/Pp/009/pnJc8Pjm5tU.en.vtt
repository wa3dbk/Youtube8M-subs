 hello friends with you again I am Dmitry 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 Yegorov and the summer Petersburg sun 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.969
 soft and gentle shines its rays and how 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.870
 would whisper to us let's do 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.179
 next review 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
 well we always follow the sun and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 Meet our new review 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 which is also dedicated to interesting and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 current trends in sneakers 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.240
 but today on the example of a retro model 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.670
 let's start with such a classic super mega 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.980
 classic model like nike blazer 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 remember yes that nike blazer basically this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.690
 first basketball model of the company 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.329
 Nike and today is clear business 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.090
 That basketball is not really not playing 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.559
 but to walk every day etiquette and all 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 also remain very, very 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 popular even now if you remember 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 the German film seducer will be out soon 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 Schweiger om and sneakers there too 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.829
 blazer is true in children's sizes but 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 nike highlighted and we'll talk about these 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.530
 here are 2 very interesting blazer ah 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 high and low model which is made 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.320
 from such an interesting combination as 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 canvas and nubuck laptop in general in this and in 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 next season 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.140
 Circuits from a laptop on sneakers will 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.090
 very relevant and many brands many 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.259
 interesting 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.890
 premium sneaker solutions will be 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.270
 performed just like this blues style 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.430
 can eye for summer 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.140
 Well, it's clear that probably more 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 suitable not to find unless here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.689
 the depth of which we spoke several 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.240
 reviews earlier further color color we see 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.290
 so similar to boiled or shabby 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 denim 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.090
 it is also called such material batik 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 general bate some kind 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.369
 patchy fabric of some such prince 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.100
 unclean camouflage unclean some pattern 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 namely, so that's easy attrition it 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.630
 this season is also very 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.259
 actual therefore should be paid 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.869
 Attention 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.240

 low version too classics and one more 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.590

 Here are such low too, from canvas 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.640
 also such a non uniform color in this 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.860
 gradient coloring times 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 from very light blue to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.230
 dark blue general gradient theme 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.030
 changing here by the tone of the coloring she is very 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.730
 relevant in many models 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.930
 This year's nike is not only Nike and not 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.700

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.390
 these sneakers than they are different 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.520
 from these blades here and very 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.920
 very thin skin unlike this one 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.380
 models that are a bit thicker here 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.200
 very, very thin and another 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.709
 interesting classic model first r 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.500
 max and 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.380
 eighty- seven years old and another 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.850
 times fashionable and execution canvas about 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.130
 which we said previous 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.989
 running shoes here too 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.290
 Something in between Canvas 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.500
 such a fabric base sneakers which 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.480
 there is like a messy pack and more 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.079
 This dark version and for guys 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.540
 who are willing to admit that they never 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.000
 won't let your shoes be dirty here 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.910
 such light sneakers but what's interesting 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.700
 again everything is very verified everything is very 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.380
 good already on the quality of this material 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.360
 it is clear that it is really very good 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.630
 Solid sneakers plus such 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.840
 lightly waxed laces that are perfect 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.239
 fit here a wonderful 2 year old 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.850
 spring if summer and spring models 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.340
 first airmax of and two more pairs 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.430
 sneakers in current trends of this 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.430
 Summer is again the first Airmaks here 2 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.280
 there are such colors here and trend 1 is this 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.230
 mesh between which 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.269
 lately do with such a rough and 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.200
 largely repeats the grid then and how it 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.220
 looked in the 80s 90s they 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.880
 modern so light model 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.519
 plus reflective elements from such 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.079
 material as 3m 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.609
 patented reflective material 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.680
 elements but what are they for 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.810
 to runners who run in the dark 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.550
 Times of Day 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.390
 the car did not accidentally hit them 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.560
 plus the fact that they have such a pure 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.590
 practical meaning they really 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.600
 from such an interesting texture which 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.390
 complements these beautiful sneakers well 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.340
 also why we chose these particular ones 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.140
 two pairs want to mesh quite a lot 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.930
 sneaker options here have it 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.910
 interesting colors 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.250
 so here with a menthol color with a gentle 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.310
 blue which also let's say so 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.320
 mean between brightness and at the same time 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.660
 calm such a balance of colors is 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.770
 which is worth paying attention too in 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.200
 such relevant for this years of movement 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.940
 so if you don't want to be completely 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.770
 hall hostage to his trend of guilt 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.600
 not really for you please 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.610
 pay attention to classic models 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.860
 which there are many in which too 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.960
 some current trends behind 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.330
 which is nice to watch 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.940
 and they look really nice 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.810

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.360
