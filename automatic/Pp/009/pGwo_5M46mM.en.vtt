00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.110
 this video for one has makeup 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.640
 for oily skin 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.900
 and well I will tell you that it is 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.900
 I start with that 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.770
 after that I apply this cream 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.500
 moisturizing 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.200
 and that has cooked me very well is today 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.020
 Refri is very good because it hydrates and 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.760
 I will be free of oil, it hydrates very 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.640
 very well the skin and controls very well the 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.460
 fat apart from this cream and after 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.770
 let it act a few minutes applied the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.350
 milk of magnesia that I can not live without 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.539
 she 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.620
 and after the milk of magnesia I'm going to 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.659
 apply this that is a cream to a base 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.730
 in cream color perfection worships for 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.210
 the face is from avon and it has 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 served me pretty well 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 and I put it before makeup and now 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.120
 I'm going to apply makeup 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.830
 and I'm going to apply the corrector on 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.240
 corrector that I'm using is the super 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.659
 state 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 Four. Five 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.210
 of maybelline and after blurring with 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.210
 a brush I will apply a cream 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.109
 it's terrible 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.659
 logically for combination skin fat and the 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.659
 I will blur very well with a brush 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.299
 pretty good and I'm going to seal this base 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.399
 with translucent powder is very important 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.490
 seal it very well with this powder 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.490
 translucent this will allow us to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.140
 our base will last a long time 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.090
 it lasts me a lot, I say in the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.299
 part where it's getting pretty hot 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.520
 my skin is very very oily and by following 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.590
 these steps to me helps me a lot 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.340
 although my base is being very hot 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.569
 It remains intact for hours and in the afternoon if 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.989
 This is already very bright and I wear 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.520
 with a napkin just taps and 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.510
 very very good 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.160
 I'm going to apply this corrector that 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.930
 they do not have a name 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.060
 nothing has a number you buy a 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.080
 shop the wheel of the commercial store 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.750
 but it serves me very well because it amazes me 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.020
 it lasts for a long time it does not run away 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.570
 perfect cuartea is a very very good 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.940
 corrector I will use this quartet of 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.900
 vision because make a makeup very 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.290
 simple for day 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.959
 quartet of visu and I will use color 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.959
 vanilla that comes 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.890
 I'm going to spread my eyes very well and 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.870
 I tell you, I want to make this video for 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.910
 share with you what it is that I 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.210
 I do to control fat all day 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.310
 because I have suffered a lot with this 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.260
 problem 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.810
 and these steps that I am following are 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.390
 those that work for me very well 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.209

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.650
 only by following these steps the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.319
 makeup lasts me all day 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.349
 I'm going to use this brush 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.159
 blur is like pencil type but it's more 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.500
 loose I'm going to blur the coffee that comes 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.590

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.150
 flush mosaic of Milan 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:19.010
 I really like this blush because 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:22.900
 It leaves a very smooth finish very very 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.740
 very soft like a little tan 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.220
 It's very nice this 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.740

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.740
