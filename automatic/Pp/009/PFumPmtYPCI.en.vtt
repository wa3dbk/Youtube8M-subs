00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi girls today i show you how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 make these pretty decorations 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.690
 such line we can use them as 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 tree or side decorations 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 candles or think of it as gods 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.109
 placeholders now let's see what we need to 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.109
 achieve them 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.920
 then we need shaped spices 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.500
 of star 2 oranges of the sticks of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 pretty long cinnamon ribbon 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.630
 colored the color to taste what time 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.630
 let's see how to do it 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.920
 then we begin to prepare oranges 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.890
 dry to do so we need 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:55.670
 cut an orange into slices of 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:58.510
 thickness of no more than one centimeter one 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.000
 once cut we need 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.869
 put them in the oven let 's rest them on 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.760
 daughter and above the parchment paper and le 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.500
 Bake at 100 to 150 degrees in the oven 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.509
 preheated for about two hours 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.880
 turning them from time to time at the end 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.310
 of the cooking if after two hours they are 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.979
 still soft a little bit up 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.619
 quality we are not seven we take it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.479
 of the scottex paper we lay on the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.970
 oranges and put them on a 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.259
 thermosyphon and let's leave our own 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.259
 well penis 7 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:47.900
 now we look at the whole taking two 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.440
 cinnamon sticks let's put one 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.440
 hot glue 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.610
 we attack them 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:13.140
 we wait 10 seconds for it to happen 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.440
 take it then stick we take the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.040
 ours the launch slice we have 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:31.410
 let dry first in the oven let's put a 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:36.500
 bit of hot glue on the edges e 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.500
 let's stick it here to calm it down 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.269
 we wait for 15 seconds 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.580
 let's take our no's another 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.580
 we do a lot 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.530
 we cut a bridge 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.769
 so we make 12 net points we take 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:33.090
 the ribbon we prefer 2 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.090
 take the scissors and cut me explain 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.950
 good for some glue 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.830
 and split the ribbon 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.280
 over it 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.420
 we always keep 15 seconds 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:17.370
 then we take the formal star spice 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:20.780
 also what we are a bit of glue and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.780
 we attack in the center 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.819
 we wait for the usual seconds 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.919
 and creation is complete 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:50.220
 here is the idea realized as 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:55.720
 placeholder or next to the candles 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:59.850
 as centerpieces and no hope that 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.850
 enjoyed the next hello
