00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.280
 how about friends as they are experience of 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.200
 the best because we are going to make another 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.789
 new video for all of you in this 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.740
 case I bring you this great game 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.939
 what's called world soccer strike a 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.240
 game that has caught my attention 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.580
 very similar to a game that we had already 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.919
 done here but the truth is that it is a 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.050
 very very good game very interesting but 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.480
 good because we're going to start a match 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.750
 nothing more so that showing them is a 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 very simple interface very nice is 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.850
 where are we going to be able to now if it's just a 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.410
 Cascarita one to one but good in this 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.710
 If we compete 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.550
 australia with australia but it is 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.620
 worse so I tell them it's a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.960
 Cascarita so to speak we will be able to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.850
 change uniforms improvements and many things 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.300
 more like that as we go now 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.380
 let's go be advancing you can go 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.020
 complicating 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.200
 Now you can play in modality 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.810
 hard or normal but good in this case 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.930
 because the scenarios are very striking 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.490
 very good and well here the interface is very 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.430
 simple 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.090
 forward backwards jump and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.689
 throw if in this case that what we have 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.450
 what to do then avoid us 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.690
 get a goal where we can do 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.880
 little heads 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.880
 and shoot from medium distance 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.160
 and right now I'm losing 10 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.229
 and then we have tied if they realize 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.860
 shut up I'm full 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 a power bar where we are going to 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.220
 power 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.220
 make a power 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.640
 and then now the truth 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:58.540
 you have to try to put it in the maximum 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.540
 of goals we can in a time limit 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.670
 in this case it seems what power is 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.750
 I here or not 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.290
 Well now we're going 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.310
 losing 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.310
 we are losing 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.069
 then all the time and we're losing 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.319
 and we have lost in this case but then 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.360
 the truth is a striking game that you 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.390
