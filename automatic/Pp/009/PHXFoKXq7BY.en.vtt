00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 and everyone I meet you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.140
 today for one but four 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 special re-entry which is quite discreet 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800
 which in my opinion is pretty happening everywhere 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:21.300
 for all levels 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:23.100
 it's gone to peace so I'm starting 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.740
 first by moisturizing my face 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.800
 it's the base of the base 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.609
 I use the prodigious cream from 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.609
 nuxe of which I am 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.690
 you put the strait 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.710
 cb 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.600
 then I'm going to camouflage my 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.550
 dark circles with dark circles at mac 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.620
 you know him I think I'll you 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.039
 present it more as you see it 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.539
 is archi flair but hey it's because 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.739
 I was not afraid to buy summer morning 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.720
 and in the meantime I tanned 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.670
 so good I apply them in a kind of 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.930
 big cons triangle story becomes 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.879
 fuzzy thema cern women we short circles and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.340
 so is less tired 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.680
 but we say that the view that these 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.560
 whites good do not worry we're gonna 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.149
 correct that after judy also for 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.550
 hide the few imperfections that I 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.020
 could have on my face then 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.869
 then I come to take a brush 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.259
 of high complexion faded a maximum his 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.780
 big demarcation afterwards I 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.729
 make my size mattera quota of home 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.100
 guerlain that I'm going to apply on everything 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.899
 the ideal world I will not hesitate to 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.110
 remove this ghost effect and it was 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.270
 white that is not going at all so I bronze 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.069
 a max the re parts that I have 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.329
 covered hours of concealer 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.329
 I would love to hear 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.030
 of course I will come 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.500
 blur this browser because if you have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.670
 big markdowns and on orange that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 no better than the demarcations 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.030
 White 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.080
 I then go to eyebrows so everything 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.050
 first I brush his eyebrow 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.899
 here and then I come to get the mistletoe 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.220
 migros from benefit and I'm going all 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.080
 just applied this gel seemed 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.100
 eyebrows that will be enough to fill the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.570
 a few things you can 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.280
 find and at the same time for 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.560
 fixed and for the whole day to 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.360
 races did that the two sides otherwise 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.360
 we look a little weak anyway 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.819
 before attacking the eyes I deny them has 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.540
 used a lip balm this one all 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.730
 just a limitation of very bones 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.280
 which my faith works rather well 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.080
 I like good now we will 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.670
 create a smoky look 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.470
 I first apply a basic 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.300
 story to keep my headlights all 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 the day because I do not want that 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.519
 it goes in between folds all that babolat 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.380
 then I come to take this lighthouse matt 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.250
 brown strand dark enough I am very 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.660
 gifted to describe and colors you 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.580
 know but I'm going to apply this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.230
 color in my hollow and I'm coming 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 faded subsequently history 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.799
 to enlarge a little more my eye and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.690
 to define it especially then I like 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.930
 take this coppery pink bowl 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.130
 which is to fall and I'm going to apply it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.080
 in my outer corner 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.390
 all the products I use will be 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.010
 listed in dafoe bar it is chic and that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.959
 so here I apply it in my corner 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.730
 external forming a kind of small v 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.780
 story to lengthen a little more but I 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.019
 you know that I really like doing that 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.720
 and I also apply this lighthouse to 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.579
 level of the outer corner of death does he have where 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.109
 it was weird that then of course gesture 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.660
 just falls ashamed for not that 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.799
 do something too busy then I 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.840
 will take the virgin color of the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.989
 naked one that is a color all 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.010
 simply champagne very clear limit 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.530
 off-white in fact 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.329
 In short, it is to illuminate your eyes 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.950
 so you see the applying corner 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.799
 internal and I'm coming 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.329
 blur all that and there I find that it 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.609
 does a good job anyway 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.709
 has become too clear 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.790
 you subsequently I took to take a 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.859
 brown pencil 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.290
 it will be less heavy than black and I 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.299
 will apply it as if I 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.010
 did a basic pencil line or a 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.340
 eye liner line except that it will be 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.930
 slightly lighter and a little more I 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.489
 do not know how to smoke then I will 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.950
 work but thil and that I love 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.570
 I use the mass mask because of 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.530
 victoria's secret is a worker who has 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.020
 Finally, a non-bros iron 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.690
 that I call an iron actually 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.030
 who does it crazy signs it's 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.010
 by your eyelashes and the extensions it is ouf 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.060
 on the other hand y volume is not that 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.910
 that's why after I'm going to use 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.950
 the volume to deploy from yves rock 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.350
 I work a lot but if he because 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.650
 that I like it too much look at that 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.650
 made 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.020
 Yes, but 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.529
 we put 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.060
 m 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.200
 she said 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.610
 always with this in mind to enlarge 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.250
 the eye and seem a little less 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.220
 tired I'm going to apply pencil 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.720
 white in mucous membranes only at the level 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.340
 from the inside corner and not at the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.800
 external body since at the corner 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.210
 external I put the brown color that 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.270
 will grow a little your eye it will do 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.950
 least I do not know - doll for the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.750
 mouth I chose a nude I remain 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.300
 always in the discreet and that's a 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.700
 jumbo for lip by my record 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.830

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.830
 same time not too marked that I love

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.870
 this blush from at essence the 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.310
 reference to guardrails info because at 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.230
 Actually I remember it but I 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.670
 find that here he is punchy and at the 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.080
 discrete time good should not put too much 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.150
 one because he's so damn flashy 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.670
 anyway but here I love the 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.540
 result of this look 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.520

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.170
 by mentioning and seeing the tone 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.550
 with this look you can be sure that 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.740
 the return you will not pass for the 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.250
