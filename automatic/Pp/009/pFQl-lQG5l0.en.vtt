tried<00:00:30.750> different<00:00:30.960> angles<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.000> what<00:00:33.000> you'll

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
tried different angles and what you'll

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.299 
tried different angles and what you'll
see<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.840> some<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.350> pictures<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
see in some of these pictures is the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.500 
see in some of these pictures is the
most<00:00:35.550> i<00:00:35.700> could<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.450> unit<00:00:37.050> was

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
most i could get out of this unit was

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.560 
most i could get out of this unit was
around<00:00:41.540> 2.1<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.840> watts<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.610> over<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.360> watts

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
around 2.1 to watts to go over to watts

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
around 2.1 to watts to go over to watts
and<00:00:45.870> change<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> single<00:00:47.550> 5<00:00:47.760> volt<00:00:48.770> draw<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and change on a single 5 volt draw so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
and change on a single 5 volt draw so
actually<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> picture<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.410> only

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
actually look at the picture it was only

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.250 
actually look at the picture it was only
four<00:00:52.949> point<00:00:53.219> seven<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:54.000> volts<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.750> point

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
four point seven three volts at point

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.520 
four point seven three volts at point
four<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.559> five<00:00:55.710> amps<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.170> charging

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
four or five amps so what I was charging

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.970 
four or five amps so what I was charging
was<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.399> raft<00:01:00.120> power<00:01:00.390> battery<00:01:00.899> pack<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
was this raft power battery pack that I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520 
was this raft power battery pack that I
picked<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.850> great<00:01:03.449> unit<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> I'll<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
picked up a great unit and I'll do a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.120 
picked up a great unit and I'll do a
quick<00:01:04.799> review<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.700> separately<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
quick review on that one separately and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
quick review on that one separately and
so<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.430> thought<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:08.880> maybe<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
so then I thought well maybe it's you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
so then I thought well maybe it's you
know<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> angle<00:01:10.439> i<00:01:10.890> tried<00:01:11.130> different<00:01:11.310> angles

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
know the angle i tried different angles

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
know the angle i tried different angles
i<00:01:12.119> tried<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> couple<00:01:13.260> different<00:01:13.439> things<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
i tried a couple different things and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.940 
i tried a couple different things and
then<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:14.549> did<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.210> i<00:01:15.240> did<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> similar<00:01:16.470> test

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
then what i did is i did a similar test

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
then what i did is i did a similar test
off<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.970> macbook<00:01:18.420> pro<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:19.049> has<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> USB<00:01:19.970> 3

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
off of my macbook pro which has a USB 3

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
off of my macbook pro which has a USB 3
charging<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.900> USB<00:01:23.060> 3<00:01:24.060> port<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
charging or USB 3 port on it and the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
charging or USB 3 port on it and the
last<00:01:26.430> picture<00:01:26.700> you'll<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
last picture you'll see here is that the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.640 
last picture you'll see here is that the
unit<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:29.009> able<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> draw<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:31.140> wrath<00:01:31.290> power

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
unit was able to draw the wrath power

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.420 
unit was able to draw the wrath power
was<00:01:32.100> able<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> draw<00:01:32.880> 5<00:01:33.210> volts<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.890> 1.06<00:01:34.890> amps

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
was able to draw 5 volts at 1.06 amps

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060 
was able to draw 5 volts at 1.06 amps
which<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> little<00:01:37.500> over<00:01:37.860> five

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
which is you know a little over five

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.789 
which is you know a little over five
watts<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.409> thought<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.680> interesting

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
watts so thought that was interesting

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490 
watts so thought that was interesting
wanted<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> share<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.869> it's<00:01:42.869> pretty<00:01:43.229> durable

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
wanted to share that it's pretty durable

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.649 
wanted to share that it's pretty durable

go up past what you're seeing there do
some<00:02:10.319> more<00:02:10.440> testing<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.250> wanted<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> get

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
some more testing but just wanted to get

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.020 
some more testing but just wanted to get
my<00:02:11.670> initial<00:02:12.120> thoughts<00:02:12.330> around<00:02:12.629> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
my initial thoughts around it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.120 
my initial thoughts around it
I<00:02:13.090> know<00:02:13.480> there's<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> lot<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.290> variables<00:02:14.860> right

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
I know there's a lot of variables right

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.990 
I know there's a lot of variables right
you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.430> angles<00:02:15.940> time<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:17.020> year<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.970> know

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
you know angles time of year you know

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.360 
you know angles time of year you know
the<00:02:19.240> unit<00:02:19.630> itself<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:20.230> know<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> rav<00:02:20.620> power

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the unit itself you know the rav power

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.570 
the unit itself you know the rav power
what<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:22.410> requesting<00:02:23.410> based<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.280> what<00:02:24.459> it's

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
what it's requesting based on what it's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.040 
what it's requesting based on what it's
seen<00:02:24.850> from<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.160> output<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.819> those<00:02:28.180> USB<00:02:28.510> ports

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
seen from the output of those USB ports

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.460 
seen from the output of those USB ports
so<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.640> know<00:02:30.730> nothing<00:02:31.180> scientific<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.230> again

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
so you know nothing scientific but again

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.280 
so you know nothing scientific but again
just<00:02:32.500> my<00:02:32.830> initial<00:02:33.040> reaction<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.700> wanted<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
just my initial reaction is wanted to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.990 
just my initial reaction is wanted to
measure<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.680> how<00:02:36.010> well<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.400> performed

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
measure and see how well this performed

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.059 
measure and see how well this performed
