00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.350
 hello friends welcome once again yesterday 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.370
 br igor channel this is the tutorial of 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.250
 dribbles of roulette or 360 as you want 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.820
 call it this style this dodge like 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.830
 want is a skill of three stars and 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.960
 to do it is very simple well 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.869
 simple you have to take the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.449
 analogue right and turn the ten of 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.270
 back towards one of the player's sides 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.720
 making a three movement of forgiveness 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 360 of 270 degrees and talking in 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.120
 geometry notice that the player when what 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.460
 does it's going to rotate at 45 degrees 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.649
 that's jumping at 45 degrees its 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.690
 trajectory towards the side that we choose 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.109
 and look, I'm already showing in the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.649

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:57.109
 easy and a chip for you is not 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.170
 necessary to do 270 degrees as it is 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.899
 indicated in the official help of the law if 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.950
 you do 180 degrees the player already 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.320

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.980
 skil and well this is who can be 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.130
 made with the player stopped or running 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.450
 at any speed and I recommend them 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.970
 much are you gil for when they are in 11 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.220
 with the opponent or kate one against one 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.490
 and it's a skill that as you can 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.880
