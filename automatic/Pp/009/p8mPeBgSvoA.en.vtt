 is spreading its wings to new 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.890

 domestic and deploys to the flights 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.630
 international welcome the big 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.189
 public is an issue a challenge 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 you've been getting ready since she got 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.440
 launched in domestic flights in March 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.239
 2013 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.890
 an opening that was made in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.680
 coordination with the air company 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 algeria talent has so far assured the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
 transport of sonatrach staff and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 foreign oil companies 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.199
 since 1998 tassili so we wanted him 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.850
 develop other activities of 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.489
 transport in it was doing 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.550
 essentially until 2011 of late 2011 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.680
 2000 2012 she was she is still 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.479
 that is, dedicated to transport 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.269
 be variable such hydrocarbons 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.250
 we think it's an element that 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.769
 for us is advantageous the second 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.630
 thing we said since we have a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.250
 company that makes that transport that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 will allow us to profit from our 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 planes to give it more experience 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 to our crews at our abalo 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 and open it to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 open activities gaulon public talent 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.170
 was created in 1998 an agreement between 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.300
 sonatrach and air Algeria before 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 become a wholly owned subsidiary of the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.930
 Sonatrach in 2005 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 the company today has 31 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.290
 planes since April 2014 has resulted in 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.130
 this process which allowed us to have 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.000
 the company tassili with 12 planes so 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 essentially focused on 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 public transport charter year 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.230
 tourism and its hydrocarbons too 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.550
 and at the same time we have this 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.440
 subsidiary that belongs to us since 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.690
 we gave up the work planes 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.820
 well in the frame let's say of a 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.520
 structuring in regulatory status 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.410
 such etc and logged and that's how 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.420
 Since April we have two companions 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.060
 and in fact we have tassili transport 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.860
 who the parent company and we have been 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.420
 to our will facilitate the second company 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.380
 national government has a fleet and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.320
 sheds subject to standards 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.630
 international security 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.420
 perform aircraft maintenance and a 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.830
 certain non- international number which 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.490
 are required national and 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.650
 international which are required so he 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.850
 Prices are names for cleanliness 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.870
 lighting the air conditioning so that 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.910
 the people who work and the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.500
 labor technicians were not in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.250
 uncomfortable to run in now 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.410
 which is a very very delicate task 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.090
 throughout his life he accumulates 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.700
 hours and cycles of the sites 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.230
 landing and flying hours and at 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.159
 each 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.170
 opportunity we generate a program a 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.560
 protocol to run a series 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.209
 inspections of changes in 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.980
 checks and this is the second 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.680
 metal category what does that is 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.110
 curative maintenance 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.840
 it's things that are without any unexpected 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.599
 so the driver the signal technician 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.549
 sign to that of his faults and it takes 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.129
 immediately treated by the teams 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.870

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.109
 collaboration with the airline 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.569
