great about it bugs I don't mean insects

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.580 
great about it bugs I don't mean insects
I<00:04:21.580> mean<00:04:21.760> programming<00:04:22.510> bugs<00:04:22.750> there<00:04:23.080> are<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.289> lot

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
I mean programming bugs there are a lot

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.080 
I mean programming bugs there are a lot
of<00:04:23.620> them<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:23.979> this<00:04:24.100> game<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.610> could<00:04:24.760> be<00:04:24.850> little

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
of them in this game it could be little

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.670 
of them in this game it could be little
things<00:04:25.390> like<00:04:25.600> when<00:04:25.780> my<00:04:25.900> character<00:04:25.960> knocked<00:04:26.530> on

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
things like when my character knocked on

things like when my character knocked on
a<00:04:26.710> door<00:04:26.770> showed<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.220> close-up<00:04:27.700> of<00:04:27.820> his

a door showed a close-up of his
and<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.650> was<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> Redcoat<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.460> I'm<00:04:29.520> like<00:04:29.700> my<00:04:30.030> guy

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
and it was a Redcoat and I'm like my guy

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.120 
and it was a Redcoat and I'm like my guy
is<00:04:30.270> not<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.600> Redcoat<00:04:30.990> nor<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.500> he<00:04:31.650> wearing<00:04:31.890> a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
is not a Redcoat nor is he wearing a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
coat that is remotely read so why was

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.960 
coat that is remotely read so why was
that<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.620> Redcoat<00:04:35.040> then<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:35.460> are<00:04:35.520> other<00:04:35.670> bugs

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
that a Redcoat then there are other bugs

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.820 
that a Redcoat then there are other bugs
like<00:04:36.210> it's<00:04:36.390> hard<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.660> pick<00:04:36.990> items<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.590> that

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
like it's hard to pick items up that

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.410 
like it's hard to pick items up that
shouldn't<00:04:38.160> be<00:04:38.220> too<00:04:38.400> hard<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.700> pick<00:04:38.910> up<00:04:39.090> another

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
shouldn't be too hard to pick up another

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.150 
shouldn't be too hard to pick up another
example<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:40.050> one<00:04:40.200> character<00:04:40.560> was<00:04:40.710> talking<00:04:41.100> to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
example is one character was talking to

me<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.400> his<00:04:41.520> mouth<00:04:41.730> wasn't<00:04:42.030> moving<00:04:42.330> he's<00:04:42.570> just

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
me and his mouth wasn't moving he's just

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.120 
me and his mouth wasn't moving he's just
like<00:04:42.900> right<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.140> are<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.440> ready<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.800> move<00:04:43.920> out

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
like right so are you ready to move out

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.470 
like right so are you ready to move out
we're<00:04:44.400> going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> go<00:04:44.700> there<00:04:44.910> we're<00:04:45.120> gonna<00:04:45.180> kill

we're going to go there we're gonna kill

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.730 
we're going to go there we're gonna kill
these<00:04:45.630> people<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.200> couple<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.620> these

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
these people and a couple of these

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.290 
these people and a couple of these
glitches<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.340> game<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:47.700> this<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:48.150> would

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
glitches in a game like this I would

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.880 
glitches in a game like this I would
understand<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.110> enough<00:04:49.380> happened<00:04:49.800> in

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
understand that but enough happened in

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.470 
understand that but enough happened in
this<00:04:50.010> game<00:04:50.070> toward<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:50.940> apparently<00:04:51.300> worth

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
this game toward it's apparently worth

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.000 
this game toward it's apparently worth
addressing<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.050> my<00:04:52.140> video<00:04:52.410> just<00:04:52.680> like<00:04:52.860> these

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
addressing in my video just like these

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.800 
addressing in my video just like these
little<00:04:53.310> frustrations<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.300> are<00:04:54.420> in<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.660> game

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
little frustrations that are in the game

little frustrations that are in the game
where<00:04:54.990> you're<00:04:55.080> like<00:04:55.230> why<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.800> bugged<00:04:56.010> but

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
where you're like why is it bugged but

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.430 
where you're like why is it bugged but
game<00:04:56.550> developers<00:04:57.060> apparently<00:04:57.540> don't<00:04:57.840> realize

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
game developers apparently don't realize

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.740 
game developers apparently don't realize
is<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.710> seed<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.220> doubt<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.880> bugs<00:05:00.120> plant<00:05:00.570> in

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
is the seed of doubt that bugs plant in

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.150 
is the seed of doubt that bugs plant in
the<00:05:00.810> players<00:05:01.050> brain<00:05:01.470> because<00:05:01.890> then<00:05:02.040> I'll<00:05:02.130> be

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
the players brain because then I'll be

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.010 
the players brain because then I'll be
going<00:05:02.430> I'm<00:05:02.730> not<00:05:02.940> wanted<00:05:03.480> i'm<00:05:03.690> totally

ass and I think to myself well did I do
something<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.230> make<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.530> happen<00:05:10.890> or<00:05:11.070> is<00:05:11.190> that

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
something to make that happen or is that

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.650 
something to make that happen or is that
just<00:05:11.370> another<00:05:11.580> game<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.330> mean<00:05:12.480> if<00:05:12.540> there

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
just another game but I mean if there

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.150 
just another game but I mean if there
were<00:05:12.750> no<00:05:12.930> game<00:05:13.200> bugs<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.710> game<00:05:13.740> I'd<00:05:14.070> be

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
were no game bugs in the game I'd be

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.770 
were no game bugs in the game I'd be
like<00:05:14.280> oh<00:05:14.430> yeah<00:05:14.670> my<00:05:14.850> character<00:05:15.210> has<00:05:15.360> dark<00:05:15.630> skin

like oh yeah my character has dark skin
its<00:05:16.110> colonial<00:05:16.560> America<00:05:16.950> so<00:05:17.070> they're<00:05:17.190> gonna

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
its colonial America so they're gonna

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.840 
its colonial America so they're gonna
kick<00:05:17.520> my<00:05:17.640> ass

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
kick my ass

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.480

racist<00:05:18.480> NPCs<00:05:19.230> my<00:05:19.500> mind<00:05:19.740> would<00:05:19.950> go<00:05:20.100> there<00:05:20.310> but

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
racist NPCs my mind would go there but

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.100 
racist NPCs my mind would go there but
since<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.790> saw<00:05:21.030> glitches<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:21.660> bugs<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:21.990> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
since I saw glitches and bugs in the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.840 
since I saw glitches and bugs in the
game<00:05:22.140> I<00:05:22.470> now<00:05:22.620> have<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.920> think<00:05:22.950> of<00:05:23.250> myself<00:05:23.340> was

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
game I now have to think of myself was

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.310 
game I now have to think of myself was
that<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> bug<00:05:24.360> really<00:05:24.750> takes<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.080> out<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.200> the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
that a bug really takes you out of the
