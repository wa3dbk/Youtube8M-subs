Charlotte Charlotte takeaway about

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.210 
Charlotte Charlotte takeaway about
making<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.180> music<00:04:25.510> video<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.260> think<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
making a music video is I think the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.400 
making a music video is I think the
hardest<00:04:27.250> thing<00:04:27.910> about<00:04:27.940> making<00:04:28.419> music<00:04:28.870> videos

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
hardest thing about making music videos

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.530 
hardest thing about making music videos
is<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:29.980> days<00:04:30.220> are<00:04:30.550> absolutely<00:04:31.210> massive

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
is that the days are absolutely massive

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.120 
is that the days are absolutely massive
days<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:32.110> they're<00:04:32.230> so<00:04:32.380> long<00:04:32.530> like<00:04:32.740> we<00:04:32.860> did<00:04:32.980> an

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
days that they're so long like we did an

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.940 
days that they're so long like we did an
18<00:04:33.490> hour<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.760> a<00:04:33.790> 14-hour<00:04:34.330> day<00:04:34.570> for<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.500> first

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
18 hour and a 14-hour day for the first

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.800 
18 hour and a 14-hour day for the first
one<00:04:36.160> I<00:04:36.190> think<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.490> was<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.480> only<00:04:37.660> thing

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
one I think it was but the only thing

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.850 
one I think it was but the only thing
was<00:04:37.930> we<00:04:38.080> were<00:04:38.110> chilling<00:04:38.470> out<00:04:38.560> on<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.710> beach

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
was we were chilling out on the beach

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.560 
was we were chilling out on the beach
all<00:04:39.040> day<00:04:39.190> then<00:04:39.340> we<00:04:39.550> got<00:04:39.669> sunburned<00:04:40.150> because<00:04:40.479> we

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
all day then we got sunburned because we

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.730 
all day then we got sunburned because we
were<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.840> beach<00:04:40.930> for<00:04:41.169> that<00:04:41.290> long<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.620> was

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
were on the beach for that long that was

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.110 
were on the beach for that long that was
just<00:04:41.889> like<00:04:41.979> but<00:04:42.130> they're<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.460> much<00:04:42.610> fun<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:43.000> do

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
just like but they're so much fun to do

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.370 
just like but they're so much fun to do
especially<00:04:43.570> when<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:43.870> get<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.139> chill

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
especially when you just get to chill

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.690 
especially when you just get to chill
out<00:04:44.470> on<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.590> beach<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:45.190> suppose<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.669> other

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
out on the beach I suppose the other

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.980 
out on the beach I suppose the other
difficult<00:04:46.120> thing<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.450> have<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.750> really

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
difficult thing is you have to really

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.140 
difficult thing is you have to really
lose<00:04:47.350> yourself<00:04:47.800> in<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.460> song<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:48.970> in<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
lose yourself in the song and in the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.690 
lose yourself in the song and in the
moment<00:04:49.510> because<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:50.650> know<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.800> can't<00:04:51.100> not<00:04:51.550> be
