this is a Wi-Fi only tablet but let's
get<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.130> real<00:01:30.340> reason<00:01:31.090> why<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.240> would

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
get to the real reason why you would

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.270 
get to the real reason why you would
want<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.750> tablet<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.560> saw<00:01:32.740> me<00:01:32.890> holding<00:01:33.040> a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
want this tablet you saw me holding a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.670 
want this tablet you saw me holding a
pendant<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.880> see<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> pen<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.229> background

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
pendant I see a pen in the background

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.040 
pendant I see a pen in the background
and<00:01:36.550> that's<00:01:36.729> because<00:01:36.910> this<00:01:37.330> has<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.570> screen

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
and that's because this has a screen

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.980 
and that's because this has a screen
that<00:01:38.350> accepts<00:01:39.009> pen<00:01:39.399> input<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.600> now<00:01:40.720> when<00:01:40.899> you

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
that accepts pen input so now when you

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.200 
that accepts pen input so now when you
go<00:01:41.140> into<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.830> pen<00:01:42.160> app<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.550> see<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.030> had
