00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
I'm I'm assuming that this is coming

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.110 
I'm I'm assuming that this is coming
down<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.800> road<00:05:03.889> now<00:05:04.099> for<00:05:04.280> those<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.729> you<00:05:04.940> who

down the road now for those of you who

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.629 
down the road now for those of you who
might<00:05:05.750> know<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.020> bit<00:05:06.349> about<00:05:06.380> this<00:05:06.860> program<00:05:07.130> if

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
might know a bit about this program if

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.730 
might know a bit about this program if
you<00:05:07.760> hold<00:05:08.090> down<00:05:08.210> long<00:05:08.659> it'll<00:05:09.199> give<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:09.590> the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
you hold down long it'll give you the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.820 
you hold down long it'll give you the
option<00:05:10.510> play<00:05:11.510> using<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.470> it'll<00:05:12.680> have<00:05:12.800> a

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
option play using and it'll have a

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.740 
option play using and it'll have a
hardware<00:05:13.280> software<00:05:13.580> or<00:05:14.060> software<00:05:14.389> decoder

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
hardware software or software decoder

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.339 
hardware software or software decoder
fast<00:05:15.370> I'm<00:05:16.370> just<00:05:16.789> typically<00:05:17.300> using<00:05:17.900> software

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
fast I'm just typically using software

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.089 
fast I'm just typically using software
decoder<00:05:20.320> like<00:05:21.320> I<00:05:21.440> said<00:05:21.500> things<00:05:21.830> will<00:05:22.039> get

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
decoder like I said things will get

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.500 
decoder like I said things will get
better<00:05:22.250> as<00:05:22.460> they<00:05:22.610> go<00:05:22.729> along<00:05:22.820> alpha<00:05:23.389> alpha

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
better as they go along alpha alpha

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.409 
better as they go along alpha alpha
alpha<00:05:23.780> alpha<00:05:24.190> okay<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.880> let's<00:05:26.090> see<00:05:26.270> what<00:05:26.300> else

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
alpha alpha okay so let's see what else

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.350 
alpha alpha okay so let's see what else
we<00:05:26.690> can<00:05:26.720> do<00:05:26.990> in<00:05:27.229> terms<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.919> video<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:28.820> guess<00:05:29.210> we

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
we can do in terms of video I guess we

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.839 
we can do in terms of video I guess we
might<00:05:29.510> as<00:05:29.570> well<00:05:29.720> touch<00:05:30.050> on<00:05:30.229> netflix<00:05:30.820> now<00:05:31.820> I
