comes<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.740> walking<00:02:06.130> but<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:06.729> don't<00:02:07.000> quit

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
comes to walking but they don't quit

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.949 
comes to walking but they don't quit
they<00:02:08.920> keep<00:02:09.130> trying<00:02:09.429> they<00:02:09.700> fall<00:02:10.030> they<00:02:10.630> learn

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
they keep trying they fall they learn

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.260 
they keep trying they fall they learn
they<00:02:11.590> get<00:02:11.800> up<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.190> again<00:02:12.340> they<00:02:12.819> may<00:02:13.000> cry

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
they get up and do it again they may cry

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.640 
they get up and do it again they may cry
a<00:02:13.300> little<00:02:13.569> bit<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.050> you'll<00:02:14.200> get<00:02:14.319> up<00:02:14.470> and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
a little bit but then you'll get up and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.080 
a little bit but then you'll get up and
they'll<00:02:15.099> laugh<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.610> they'll<00:02:15.730> try<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:15.970> again

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
they'll laugh and they'll try it again

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.430 
they'll laugh and they'll try it again
and<00:02:16.390> they'll<00:02:16.510> giggle<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.900> wobble<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.290> give

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
and they'll giggle and wobble and give

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.809 
and they'll giggle and wobble and give
you<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> cute<00:02:17.860> smile<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.190> then<00:02:18.490> they'll<00:02:18.610> fall

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
you a cute smile and then they'll fall

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.670 
you a cute smile and then they'll fall
and<00:02:19.060> cry<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.959> they<00:02:20.110> get<00:02:20.230> up<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.500> they<00:02:20.590> do

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and cry and then they get up and they do

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.030 
and cry and then they get up and they do
it<00:02:20.890> again<00:02:20.970> they<00:02:21.970> don't<00:02:22.150> quit<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.530> baby<00:02:23.770> step

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
it again they don't quit so a baby step

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.520 
it again they don't quit so a baby step
isn't<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.670> tiny<00:02:25.090> short<00:02:25.810> step<00:02:26.170> with

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
isn't just a tiny short step with

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.649 
isn't just a tiny short step with
stability<00:02:26.890> with<00:02:27.760> competence<00:02:28.299> all<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.510> know<00:02:28.569> I

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
stability with competence all I know I

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.330 
stability with competence all I know I
can<00:02:28.959> take<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> short<00:02:29.500> step<00:02:29.739> because<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.069> know<00:02:30.129> how

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
can take a short step because I know how

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.380 
can take a short step because I know how
to<00:02:30.400> walk<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.670> I'm<00:02:30.879> not<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.209> worry<00:02:31.329> about

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
to walk and I'm not going to worry about

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.280 
to walk and I'm not going to worry about
falling

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
falling

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.459 
falling
so<00:02:32.469> I'll<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.620> take<00:02:32.920> little<00:02:33.129> steps<00:02:33.340> no<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.469> baby

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
so I'll just take little steps no a baby

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.459 
so I'll just take little steps no a baby
step<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.129> risk<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:37.000> baby<00:02:37.659> step<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.170> where<00:02:38.349> you

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
step is a risk a baby step is where you

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.690 
step is a risk a baby step is where you
go<00:02:38.620> out<00:02:38.829> of<00:02:39.269> balance<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.599> little<00:02:41.290> step<00:02:41.700> so

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
go out of balance on a little step so

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.580 
go out of balance on a little step so
you're<00:02:42.969> not<00:02:43.090> too<00:02:43.540> far<00:02:43.900> out<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.170> balance<00:02:44.409> you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
you're not too far out of balance you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.679 
you're not too far out of balance you
don't<00:02:44.769> get<00:02:44.890> hurt<00:02:45.069> badly<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:46.239> might<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.540> get

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
don't get hurt badly you might just get

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.809 
don't get hurt badly you might just get
a<00:02:46.750> little<00:02:46.840> booboo<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:48.400> you're<00:02:48.549> going<00:02:48.730> to

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
a little booboo but you're going to

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.309 
a little booboo but you're going to
wobble<00:02:49.060> you're<00:02:49.629> going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:49.989> out<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.140> balance

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
wobble you're going to be out of balance

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.020 
wobble you're going to be out of balance
you're<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.189> to<00:02:51.280> fall<00:02:51.489> but<00:02:51.730> you're<00:02:51.879> going<00:02:51.970> to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
you're going to fall but you're going to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360 
you're going to fall but you're going to
learn<00:02:52.239> from<00:02:52.599> it<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.069> you're<00:02:54.069> going<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.250> learn

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
learn from it and you're going to learn

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.220 
learn from it and you're going to learn
competence<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.269> you're<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.140> become

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
competence and you're going to become

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.390 
competence and you're going to become
more<00:02:56.620> confident<00:02:57.340> as<00:02:57.489> well<00:02:58.470> because<00:02:59.470> through

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
more confident as well because through

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.099 
more confident as well because through
this<00:03:00.609> learning<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.359> being<00:03:01.599> out<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.780> balance

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
this learning of being out of balance

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.220 
this learning of being out of balance
you'll<00:03:03.099> find<00:03:03.370> your<00:03:03.639> center<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.180> gravity<00:03:04.269> I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
you'll find your center of gravity I

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.610 
you'll find your center of gravity I
talked<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.129> lot<00:03:06.310> about<00:03:06.370> gravity<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.090> my<00:03:07.209> videos

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
talked a lot about gravity in my videos

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.059 
talked a lot about gravity in my videos
where<00:03:08.620> are<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.189> pulled<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.989> your<00:03:11.560> Center

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
where are you pulled what is your Center

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.360 
where are you pulled what is your Center
what<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.669> your<00:03:13.000> mass<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:14.680> do<00:03:14.829> you<00:03:14.919> attract

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
what is your mass what do you attract

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.240 
what is your mass what do you attract
into<00:03:15.849> your<00:03:15.879> life<00:03:16.180> that's<00:03:17.139> your<00:03:17.319> gravity<00:03:17.739> your

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
into your life that's your gravity your

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
center of gravity that's your truth

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.289 
center of gravity that's your truth
that's<00:03:20.169> who<00:03:20.379> you<00:03:20.590> are<00:03:20.620> underneath<00:03:21.579> all<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:22.180> BS

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
that's who you are underneath all the BS

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.589 
that's who you are underneath all the BS
underneath<00:03:22.930> all<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.409> delusions<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.599> you

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
underneath all the delusions and you

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.300 
underneath all the delusions and you
find<00:03:25.930> your<00:03:26.109> center<00:03:26.379> of<00:03:26.439> gravity<00:03:26.530> by<00:03:27.010> getting

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
find your center of gravity by getting

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.399 
find your center of gravity by getting
out<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.549> balance<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.090> finding<00:03:29.049> out<00:03:29.169> where

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
out of balance and finding out where

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.979 
out of balance and finding out where
that<00:03:29.560> balance<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.189> by<00:03:31.120> learning<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.569> be<00:03:31.750> stable

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
that balance is by learning to be stable

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.289 
that balance is by learning to be stable
and<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.379> requires<00:03:32.769> risks<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.879> requires

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
and that requires risks that requires

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.740 
and that requires risks that requires
falling<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:35.409> requires<00:03:35.739> little<00:03:36.099> boo-boos<00:03:36.750> so

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
falling that requires little boo-boos so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.689 
falling that requires little boo-boos so
when<00:03:37.900> you're<00:03:38.019> taking<00:03:38.199> these<00:03:38.650> little<00:03:39.129> baby

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
when you're taking these little baby

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.229 
when you're taking these little baby
steps<00:03:40.150> they're<00:03:40.419> not<00:03:40.569> just<00:03:40.780> short<00:03:41.199> steps

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
steps they're not just short steps

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.270 
steps they're not just short steps
they're<00:03:43.239> short<00:03:43.540> steps<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.530> are<00:03:44.560> wobbly<00:03:45.099> and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
they're short steps that are wobbly and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.759 
they're short steps that are wobbly and
out<00:03:45.699> of<00:03:45.879> balance<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.449> they<00:03:46.870> involve<00:03:47.199> risk

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
out of balance and they involve risk

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.879 
out of balance and they involve risk
with<00:03:48.760> just<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.030> little<00:03:49.150> bit<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.769> then<00:03:50.769> you

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
with just a little bit and then you

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.129 
with just a little bit and then you
learn<00:03:51.040> something<00:03:51.459> from<00:03:51.849> that<00:03:52.269> risk<00:03:52.690> you
