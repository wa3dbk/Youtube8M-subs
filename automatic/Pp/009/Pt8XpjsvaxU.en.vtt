00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello everyone, all welcome to the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.790
 review of Naruto's 699 manga 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.740
 effectively this is the next 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.230
 chapter and basically decided to separate 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.450
 the reviews of manga 699 with the review 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.620
 of the 700 manga basically because last 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.450
 manga so I read it has some 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 forty and forty pages and so on 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.260
 took advantage and tried to make a light 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 reaction of the last chapter not 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.830
 basically to me reading as well as a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.869
 delay and seeing my reactions that to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 sometimes they are quite epic so nothing 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.210
 has commented on this introduction we are going to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 comment a little bit more about the parts 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.000
 highlighted in this chapter that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 honestly it is a chapter a little more 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 of relax to finish the series 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.710
 little by little and first of all I do not know if 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 you will have noticed but we can see 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 indeed that's the way of fucking 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.260
 magic that figure let go to maya that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.090
 wooden figure that they had destroyed 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 naruto is us that with this battle already 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 united but with fact is a kind of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 of two in plan is the inseparable tie 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.559
 who is currently suffering a mourning 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.210
 things that and who have suffered these 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.250
 throughout the series we also see here 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 a little because that cure woke up does 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.670
 two sleeves and really ask me in the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.219
 previous sleeve why the fuck not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 intervened and basically if in this manga 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.570
 has intervened and really though 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 It seems weird if you have done something very useful and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.659
 is the fact of getting that in artists 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.249
 Do not die as we remember 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.229
 everyone had the arm totally 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:11.609
 mutilated brasi say it and besides that that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.899
 arm mutilated because it did not stop bleeding 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.240
 and if that bleeding did not stop 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.799
 really these two were going to die so 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 thanks to the healing of that cure 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.399
 if it has stopped the bleeding of the car 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.259
 sales that has already gotten these two 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.939
 do not die so well done to cure 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.619
 this time everything and the positive to you and it 's 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.119
 that shusaku that we see here has also 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.890
 been pretty peak now that if 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.689
 we remember that several sleeves ago we saw 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.969
 as those who were already completely 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 the sakura love and here we see how it 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.479
 reaffirms a little more stress to their 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.130
 go to that somehow you know that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.750
 apology with sakura and in fact here is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.879
 a portion in which the question heals 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.670
 is that because this is really I think 

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.140
 which is for seven handles to take out 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.119
 more your feelings not because it's me 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.619
 I apologize sakura that does not ensure that see 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.299
 a little more the feelings of those that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.709
 you will see what you will have a little more and 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.119
 that's because of the fact that I think that 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.829
 he has asked why is he 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 currently apologetically as if 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.579
 we see that he apologizes for the damage that 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.859
 has made that cure and all that shit and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.079
 really here he gives a sakura headshot 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.729
 handles that since it says problematic 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.319
 stupid 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.479
 and the last character that was missing by 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.489
 evangelize this series that those that then 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.230
 yes you basically know that it appears like this the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.180
 last evangelized I said 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.650
 700 but if apparently that is what has 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.120
 been the last evangelized since the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.010
 you know you're starting to feel 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.599
 his feelings that naruto day told him 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.010
 that break the vote because I felt these 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.510
 as if he were a brother no and here in 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 this manga confirms us you know that he 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.900
 he is also feeling that brother bond 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.549
 well you know it's about time it's not that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 really evangelize you like this 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.940
 account of that relationship of brothers someone 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.099
 auto is referring to talking 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.069
 with you we will see when it lasts for this 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.989
 bipolar this attitude so good so 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.709
 fully understood the feelings of 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.629
 naruto 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.980
 We'll see how long it lasts and because this one 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.629
 we know that what is said is a bit bipolar 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.220
 and maybe it will be by a way then by 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.959
 the other something changes this man you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.730
 you can expect everything really and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.319
 obviously we see that everyone has left 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.540
 its whose very infinite that is wrong there 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.890
 everyone there sleeping with their dreams already 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.510
 they have arrived is like this in something they use 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.099
 totally fucked the dreams and they have 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.420
 rid of this his whose infinite and my 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.160
 about this being an opening 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.810
 buds and that all are coming out of 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.489
 your dreams I want to highlight one thing and it's 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.140
 the fact that focus on innate 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.579
 just opening the cocoon and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.739
 they are also focuses on an image in 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.690
 the one we see at a funeral to Naruto and 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.129
 aina is together not how reaffirming 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.500
 a little in hallucinates yes and has received 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.269
 spoiler a little bit for the comments that 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.890
 I have seen and by the people that I am 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.870
 subscribed that follows effectively 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.550
 in flour, yes they will have children 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.380
 what I know that fuck the read that 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.090
 basically I spoiler a bit prey 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.340
 parts and that said we see here a little 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.080
 more in hallucinates with naruto and cream in the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.910
 funeral and aina is focusing 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.890
 just when it comes out of the cocoon 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.360
 of zhouqu I infinite and something happens very 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.070
 strange and that is that we see there killed 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.540
 taking off that mask that is a 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.070
 incognito because it's like kishimoto 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.870
 did not launch that the one that was after that 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.220
 mask giving by sack in it killed and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.840
 really the only thing we have seen in 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.940
 this chapter is that that mask like 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.160
 that is let go of call and let go of 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.750
 Yamato like the mask is undone 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.980
 it's like the mask is controlling 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.060
 to the call and that's why she 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.680
 killed has done all these actions 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.810
 malignant or something like that made me understand 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.610
 this manga and something that has done a lot 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 well kishimoto in this manga is to see 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.570
 really a dream fulfilled by naruto and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.459
 a promise that he made to that cure 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.260
 and it is to see that he has reconciled with sas 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.510
 that is indeed everything they are already like 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.100
 together and that dream I said about that 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.660
 cure or that promise he made a route 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.130
 sure to bring those back 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.660
 It has been fulfilled since I said it 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.890
 we have seen in this magician how do you know that 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.510
 He has effectively returned to the villa 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.829
 hidden from the sheet and that's really what 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.660
 I like that very much because it's like 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.460
 that those efforts and that promise have 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.320
 come to break and in this manga we can 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.400
 observe a small timer and put when 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.110
 they place everyone 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.750
 and hidden from the sheet and we see as if 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.190
 indeed is almost the sixth judge 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.080
 in fact to taste quite as it has 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.539
 seen reflected the face of the jockey himself 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.919
 what's in that rock and why the fucking 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.750
 those that after everything he has done 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.000
 after bursting or trying 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.800
 burst naruto and eye careful and try 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.270
 kill him look is has been released in 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.550
 more always like he does not want the thing 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.350
 It is because it has obviously helped 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.810
 save everyone from your infinite my wedge 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.600
 then the justification according to them is 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.490
 enough to avoid that prison that 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.229
 would correspond to sas that in case 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.030
 this new one would have freed all of 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.830
 the hands of sex whose infinite my 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.360
 if indeed the arm of these 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.070
 remain shrub has been rebuilt 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.720
 thanks to the cells leaves sinama that 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.039
 degrade to implement them and so to 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.780
 look like they have managed to restore 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.729
 both arms so many people and me 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.889
 is speculating that if I was going save 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.600
 the arms of these two was going to be sakura 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.100
 and it's going to be something related together I said 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.199
 that best correlated with 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.060
 ability of the one who accused that he 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.860
 allowed to sew the arm and such something 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.570
 related to that and it's not really 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.910
 basically by the mere fact of the 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.130
 cells that are not sitting or anything 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.110
 drama that is to say the first hockey 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.210
 obviously those that are in the village and 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.639
 all very well and this is something that 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.470
 if you're going to go to the whore 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.360
 shit because this one wants to be free 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.669
 wants to leave all these parks 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.319
 really go live the free life not 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.880
 in fact it's pretty epic like sakura 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.009
 she is obviously in love with him and she 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.139
 wants to go with him to live adventures but 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.849
 jump says does that what he did and tatis 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.410
 I do not remember bad to own disgust is that of 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.330
 that puts the two of them in the plan 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.300
 If I do not give a fuck, we'll do it 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.970
 later 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.069
 it's late later later and nothing 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.930
 basically, really, those that 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.370
 leave the hidden village of the leaf this 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.080
 is something that we already expected because the 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.970
 movie of the car we saw you that those 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.470
 that reappeared on the sheet only 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.690
 to defend it while naruto 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.669
 was out so if he leaves the 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.440
 hidden village of the leaf and now you can 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.000
 say to and not perfect is the dream of 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.289
 naruto has not been fulfilled and yes it has 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.120
 done you know that it really has 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.590
 reconciled with a sakura in light of 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.270
 all these people and has really come back 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.009
 there was another thing is that then for the 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.599
 bipolarity or because he wants to live 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.610
 free adventures because this one has 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.289
 decided to leave to go to take for ass 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.909
 from the village hey but the dream said 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.889
 is fulfilled and to act the chapter 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.289
 we see something quite epic and it's like 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.180
 Naruto gives that torn ribbon that tape 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.979
 in plan of renegade takasu quique one 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.990
 that Naruto himself made that streak 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.520
 fighting against this at the end of the car 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.169
 normal gives it not as the memory and 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.940
 she just from the manga has really been 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.590
 a great manga what was said and nothing I believe 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.449
 I'm going to go saying goodbye, I do not want to 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.610
 make any kind of theory because I already 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.990
 came out the 700 manga and I really want 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.340
 to see it so I'm going to put it to edit 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.050
 this with a crazy fucking and as soon as 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.240
 I finished editing this video I will try 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.430
 bring the light reaction of the manga 700 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.020
 next to the subsequent review of this 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.190
 manga so nothing to the said 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.810
 because you liked this video if it's 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.889
 so he did not decentralize and tell me what has 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.240
 like this chapter and what has 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.680
 seemed like this review subscribe for not 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.479
 present no video try not to 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.620
 spoilear me the end because what was said 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.970
 I 've seen it and I'm going to see it 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.319
 the best I get this video is sunk 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.490
 you can not increase this video is 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.259
 uploaded I think I'll have seen 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.240
 thorn in prime mind some paradoxes 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.250
 I usually nothing that left me and rolled 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.430
 you are the person kids come to 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.430
