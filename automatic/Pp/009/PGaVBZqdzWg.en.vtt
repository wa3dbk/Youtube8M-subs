00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.530
 or Christmas night we are going to teach you 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.530
 to do 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:32.400
 the five hundred materials are 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:42.200
 and the cotton that each 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:44.760
 this kind of they are free scissors 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 and a rule that you can find in your 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.010
 house you have to choose three colors of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.200
 thread we chose this color 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.620
 purple and pink salmon 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.100
 then we take the thread and we have to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 measure each one looking to be 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 centimeters and cut it 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.990
 once we cut the threads of 60 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.490
 centimeters each what we're going to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.780
 to do is in the account that we open and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780
 we put the three threads 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 and the comfortable ones so that it is exactly 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.780
 in the middle 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 A) Yes 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.780
 and then we'll make a knot 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.800
 and we squeeze it 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.950
 once we already have it in fact what 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.930
 you have to put on the hard surface and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.930
 put the ibex on top of the account 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.990
 and it goes separating the colors has to 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.780
 have a color on each side or be a 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.140
 purple in one and in another pink rose 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.050
 annual salvanÃ©s now you have to put 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.530
 something like that here the red ones here 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.250
 and the sisters here and it's very easy to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.650
 is that to pass it is up 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.450
 in the middle but as it belongs to those of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 Goats and is the same 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.680
 and so you are doing 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.459
 Y 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.459
 you have to tighten them I'm perfect 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 once finished what we have to do 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.620
 is to make a knot 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.490
 now not half of miguel we have 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.490
 so that it does not fall apart 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.860
 finally the pressures are going to be 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.410
 something like that and if they want a bracelet more 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.380
 large use a wider thread as 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.750
 The one on the left 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.450
 and the ball is perfect so it does not 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.370
 you drop the bracelet well that's it 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.580
 for today and if to taste the video of the elai 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.020
 and subscribe to and every Sunday 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.180
 divided at night so that on Mondays 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.520
 can see them and if the time between 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.290
 we will also upload more videos 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.270
 and let's say that they would like it 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.890
 let's make our next video here 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.850
 they make good comments clean 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.440
