00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.359
 We are talking about an increase of about one meter or one and a half meters 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.899
 He also mentioned this 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.490
 President Felipe Calderón through his twitter account 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.920
 it is important to say that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.469
 this swell will arrive at different times throughout 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.750

 per hundred per feeder 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.040

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.779

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.299
 is pending the government of everything that can happen the marina of mexico 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:19.950
 as well 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.880
 issue this alarm 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.700
 He puts at your disposal 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.909
 there's the whole marina 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.930
 per cent for the other relief that may stop some ships 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.700
 in the vicinity of 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.910
 the Mexican territory in the marine maritime territory 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.020
 and this 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.480
 and also the Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it offers 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.239
 all support first place the condolences 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.340
 the Japanese people offer their full support 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 and he says that he is very aware of what is happening also with the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.000
 nationals there in japan as well as you have spoken this morning you have already been able 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.399
 talk also with the ambassador of Mexico back in japan carlos 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.279
 precisely this communication that we had that you were the contract 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.029
 our husband told us the ambassador 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.940
 who knows them likes you to be in the field 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.810
 apparently the information that he is getting from his interesting point 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.489
 that there are a number of people just as it happens with bulls countries 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.909
 that are registered by 13 people who are living Japan and are not 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.779
 registered and psoe have no knowledge 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.589
 but the information you have so far 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.999
 is that they are all a hundred that does not suffer any kind of mishap but 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.019
 it also seems important that there was an internet site to ccoo a page of 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.229
 facebook that could be 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.969
 percent and communicate to inform that what was is happening 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.509
 has mario preciously the situation is this news news that is 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.659
 Mind you we are talking about hundreds of dead could have left 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.160
 there is not an exact figure at this time we can not 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.320
 venture to give an exact figure how this news is being followed 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 so hot icia of this terrible earthquake that hit japan there in mexico 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
 how the media is handling it 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:52.239
 barton the local media are obviously focused age covering that this 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.489
 history is obviously different perspectives the news of the of the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.140
 tragedy that is living for the Japanese but also very worried 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.170
 of all the nationals who are there as well you mention not all the 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 who are registered 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.390
 percent to the Mexican consulate in japan are those who are in ayala and 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.490
 many students many tourists who have not mind them have registered 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.300
 the ambassador was spoken that they are around between one thousand 300 thousand 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.139
 Five hundred Mexican people living there have to 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.989
 They are duly registered 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.819
 but there are many others that have 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.009
 decided to take some vacations or are there by also per percent 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.700
 m step simply 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.340
 and what in the relatives are asking for information 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.350
 this page is open on facebook is very easy to reach them through 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.080
 By the way, it's simply looking on Facebook page of the embassy that 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.270
 is the official website of the embassy of mexico in japan and that through 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.000
 this page 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.970
 many people are taking communication 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.600
 with its headquarters relatives with their friends 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.680
 percent in the early hours carlos was the only way to 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.319
 stay more or less in communication 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.939
 the first communication you can have with the embassy was precisely for 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.080
 hundred india email 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.720
 I must say that we must say it acted 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.620
 cumulative fast Mexican advantage 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.590
 in Japan to tend to all the others even from the media 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.670
 is through the internet through 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.670
 of e-mail 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.849
 a little 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.020
 more easily 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.550
 let me tell you also Carlos eguillor that is is for us to realize 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.090
 the dimension of the interest that is charging this here in mexico and 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.189
 in Latin America 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.150
 the page 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.800
 of cnn mexico puntocom 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.110
 I started having certain problems of slowness 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.439
 because it was so much traffic 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.590

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:35.180

 what is obviously the cargo and zoque 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.520
 they were issued little 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.620
 slower the portal but nevertheless already 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.180

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.720
