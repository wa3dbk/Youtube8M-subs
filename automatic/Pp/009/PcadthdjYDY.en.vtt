00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.349
 Speak there, people who fight this one more 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.240
 video to the top on tv 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 we will continue the tests of this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 machines and 1550 set that you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.289
 asked a lot that the f-35 bought 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 it to see how it works almost 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.529
 commitment of our good toy 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 Today's 630 processor and video card 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.859
 gtx 550 has the configuration of ms 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.899
 you do not see in the description and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.840
 configuration of the video that we 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 start is rotated all in low for you 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.530
 see some species later we will go up 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 for you to see the difference 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.390
 ok then not strange that I started 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:53.100
 play the game today then the goal is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.660
 show the game and not and not there and not yours 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.600
 I play less game but I already played here 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:05.339
 average guy lyon keeps dying good 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.670
 back to the kind of a sniper grandson 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.860
 is already in the mouth of our base 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.330
 Come on, I'll try to show you one. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.130
 little but football is crazy 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.360
 There is no program to run away from here. 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 I do not even know where I'm going all here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450
 good 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.130
 daniel only with fps that staff 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.440
 Looks our way is in long 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.860
 I think it would be down above it gets more 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.860
 high 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.800
 my dear 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.630
 also gives 40 40 and 50 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:58.420
 Now let's see, I'm catching enough. 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.420
 Fire here with me 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.510
 48 50 51 good and for what he did and goal 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:24.430
 It's only 49. We'll go there tomorrow. 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:27.430
 changing the video made no difference 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.430
 resume 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:53.359
 it is jurupari the node of the same class being a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:55.129
 different place was at 44 said that the 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:06.440
 business is getting back on the lawn 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:08.680
 here made see in 40 45 is not falling 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.680
 very 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.799
 You must first know where I'm going. 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.799
 huh 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.959
 button taking controlled here 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.549
 the first party 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.620
 the staff did not think it was a 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.600
 game any better this game for a while but 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.230
 Your goal is to show the fps here with 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.990
 you 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.850
 the mother again falls to 35 or so 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.800
 So you can see that for now. 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.730
 I can play 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.750
 quiet 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.750
 now I'm going to play the radio 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.109
 the game already feels that also heavier 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.320
 but it 's that thing for what I realized 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.000
 that looking at the fps to stay 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.430
 comfortable 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.900
 the game has to rotate above 40 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:34.730
 forty-two out there I can not 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.210
 like but okay, what are you going to show? 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.190
 What do you want to try to show some more? 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.030
 Then you can see this screen of proof and 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.090
 also oscillated well, right? 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.760
 good not left you see the ultra pro 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:57.860
 as that will drop the fps 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:59.960
 Look how long it takes to load it was me. 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.350
 said they were going to work in full ie 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.350
 truth 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.229
 remembering that the configuration and you are going 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.229
 have registration're 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.259
 the fpso and it was 20 in 2011 that is 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.259
 to feel 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.490
 and then the mouse is already much more 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.389
 heavy 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.370
 my mother again and personally 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.919
 being sincere now in my opinion 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.020
 game to play at least the most people 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.490
 Forget it, I really believed, I can not 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.950
 spend too much of it 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.169
 But the game as super heavy graphics 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.840
 very different because I already 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.480
 I played before because I recommend it then it is 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.940
 with this computer or as agents 550 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.980
 ti not pass the video of the shop goes 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.900
 to defend a little bit of the whole 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.700
 You know the heart itself is the plaque. 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.430
 of video 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.820
 so I recommend playing in the video he 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.590
 it was in the bf 3 tests you asked 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.979
 tained agent did not really 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.380
 go ultra and I hope you have 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:30.100
 liked is a young man for whom there 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.870
 liked and follow our channel and any 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.220
 doubt only ask the church a great 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.220
 Hugs to you, thanks
