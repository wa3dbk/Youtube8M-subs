00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.339
 good morning everyone during this video will be shown how to combine two helmets 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.039
 that mount the billy tg2 integrated communication system 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.469
 to activate the pilot and passenger inter-contracting function we recall 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.450
 in fact the intercomp functions 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.869
 emu guaranteed suggested. then a maximum distance of 10 meters 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.259
 ideal to use - the passenger when using the bike 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.359
 let's start with the transfer of the pilot's helmet for 4 seconds 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.910
 we press multi-function argotone until we see the blue light flashing a 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.010
 this point on the passenger's helmet we proceed by pressing the button 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.700
 Multifunction 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.360
 can't make money but for 4 it's often about 6 seconds 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.319
 finally the light blue and red light flashes at this time 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.989
 the pilot is being paired to accept the combination of the rotate 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.679
 the multi-function model volume direction + 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:57.720
 up to see 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.130
 here, too, the two blue and red lights will flash 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.070
 devices are being sought and we have heard the confirmation tone that poker 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.870
 machine the land 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.870
 the combination occurred correctly between the two devices 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.360
 in this active moment the inter function is enough to crush on one of the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 two helmets multifunction button 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.790
 and a tone is heard 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940
 which to confirm 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.600
 that the call in terracotta 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.670
 it's over 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 we can give at this point 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.799
 any helmets follow when you want to start intercom 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.799
 steel seats new multi-function button 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.950
 expect a couple of seconds 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.570
 yes if you feel alone with you have heard you will hear the confirmation tone that 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.200
 the intercom callback started at this point 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.920
 we close the call of the Greek 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 cullami both cases can also be combined mobile 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 in fact now I love you 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.780
 how can a layer the pairing in the first video await the bluetooth on the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 our cell phone 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.349
 from the bluetooth settings we connect it 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.989
 some devices may terminate the connection 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.150
 automatically 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.189
 they feel confirmed in our case 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.739
 - infinite goes in this moment is ruined with the mobile phone 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.840
 what happens the Peking helmet the pilot helmet 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.850
 hostess what you thought of as a passenger 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.509
 I can stay 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.509
 the music 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.640
 let's start with the reproduction of a random song 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.800
 in this case the helmet is listening to the music 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.139
 there are things that the phone does not require 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.040
 Inter Rome violent on the reproduction of music in this case indeed 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:54.149
 we crush milk the intercom request that the music is interrupted yes 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.720
 they feel a confirmation by the company 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.439
 at this point when 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.260
 he was pressing us again on one of the two helmets 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 the multifunction button controls the locked 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.210
 and the music will resume playing on the pilot helmet 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.339
 how you feel 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.629
 still on the eastern Alps it does not come from the rightly to the call 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.250
 there's another cell phone now 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.009
 palacio we are 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.729
 the pilot helmet 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.729
 what will be held 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.819
 the pilot helmet refers to the Maya veronica 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.339
 hahaha 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.469
 I can't answer 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.259
 safely handle your call 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.259
 I hang up 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.490
 perfect style are other times the multifunction button 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.300
 now waiting 3 seconds for reporters to play music 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:50.939
 how you feel 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.080
 newfoundland mind. receive a terracotta call 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:03.739
 When confirming the intercom call, the two cases can continue talking and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.639
 so on 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.809
 closure of the intercosmo call 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.730
 remember that the music management in the bbc2 device 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.010
 must be done exclusively by mobile phone on the helmet you can check 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.849
 on the volume 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.409
 so let's close 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.420
 music playback 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.640
 in case of waiting, this is the call for the cabin with his 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.349
 cellular or the Italiancomma call could be 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.009
 very well he ruined another cell phone too 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.469
 let's proceed lacona 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.550
 switching off on TV 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.270
 once they are turned back on 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.580
 since devices have been sent back, they will automatically pair and thank you 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.380
 for the attention
