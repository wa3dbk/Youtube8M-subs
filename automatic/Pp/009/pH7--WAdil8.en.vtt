on<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.840> r-13<00:00:10.440> converter<00:00:10.920> which<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> really

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
on the r-13 converter which is a really

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.720 
on the r-13 converter which is a really
high-end<00:00:12.290> two-in-one<00:00:13.320> convert<00:00:13.860> or<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.400> is

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
high-end two-in-one convert or this is

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.580 
high-end two-in-one convert or this is
actually<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.330> little<00:00:15.780> bit<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.020> lower<00:00:16.260> end

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
actually a little bit of lower end

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.830 
actually a little bit of lower end
device<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.369> slightly<00:00:17.820> heavier<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.539> screen

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
device it's slightly heavier the screen

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.759 
device it's slightly heavier the screen
isn't<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.380> high-end<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.310> got<00:00:20.430> that

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
isn't so high-end it's got that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.290 
isn't so high-end it's got that
360-degree<00:00:22.769> rotating<00:00:23.369> hinge<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.970> will<00:00:24.150> fold

and<00:00:27.029> you'll<00:00:27.180> end<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> tablet<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.109> is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
and you'll end up with a tablet that is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050 
and you'll end up with a tablet that is
rather<00:00:28.590> heavy<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.310> getting<00:00:29.519> close<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> 2

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
rather heavy it's getting close to 2

kilograms<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.779> my<00:00:31.199> opinion<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> can

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
kilograms in my opinion from what I can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.299 
kilograms in my opinion from what I can
feel<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.989> quite<00:00:34.230> thick<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:34.829> it's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
feel of it and it's quite thick but it's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
feel of it and it's quite thick but it's
got<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> terabyte<00:00:36.600> drive<00:00:36.870> inside<00:00:37.350> we've<00:00:37.559> got

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
got a terabyte drive inside we've got

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
got a terabyte drive inside we've got
core<00:00:37.920> processor<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:40.370> 12<00:00:41.370> gigabytes<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.479 
RAM here 1 3 6 6 by 7 6 8 screen size I
think<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> mismatch<00:00:47.219> between

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
think a little bit of a mismatch between

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
think a little bit of a mismatch between
some<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> specs<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.660> terms<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> screen

some of the specs here terms of screen
and<00:00:50.660> performance<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.610> expect<00:00:53.610> there's<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and performance but I expect there's a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
and performance but I expect there's a
