00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
like that the you pol Raptor stuff seems

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.660 
like that the you pol Raptor stuff seems
to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.329> pretty<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.560> man<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.520> know

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to be pretty good but man I don't know

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.950 
to be pretty good but man I don't know
how<00:01:56.790> much<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.240> need<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.750> whole

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
how much I would need to do this whole

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.950 
how much I would need to do this whole
surface<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> would<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.930> I

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
surface but it would be a lot and so I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
surface but it would be a lot and so I
don't<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.409> probably<00:02:02.130> don't<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> do

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
don't want to probably don't want to do

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.350 
don't want to probably don't want to do
that<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:05.060> anyway<00:02:06.060> let<00:02:06.600> me<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.860> what<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that but anyway let me know what if you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.070 
that but anyway let me know what if you
have<00:02:09.479> any<00:02:09.629> recommendations<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.470> any

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
have any recommendations of any

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.400 
have any recommendations of any
inexpensive<00:02:13.240> bedliner<00:02:14.240> materials<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.200> are

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
inexpensive bedliner materials that are

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.860 
inexpensive bedliner materials that are
catalyzed<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.610> activated<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.780> I'm

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
catalyzed and activated that and I'm

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.290 
catalyzed and activated that and I'm
probably<00:02:18.020> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.320> roll<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.620> on<00:02:18.680> here<00:02:18.950> also

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
probably going to roll it on here also

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.790 
probably going to roll it on here also
but<00:02:20.300> anyway<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.900> see<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.200> got<00:02:21.380> my<00:02:21.440> work<00:02:21.590> cut<00:02:21.620> out

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
but anyway you see I got my work cut out

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.200 
but anyway you see I got my work cut out
for<00:02:22.040> me<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.250> using<00:02:22.490> some<00:02:23.060> 80<00:02:23.570> grit<00:02:23.690> eight<00:02:24.560> inch

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
for me I'm using some 80 grit eight inch

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.470 
for me I'm using some 80 grit eight inch
disk<00:02:26.210> here<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.990> gonna<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.320> over<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:28.480> really

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
disk here just gonna go over it really

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.450 
disk here just gonna go over it really
well<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.990> then<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.740> Peck<00:02:30.920> places<00:02:31.310> they're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
well and then the Peck places they're

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.250 
well and then the Peck places they're
gonna<00:02:31.550> do<00:02:31.760> base<00:02:32.000> coat<00:02:32.240> clear<00:02:32.450> coat<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:32.840> I'm

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.680 
gonna do base coat clear coat on I'm
just<00:02:33.440> gonna<00:02:33.560> hit<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.820> coat<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.030> epoxy<00:02:35.210> as

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
just gonna hit with one coat of epoxy as

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.570 
just gonna hit with one coat of epoxy as
a<00:02:35.720> sealer<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.320> then<00:02:36.650> go<00:02:36.890> right<00:02:37.070> over<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.430> with

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
a sealer and then go right over it with

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.700 
a sealer and then go right over it with
base<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.210> clear<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.660> don't<00:02:39.230> know<00:02:39.380> what<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.650> is

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
base and clear I don't know what this is

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.460 
base and clear I don't know what this is
on<00:02:40.100> here<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.340> think<00:02:40.490> it's<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.320> believe<00:02:42.320> it's

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
on here I think it's I believe it's

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.820 
on here I think it's I believe it's
enamel<00:02:42.920> single-stage<00:02:43.670> enamel<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.680> does

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
enamel single-stage enamel it is it does

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.230 
enamel single-stage enamel it is it does
have<00:02:46.010> primer<00:02:46.280> indras<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.760> didn't<00:02:47.000> think<00:02:47.090> it

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
have primer indras I didn't think it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.910 
have primer indras I didn't think it
would<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.870> actually<00:02:48.170> does<00:02:48.350> have<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> primer

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
would but it actually does have a primer

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.130 
would but it actually does have a primer
coat<00:02:49.040> which<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.490> good<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:53.900> really

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
coat which is good so but it's really

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.040 
coat which is good so but it's really
faded<00:02:55.010> out<00:02:55.130> bad<00:02:55.459> up<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> top<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.780> then<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
faded out bad up on the top and then the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.530 
faded out bad up on the top and then the
sides<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.860> know<00:02:57.980> still<00:02:58.400> look<00:02:59.240> okay<00:02:59.510> on

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
sides of it you know still look okay on

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.570 
sides of it you know still look okay on
the<00:02:59.750> sides<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:01.100> was<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.430> thinking

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
the sides so I was kind of thinking

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.340 
the sides so I was kind of thinking
probably<00:03:01.940> probably<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.690> Namak<00:03:02.990> but<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.170> don't

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
probably probably to Namak but I don't

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.790 
probably probably to Namak but I don't
know<00:03:03.410> for<00:03:03.530> sure<00:03:03.670> anyway<00:03:04.670> yeah<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:06.500> know<00:03:06.590> just

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
know for sure anyway yeah you know just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.230 
know for sure anyway yeah you know just
in<00:03:06.980> general<00:03:07.040> let<00:03:07.520> me<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.730> if<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.060> any

in general let me know if you have any

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.310 
in general let me know if you have any
tips<00:03:08.390> or<00:03:08.780> ideas<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.459> bedliner<00:03:10.760> stuff

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
tips or ideas for the bedliner stuff

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.790 
tips or ideas for the bedliner stuff
also<00:03:12.320> just<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.100> general<00:03:13.130> any<00:03:13.790> ideas<00:03:14.360> for<00:03:14.800> for

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
also just in general any ideas for for

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.560 
also just in general any ideas for for
the<00:03:15.860> project<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.850> we'll<00:03:17.090> make<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.269> couple<00:03:17.480> of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
the project so we'll make a couple of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.950 
the project so we'll make a couple of
videos<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.380> show<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> what<00:03:18.739> we<00:03:18.830> do
