00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.000 

second<00:02:43.519> thing<00:02:43.760> would<00:02:44.390> be<00:02:44.630> i<00:02:44.900> don't<00:02:45.680> really

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
second thing would be i don't really

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.300 
second thing would be i don't really
like<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.550> opening<00:02:47.330> like<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:48.160> autumn<00:02:49.160> must

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
like it opening like this autumn must

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.080 
like it opening like this autumn must
prefer<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.910> split<00:02:50.209> up<00:02:50.450> or<00:02:50.720> flip<00:02:51.050> down<00:02:51.260> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
prefer to split up or flip down the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.940 
prefer to split up or flip down the
reason<00:02:53.090> why<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.630> when<00:02:53.930> you're<00:02:54.530> holding<00:02:54.860> your

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
reason why is when you're holding your

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.070 
reason why is when you're holding your
phone<00:02:55.220> while<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.820> it's<00:02:56.180> very<00:02:56.450> uncomfortable

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
phone while this it's very uncomfortable

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.780 
phone while this it's very uncomfortable
because<00:02:58.040> i<00:02:58.370> tend<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.790> put<00:02:58.970> my<00:02:59.350> a<00:03:00.400> small<00:03:01.400> finger

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
because i tend to put my a small finger

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.660 
because i tend to put my a small finger
at<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> bottom<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:03.049> here<00:03:03.560> somewhere<00:03:04.010> when

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
at the bottom that here somewhere when

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.960 
at the bottom that here somewhere when
i'm<00:03:04.820> holding<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.330> phone<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:07.459> know<00:03:07.640> morning

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
i'm holding the phone you know morning

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.750 
i'm holding the phone you know morning
you<00:03:08.060> scroll<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.540> screen<00:03:08.840> or<00:03:09.760> inputting

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
you scroll on the screen or inputting

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.490 
you scroll on the screen or inputting
text<00:03:10.790> for<00:03:11.390> example<00:03:11.480> if<00:03:11.959> you're<00:03:12.140> doing<00:03:12.350> with

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
text for example if you're doing with

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.880 
text for example if you're doing with
two<00:03:12.650> hands<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:14.090> awkward<00:03:14.739> unless<00:03:15.739> you

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
two hands it's very awkward unless you

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.910 
two hands it's very awkward unless you
do<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.790> landscape<00:03:17.920> otherwise

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
do it like that in landscape otherwise

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.300 
do it like that in landscape otherwise
yeah<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.370> pretty<00:03:19.519> awkward<00:03:19.730> odda<00:03:20.090> and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
yeah it's pretty awkward odda and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.009 
yeah it's pretty awkward odda and
obviously<00:03:22.310> by<00:03:22.519> when<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.360> grip<00:03:23.540> in<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.690> phone

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
obviously by when you grip in the phone

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.470 
obviously by when you grip in the phone
is<00:03:24.260> very<00:03:24.560> awkward<00:03:24.709> unless<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:26.090> flip<00:03:26.360> it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
is very awkward unless you flip it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.870 
is very awkward unless you flip it
backwards<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.890> even<00:03:28.010> then<00:03:28.250> it's<00:03:28.430> awkward

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
backwards but even then it's awkward

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.000 
backwards but even then it's awkward
because<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:29.959> moves<00:03:30.230> are<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.560> at<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.769> back

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
because this moves are in at the back

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.460 
because this moves are in at the back
and<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.459> just<00:03:31.760> doesn't<00:03:32.570> seem<00:03:32.690> like<00:03:32.750> if<00:03:33.110> you're

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
and it just doesn't seem like if you're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.880 
and it just doesn't seem like if you're
holding<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.860> phone<00:03:34.040> very<00:03:34.400> securely<00:03:35.050> so<00:03:36.050> yeah

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
holding the phone very securely so yeah

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.650 
holding the phone very securely so yeah
the<00:03:37.040> two<00:03:37.880> real<00:03:38.210> negatives<00:03:40.270> otherwise<00:03:41.270> it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
the two real negatives otherwise it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.470 
the two real negatives otherwise it
looks<00:03:41.720> really<00:03:42.500> classy<00:03:43.090> does<00:03:44.090> look<00:03:44.300> really

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
looks really classy does look really

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.740 
looks really classy does look really
nice<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:45.080> your<00:03:45.319> phone<00:03:45.760> that's<00:03:46.760> another<00:03:47.510> good

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
nice on your phone that's another good

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.770 
nice on your phone that's another good
thing<00:03:47.780> that's<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.290> good<00:03:48.470> thing<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:50.630> back

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
thing that's a good thing and the back

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.600 
thing that's a good thing and the back
cover<00:03:51.020> looks<00:03:51.500> like<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.830> original<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:52.490> a

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
cover looks like the original just a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.320 
cover looks like the original just a
little<00:03:52.940> bit<00:03:53.030> thicker<00:03:54.520> which<00:03:55.520> would<00:03:56.150> have<00:03:56.240> been

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
little bit thicker which would have been

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.210 
little bit thicker which would have been
awesome<00:03:56.630> if<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.110> was<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.950> thickness

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
awesome if this was that thickness

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.000 
awesome if this was that thickness
because<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.850> feels<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.870> lot<00:04:00.020> more<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> sound

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
because it feels a lot more so a sound

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.699 
because it feels a lot more so a sound
solid<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.580> feel<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.030> little<00:04:02.410> but<00:04:03.410> otherwise

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
solid and feel so little but otherwise

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.290 
solid and feel so little but otherwise
this<00:04:04.640> cost<00:04:04.940> me<00:04:05.060> thirty-five<00:04:05.510> dollars<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:08.090> it's

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
this cost me thirty-five dollars so it's

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.990 
this cost me thirty-five dollars so it's
not<00:04:08.390> too<00:04:08.569> bad<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.620> know<00:04:09.770> because<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.790> can<00:04:10.910> get

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
not too bad you know because you can get

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.690
