go let's go with this and then when you
put<00:04:23.699> your<00:04:23.729> screen<00:04:24.120> protector<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:26.280> want<00:04:26.490> to

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
put your screen protector on you want to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.689 
put your screen protector on you want to
lay<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.220> see<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
lay it on like this you can see the

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.230 
lay it on like this you can see the
small<00:04:30.260> hole<00:04:31.260> there<00:04:31.889> should<00:04:32.669> be<00:04:32.760> on<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.030> left

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
small hole there should be on the left

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.340 
small hole there should be on the left
side<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.889> this<00:04:35.130> small<00:04:36.090> hole<00:04:36.389> that's<00:04:37.110> for<00:04:37.289> your

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
proximity sensor when you pick the phone

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.850 
proximity sensor when you pick the phone
up<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.330> your<00:04:39.449> cheek<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.110> turns<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.470> keypad

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
off you want that to be visible so it'll

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.210 
off you want that to be visible so it'll
work<00:04:44.400> correctly<00:04:45.289> so<00:04:46.880> let's<00:04:47.880> see<00:04:48.800> I'm<00:04:49.800> go<00:04:50.009> ahead

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
work correctly so let's see I'm go ahead

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.159 
work correctly so let's see I'm go ahead
and<00:04:50.460> peel<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.449> back<00:04:51.690> off<00:04:54.440> line<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.590> up<00:04:56.960> pop<00:04:57.960> it
