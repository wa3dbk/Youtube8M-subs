black spot and hope that the energy in

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.240 
black spot and hope that the energy in
the<00:00:21.660> plant<00:00:21.900> comes<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:22.650> tissue<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the plant comes out of good tissue and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.570 
the plant comes out of good tissue and

good stems and not get sorted by bad

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.429 
good stems and not get sorted by bad
stems<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.449> never<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> grow<00:00:28.080> again

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
stems that are never going to grow again

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.749 
stems that are never going to grow again
so<00:00:28.740> let<00:00:28.890> me<00:00:28.980> show<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:31.759> are

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
so let me show you what we have here are

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340 
so let me show you what we have here are
two<00:00:32.790> stems<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.390> look<00:00:33.630> pretty<00:00:33.840> good<00:00:34.020> got<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
two stems that look pretty good got a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
two stems that look pretty good got a
lot<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> foliage<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
lot of foliage on but right in the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.470 
lot of foliage on but right in the
center<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.820> black

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
center there it's black

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.540 
center there it's black
it'll<00:00:39.809> never<00:00:40.020> grow<00:00:40.260> again<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.129> does<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it'll never grow again all it does is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
it'll never grow again all it does is
get<00:00:41.700> black<00:00:41.969> spot<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.360> cause<00:00:42.930> problems<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
get black spot and cause problems this

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.970 
get black spot and cause problems this
other<00:00:44.250> stems<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.760> same<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.800> get

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
other stems the same way and so we get

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.459 
other stems the same way and so we get
rid<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.239> call<00:00:48.539> trash<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.230> dead<00:00:49.440> end

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
rid of what we call trash or dead end

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.130 
rid of what we call trash or dead end
stems<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.579> plants<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> usually

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
stems all plants have them and usually

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.080 
stems all plants have them and usually
they're<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> bottom<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> plant<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
they're at the bottom of the plant the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
they're at the bottom of the plant the
plant<00:00:54.120> starts<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.260> many<00:00:55.620> stems<00:00:56.039> but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
plant starts out with many stems but

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.670 
plant starts out with many stems but
only<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> few<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.629> end<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> having

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
only a few of them end up in having

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
only a few of them end up in having
blooms<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:00.750> have

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
blooms on them and so if they don't have

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.709 
blooms on them and so if they don't have
blooms<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.180> only<00:01:03.210> reason<00:01:03.600> you'd

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
blooms on them the only reason you'd

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
blooms on them the only reason you'd
leave<00:01:03.899> them<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> Sun<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
leave them on there is for the Sun to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
leave them on there is for the Sun to
hit<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> leaves<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> give<00:01:06.720> energy<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
hit the leaves and to give energy to the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
hit the leaves and to give energy to the
plant<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.549> stems<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.570> have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
plant if that's the only stems you have

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
plant if that's the only stems you have
then<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> leave<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
then you would want to leave them on so

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.420 
then you would want to leave them on so
that<00:01:12.119> you'd<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.080> energy<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> plant<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that you'd get energy into the plant but

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
that you'd get energy into the plant but
if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.790> other<00:01:15.000> foliage<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
if you got other foliage you want to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
if you got other foliage you want to
take<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.180> have

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
take them off and you can see they have

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
take them off and you can see they have
been<00:01:18.509> removed<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.290> plant<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.210 
and adhere to it and really wet weather
like<00:01:45.270> we're<00:01:45.479> having<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.100> when<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
like we're having right now when you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.670 
like we're having right now when you
make<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> cut<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.390> stem<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.470> leaves

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
make a cut on a stem and it leaves

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
make a cut on a stem and it leaves
something<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.369> looks<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.420> there<00:01:51.960> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
something that looks like this there is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.770 
something that looks like this there is
a<00:01:52.170> insect<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.250> flies<00:01:53.549> overhead<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.390> he<00:01:54.479> sees

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
a insect that flies overhead and he sees

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
a insect that flies overhead and he sees
this<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.290> he<00:01:55.350> he's<00:01:55.829> called<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> bore<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.520> he

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
this and he he's called a bore and he

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.850 
this and he he's called a bore and he
lays<00:01:57.180> an<00:01:57.390> egg<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.170> destroys<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
lays an egg in there and it destroys the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.690 
lays an egg in there and it destroys the
stem<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:00.619> some<00:02:01.619> dirt<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.250> some

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
stem but if you take some dirt or some

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.139 
stem but if you take some dirt or some
potting<00:02:03.119> mix<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.990> rub<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
potting mix and you rub it on there it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
potting mix and you rub it on there it
darkens<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.340> he's<00:02:08.340> smart<00:02:08.640> enough<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> know

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
darkens it and he's smart enough to know

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.979 
darkens it and he's smart enough to know
that<00:02:09.690> there's<00:02:10.319> no<00:02:11.030> moisture<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.450> dead<00:02:12.660> stem

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
that there's no moisture in a dead stem

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.440 
that there's no moisture in a dead stem
so<00:02:13.260> he

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
so he

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.510 
so he
won't<00:02:13.599> stop<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.140> lay<00:02:14.260> an<00:02:14.379> egg<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.860> fool<00:02:15.280> him

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
won't stop to lay an egg so you fool him

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.180 
won't stop to lay an egg so you fool him
by<00:02:16.060> doing<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.900> want<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.319> prune<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:17.920> that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
by doing that we want to prune so that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.940 
by doing that we want to prune so that
we<00:02:18.730> don't<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:19.150> stubs<00:02:19.629> so<00:02:20.500> there's<00:02:20.739> nothing

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
we don't have stubs so there's nothing

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.880 
we don't have stubs so there's nothing
sticking<00:02:21.400> up<00:02:21.670> or<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.030> will<00:02:22.209> die<00:02:22.420> back<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.200> so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
sticking up or it will die back and so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.210 
sticking up or it will die back and so
to<00:02:24.519> cut<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:26.080> particular<00:02:26.739> length<00:02:27.010> is

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
to cut to this particular length is

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.430 
to cut to this particular length is
desired<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.239> distance<00:02:28.660> from<00:02:28.989> an

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
desired this is the distance from an

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.759 
desired this is the distance from an
emerging<00:02:30.370> stem<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.630> larger<00:02:32.170> stem<00:02:32.440> should

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
emerging stem that a larger stem should

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.089 
emerging stem that a larger stem should
could<00:02:32.950> be<00:02:33.099> cut<00:02:33.310> here<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.120> another<00:02:35.099> dead-end

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
could be cut here is another dead-end

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.880 
could be cut here is another dead-end
stem<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.360> short<00:02:37.599> distance<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.709> can

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
stem just a short distance and you can

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.270 
stem just a short distance and you can
see<00:02:39.099> on<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.430> end<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.040> there

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
see on the end of it that right in there

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.070 
see on the end of it that right in there
that<00:02:42.549> it's<00:02:42.910> dead<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> ever

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
that it's dead it's not going to ever

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.789 
that it's dead it's not going to ever
grow<00:02:44.349> again<00:02:44.379> it's<00:02:44.950> trash<00:02:45.400> should<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.849> removed

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
grow again it's trash should be removed

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.229 
grow again it's trash should be removed
I'm<00:02:47.799> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.069> take<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.400> one<00:02:48.610> down<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.060> show

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
I'm going to take this one down and show

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.039 
I'm going to take this one down and show
you<00:02:49.269> another<00:02:49.599> one<00:02:51.329> here's<00:02:52.329> a<00:02:52.390> plant<00:02:52.750> where

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
you another one here's a plant where

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.620 
you another one here's a plant where
most<00:02:53.349> of<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.790> foliage<00:02:54.790> has<00:02:54.940> been<00:02:55.150> taken<00:02:55.510> off

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
most of the foliage has been taken off

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.400 
most of the foliage has been taken off
but<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> stems<00:02:56.890> haven't<00:02:57.310> been<00:02:57.519> cut<00:02:58.090> snug<00:02:58.480> so

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
but the stems haven't been cut snug so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.949 
but the stems haven't been cut snug so
consequently<00:03:00.099> you<00:03:00.700> would<00:03:00.880> want<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.269> cut<00:03:01.480> all

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
consequently you would want to cut all

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.050 
consequently you would want to cut all
of<00:03:02.019> these<00:03:02.440> stems<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:03.069> have<00:03:03.160> died<00:03:03.370> off<00:03:03.700> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
of these stems that have died off and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.050 
of these stems that have died off and
you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:05.250> sometimes<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:06.519> really<00:03:06.849> easy

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
you can sometimes it's not really easy

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.600 
you can sometimes it's not really easy
but<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.660> see<00:03:07.870> how<00:03:08.049> it's<00:03:08.290> dead<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:09.459> at

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
but you can see how it's dead just at

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.520 
but you can see how it's dead just at
the<00:03:09.730> bottom<00:03:09.940> why<00:03:10.360> there's<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.989> little<00:03:11.290> green

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
the bottom why there's a little green

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.380 
the bottom why there's a little green
and<00:03:11.799> those<00:03:11.890> still<00:03:12.160> should<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.549> removed<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.150> get

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
and those still should be removed to get

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.630 
and those still should be removed to get
below<00:03:13.690> where<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.650> die<00:03:14.799> back<00:03:15.099> is<00:03:15.340> that's

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
below where the die back is that's

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.400 
below where the die back is that's
called<00:03:15.880> die<00:03:16.090> back<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.569> black<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.200> stem

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
called die back that black on the stem

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.890 
called die back that black on the stem
and<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.709> dies<00:03:17.889> down<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.459> stem<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.030> will<00:03:19.660> kill

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
and it dies down the stem and will kill

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.750 
and it dies down the stem and will kill
the<00:03:20.109> stem<00:03:20.350> all<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.739> way<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.160> bottom<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.639> it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
the stem all the way to the bottom if it

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.789 
the stem all the way to the bottom if it
hasn't<00:03:21.940> already<00:03:22.209> done<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.900> there's<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.560> stem

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
hasn't already done so there's a stem

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.099 
hasn't already done so there's a stem
with<00:03:24.010> die<00:03:24.190> back<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> big<00:03:26.079> a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
with die back and so this is a big a

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.129 
with die back and so this is a big a
heavier<00:03:26.500> stem<00:03:27.000> put<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.180> dull<00:03:28.660> edge<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:29.079> the

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
heavier stem put the dull edge of the

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.160 
heavier stem put the dull edge of the
blade<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.579> crotch<00:03:30.850> where<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.720> stem<00:03:31.989> is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
blade in the crotch where the stem is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.890 
blade in the crotch where the stem is
emerging<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:32.980> I've<00:03:33.850> cut<00:03:34.090> up<00:03:34.120> with<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.600> sharp

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
emerging and I've cut up with the sharp

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.220 
emerging and I've cut up with the sharp
blade

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
blade

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.190 
blade
I've<00:03:35.709> cut<00:03:36.040> beneath<00:03:36.400> where<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:37.170> where<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
I've cut beneath where the where the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.360 
I've cut beneath where the where the
black<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.540> Centers<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.290> stem<00:03:42.160> is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
black is and the Centers of the stem is

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.370 
black is and the Centers of the stem is
cream-colored<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.930> means<00:03:44.139> it's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
cream-colored and that means it's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.259 
cream-colored and that means it's
healthy<00:03:44.769> now<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.459> we've<00:03:45.639> done<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.000> the

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
healthy now that we've done that the

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.780 
healthy now that we've done that the
next<00:03:46.299> thing<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.380> seal<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.579> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
next thing is to seal it so that the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.000 
next thing is to seal it so that the
insects<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.810> flies<00:03:50.019> overhead<00:03:50.410> won't<00:03:50.769> lay<00:03:50.980> a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
insects that flies overhead won't lay a

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.129 
insects that flies overhead won't lay a
egg<00:03:51.579> in<00:03:51.819> there<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.150> develops<00:03:52.510> into<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.870> bore

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
egg in there and develops into a bore

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.220 
egg in there and develops into a bore
and<00:03:53.380> kills<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.889> stem<00:03:54.130> again<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.930> keeps

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
and kills the stem again this keeps

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.470 
and kills the stem again this keeps
borsch<00:03:56.560> from<00:03:56.799> getting<00:03:57.069> into<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.609> your<00:03:58.120> stem

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
borsch from getting into your your stem

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.900 
borsch from getting into your your stem
so<00:03:58.840> yeah<00:03:59.079> if<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.440> can<00:03:59.650> see<00:03:59.859> it<00:03:59.980> cover<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.760> if

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
so yeah if you can see it cover it if

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.190 
so yeah if you can see it cover it if
you<00:04:01.000> can't<00:04:01.209> see<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.420> they<00:04:01.660> can't<00:04:01.900> see<00:04:02.109> it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
you can't see it they can't see it

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.960 
you can't see it they can't see it
there's<00:04:02.980> another<00:04:03.130> stem<00:04:04.290> looks<00:04:05.290> good<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.849> it's

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
there's another stem looks good but it's

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.890 
there's another stem looks good but it's
never<00:04:07.150> going<00:04:07.329> to<00:04:07.389> grow<00:04:08.700> because<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.150> stopped

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
never going to grow because it stopped

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.479 
never going to grow because it stopped
growing<00:04:11.139> and<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.650> can't<00:04:11.889> make<00:04:12.069> it<00:04:12.130> grow<00:04:12.459> again

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
growing and you can't make it grow again

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.990 
growing and you can't make it grow again
at<00:04:13.269> least<00:04:13.419> I<00:04:13.630> can't<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.459> remove<00:04:15.849> it

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
at least I can't so you remove it

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.789 
at least I can't so you remove it
because<00:04:16.599> anything<00:04:16.900> that's<00:04:17.109> not<00:04:17.470> going<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.709> be

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
because anything that's not going to be

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.039 
because anything that's not going to be
productive<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:19.180> don't<00:04:19.359> need<00:04:19.539> on<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.810> plant

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
productive we don't need on the plant

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.770 
productive we don't need on the plant
and<00:04:20.829> here<00:04:21.160> again<00:04:21.280> we<00:04:21.579> got<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> stem<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.539> needs

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
and here again we got a stem that needs

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.690 
and here again we got a stem that needs
to<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.050> cut<00:04:23.229> back<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.830> put<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.190> dead<00:04:24.400> end

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
to be cut back so you put the dead end

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.060 
to be cut back so you put the dead end
the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.680 
the
sharp<00:04:28.070> into<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.610> Clippers<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.270> outside

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
sharp into the Clippers on the outside

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.630 
sharp into the Clippers on the outside
and<00:04:29.900> cut<00:04:30.110> up<00:04:30.230> towards<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.830> crotch<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
and cut up towards the crotch of the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.850 
and cut up towards the crotch of the
stem<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:35.600> then<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.200> seal<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:38.680> these<00:04:39.680> were

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
stem and then you seal it these were

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.300 
stem and then you seal it these were
bare<00:04:40.070> root<00:04:40.280> plants<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.030> nursery<00:04:42.310> potted

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
bare root plants that the nursery potted

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.420 
bare root plants that the nursery potted
in<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.520> three<00:04:43.730> gallon<00:04:43.910> pot<00:04:44.360> with<00:04:44.630> potting<00:04:45.020> mix

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
in a three gallon pot with potting mix

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.040 
in a three gallon pot with potting mix
they<00:04:46.430> will<00:04:46.610> grow<00:04:46.790> better<00:04:47.000> in<00:04:47.150> potting<00:04:47.870> mix

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
they will grow better in potting mix

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.040 
they will grow better in potting mix
than<00:04:48.260> they<00:04:48.380> will<00:04:48.560> in<00:04:48.890> most<00:04:49.520> soils<00:04:50.050> because

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
than they will in most soils because

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
than they will in most soils because
there<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:51.980> more<00:04:52.310> air<00:04:53.120> or<00:04:53.480> oxygen<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.530> potting

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
there is more air or oxygen and potting

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.690 
there is more air or oxygen and potting
mix<00:04:55.250> than<00:04:55.490> there<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:55.670> in<00:04:56.440> soils<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.700> so

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
mix than there is in soils and so

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.140 
mix than there is in soils and so
therefore<00:04:58.970> we<00:04:59.510> grow<00:04:59.750> our<00:04:59.930> roses<00:05:00.590> in<00:05:01.150> holes

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
therefore we grow our roses in holes

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.870 
therefore we grow our roses in holes
where<00:05:02.510> we<00:05:02.690> have<00:05:02.900> put<00:05:03.050> potting<00:05:03.440> mix<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.640> 10

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
where we have put potting mix just a 10

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.360 
where we have put potting mix just a 10
inch<00:05:05.120> hole<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:06.440> roots<00:05:06.680> reach<00:05:06.950> you<00:05:07.160> have

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
inch hole the roots reach you have

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.790 
inch hole the roots reach you have
hundreds<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.090> little<00:05:08.330> short<00:05:09.080> roots<00:05:09.380> about<00:05:09.590> two

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
hundreds of little short roots about two

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.030 
hundreds of little short roots about two
inches<00:05:10.130> long<00:05:10.190> after<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:10.970> first<00:05:11.180> year<00:05:11.480> and<00:05:12.040> all

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
inches long after the first year and all

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.740 
inches long after the first year and all
of<00:05:13.250> these<00:05:13.370> are<00:05:13.430> feeder<00:05:13.820> roots<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.330> take<00:05:14.510> in

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
of these are feeder roots and take in

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.500 
of these are feeder roots and take in
whatever<00:05:15.110> nutrition<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.180> things<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.390> you

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
whatever nutrition and things that you

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.960 
whatever nutrition and things that you
put<00:05:17.720> on<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.380> hole<00:05:18.620> where<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.190> had<00:05:19.400> put<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
put on the hole where you had put the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.420 
put on the hole where you had put the
rose<00:05:20.380> quite<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.410> bit<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.800> difference<00:05:22.250> between

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
rose quite a bit the difference between

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.050 
rose quite a bit the difference between
putting<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.090> in<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.360> ground<00:05:23.570> where<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:25.060> roots

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
putting it in the ground where the roots

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.670 
putting it in the ground where the roots
will<00:05:26.210> reach<00:05:26.360> out<00:05:26.570> two<00:05:26.780> or<00:05:26.900> three<00:05:27.110> feet<00:05:27.350> but

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
will reach out two or three feet but

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.730 
will reach out two or three feet but
you'll<00:05:27.860> have<00:05:28.330> only<00:05:29.330> maybe<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.110> dozen<00:05:30.590> or<00:05:30.710> so

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
you'll have only maybe a dozen or so

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.760 
you'll have only maybe a dozen or so
roots<00:05:31.730> instead<00:05:32.540> of<00:05:32.690> hundreds<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.410> feet<00:05:33.620> our

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
roots instead of hundreds of feet our

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.740 
roots instead of hundreds of feet our
roots<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.160> have<00:05:34.340> just<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.670> few<00:05:34.700> large<00:05:35.180> roots<00:05:35.540> in

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
roots you have just a few large roots in

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.110 
roots you have just a few large roots in
