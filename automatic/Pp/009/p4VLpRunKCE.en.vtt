00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hi all subscribers and viewers channel 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.839
 today i would like to talk to you about 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 hasbro figure 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.210
 from the marvel legends series infinite this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.650
 character figure named carnage 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 for the first time this symbiote appeared in the series 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.640
 comics from the publisher marvel line 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.859
 for the rally spiderman in 300 sixty 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.850
 first release 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.119
 the main carrier of this symbiosis 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.010
 is the serial killer cassus cassidy 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.439
 two were responsible for creating this character 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.179
 man this david did not get in the way and eric 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 larsen 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.930
 To this day, this character appears in 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.590
 marvel universe and is the worst 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 the enemy of Venom symbiote and spider-man 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.790
 I think to demonstrate the packaging figures 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.860
 not necessary since in the previous review on 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.370
 action figure from this series namely on super 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.550
 as I have already shown it so that once 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 move on to the figurine and cue accessory 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 Perhaps we will start with the details of the green goblin 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.030
 with their ultimate universe with a figurine going 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.270
 only 2 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.730
 the first is the head of the green goblin 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.540
 look at her sculpture he made 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:14.159
 very detailed and neatly visible all 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:19.100
 fine details well worked out features 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:24.619
 faces neatly on clara painted teeth 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.450
 eyes paint does not go beyond the eyelids 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.530
 and of course these fangs 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.530
 go along the jaw 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.200
 below there is a hole for the hinge this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.920
 was the first part the second part is this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.579
 such is the nozzle on his back in the form 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.280
 flames are made of transparent 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.280
 plastic looks pretty cool 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.950
 as for the accessory which 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.329
 adjacent to the figure itself we 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.740
 move on to the review 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.049
 and now let's look at 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:10.000
 figuring out the details start as always with 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:14.660
 head carnage sculpted perfectly 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.709
 it immediately recognizes this character 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.060
 can be seen in his mouth 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.120
 and of course there’s a lot of eyes 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.360
 the role played and painting which by the way 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:36.049
 pretty mean not to say that 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.450
 bad but not smart below us 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.849
 no special details 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.099
 the figure is completely painted in red 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.019
 the color itself 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.780
 eye-catching detail this here these 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.500
 black conductors that go with him around 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.319
 body which by the way is also very good 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.980
 no blots are painted on them i'm not 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.980
 noticed 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.830
 also very well executed his hands with 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.980
 claws his left hand in slightly 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.980
 open position right slightly compressed 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.060
 as you had time to notice on the figure 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.490
 there are plenty of such here 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.240
 symbiotic processes namely on 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.890
 hands on the back and on the legs they are made 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:36.150
 soft rubber can bend them and 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.380
 poterebit but on the back it's just 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.200
 there is the same accessory which 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.400
 adjacent to this figurine 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.850
 large process can be removed if desired 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.850
 so here it looks 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.660
 you can display a figure, and without it but I 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.150
 display figure along with it since on 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.150
 my opinion it looks so organic 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.430
 as for the articulation, there’s exactly such 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.430
 the same situation as with the super spiders figure 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.530
 she is absolutely playable her much you can 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.079
 put in any pose crazy which 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.459
 it will come to you in general with her all 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.039
 ok in the end I will say that this figure 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.169
 carnage came out more than well and and on 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.030
 my opinion is the best figure of it 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.389
 character that you can purchase 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.780
 Today I think on this 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.340
 finish this video all thanks for
