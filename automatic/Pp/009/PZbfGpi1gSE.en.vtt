chord so you're applying pressure to the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.630 
chord so you're applying pressure to the
back<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.420> neck<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.840> pressing<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.399> that

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.559 
you are getting more than that you know
your<00:02:00.100> thumb<00:02:00.369> shouldn't<00:02:00.759> be<00:02:00.850> here<00:02:01.149> should<00:02:01.479> it

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
your thumb shouldn't be here should it

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.710 
your thumb shouldn't be here should it
be<00:02:01.780> up<00:02:02.050> here<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.860> should<00:02:03.009> be<00:02:03.130> here

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
be up here it should be here

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.930 
be up here it should be here
so<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.380> something<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.190> push<00:02:06.490> on<00:02:06.729> to
