 to make a couple of together 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.900
 earrings I called flowers web 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 it is not a tongue twister but a name that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.720
 derives from two words flowers point flowers 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.700
 and web how to get married then marriage 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 waiting then you will understand immediately as soon as there is 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.410
 I will show you the reason for this name 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.100
 then I 'll show you so here they are 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 here then flowers precisely because 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.980
 we will use these pins really 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.370
 very beautiful in formats from three i 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.410
 flowers each and web just because 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.950
 the colors that I decided to 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.430
 use in my opinion are perfect for 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.559
 a bride or a bridesmaid and also 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.690
 the very features of the earring that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.460
 however not exaggerated but very fine e 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.909
 delicate 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.829
 in my opinion it is very suitable to be is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.229
 a very suitable creation 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:17.520
 earring for a ceremony e 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.500
 you will see that it is very simple to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 realize therefore suitable for 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 both beginners and people who 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 however they are already more experienced in the field 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.010
 and in any case the effect is the effect 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 judge you then you will let me know me 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.050
 it seems less pleasant 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.150
 well I leave you with the tutorial having of 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.700
 leave a comment below this video 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.500
 to let me know what you think there 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.770
 I leave tutorial insert on the wire the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 pearl and 7 fortress on 11 0 we return to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.350
 reverse direction in the pearl then from 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.310
 behind and it comes to create this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.300
 bow we re- enter with the thread in all 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.300
 these beads 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:23.230
 in all seven we find the two again 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.629
 close strands of wire 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.019
 let's make a couple of knots we cut 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.870
 the surplus and we go out again from the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.620
 penalty I go down from the first I was kyle 11 0 of 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.439
 This orc take black and kyle 80 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.129
 jumping a bead we enter the 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:45.239
 third another fortress on 80 we skip one 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.189
 sedan and we enter the next one 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.909
 still a fortress on 80 and we enter 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:56.530
 in the last bellina of the bow 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:03:01.359
 we are back in the pearl and we are ready 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.959
 for a new ride entering and leaving 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:07.900
 therefore from the first fortress the 80 entered 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.659
 in this we feel on the thread 2 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:18.810
 rocaille 11 0 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:18.810
 the drop a rock on 11 0 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:31.120
 let's return to the drop then from below 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:34.689
 on the 32 rocca the 11 0 and we enter the 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.099
 rocaille lot zero after that 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.159
 from which we are leaving 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.579
 if it will come to form this we repeat the 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.639
 passage then entering the remainder 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.099
 then in the third fortress 80 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:53.889
 beautiful I go down from these rocaille 80 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:57.609
 we also enter the next xi 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:00.959
 we enter the pearl we insert 7 fortress 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.959
 on 11th 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:10.989
 here they are back in the pearl we will have 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:14.889
 so formed the bow even above now 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:18.509
 we enter all these again 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.509
 last seven rocaille 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:30.040
 we insert a b cone on the thread and we enter 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.500
 in the following seven these below 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.140
 in short, the first we have included 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.460
 we are therefore leaving this bow 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:42.180
 in this case we also insert a b cone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:47.400
 and we slip into the upper headband 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:51.130
 coming out of the fourth fortress of this 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.790
 the fourth arch that just that 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.190
 central 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.840
 here you are once you get out of this 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.090
 fortress the weft 3 fortress 11 0 e 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.830
 let's go inside these places 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:13.110
 from which we came out and pass 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.450
 let's review the thread inside this one 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.100
 let's say this about this understanding 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.270
 several times to make it more stable 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.550
 then hide the thread inside 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.180
 of processing we cut the surplus e 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:32.050
 let's pass in this coat i 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.480
 two rings and then the pin clearly 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.330
 here for the ear we have done 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.070
 then pass the 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.920
 neither the rings nor inside this one 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.140
 then we created the drawer 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.860
 hooked our cute pin 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.930
 with flowers 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.970

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.500
