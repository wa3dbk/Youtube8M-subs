00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
up and then you need to have the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.510 
up and then you need to have the
throttle<00:02:49.090> completely<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.010> max<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.250> get<00:02:51.400> it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
throttle completely to the max to get it

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.770 
throttle completely to the max to get it
off<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.850> ground<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.209> then<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.420> would<00:02:52.540> end<00:02:52.690> up

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
off the ground and then you would end up

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.930 
off the ground and then you would end up
kind<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.830> lifting<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.280> too<00:02:54.400> much<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.850> would

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
kind of lifting it too much and it would

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.270 
kind of lifting it too much and it would
