00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
couple other important steps that I'm

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.380 
couple other important steps that I'm
talking<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.440> today<00:00:37.980> before<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.940> start

always<00:00:39.989> remember<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> golden<00:00:41.070> rule<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.670> an

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
always remember the golden rule about an

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.970 
always remember the golden rule about an
enemies<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> mind<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> their<00:00:43.500> own

enemies they have a mind of their own

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
enemies they have a mind of their own
therefore<00:00:44.789> they'll<00:00:45.090> move<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> park

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
therefore they'll move and park

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
therefore they'll move and park
themselves<00:00:45.989> wherever<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
themselves wherever they want if you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and you think moving it will solve your

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
and you think moving it will solve your
problems<00:00:51.329> you're<00:00:51.870> better<00:00:52.079> off<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.320> even

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
problems you're better off not even

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
trying as in any way move back to where

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.040 
trying as in any way move back to where
it<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.640> bottom<00:00:56.640> line<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.239> anenome<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.870> do

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
it was bottom line the anenome will do

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.790 
it was bottom line the anenome will do
what<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> wants<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.219> deal<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.649> most

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
what it wants so deal with it the most

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
what it wants so deal with it the most
important<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> remember<00:01:02.550> about

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
important thing to remember about

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
important thing to remember about
removing<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.629> enemies<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> don't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
removing an enemies is that you don't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
removing an enemies is that you don't
want<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.100> forceful<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.820> potentially

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
want to be forceful and potentially

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
want to be forceful and potentially
damage<00:01:06.780> them<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.770> tear<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> anenome

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
damage them if you tear the anenome

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
damage them if you tear the anenome
especially<00:01:09.180> its<00:01:09.330> foot<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.049> animal<00:01:10.439> will

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
especially its foot the animal will

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.670 
especially its foot the animal will
likely<00:01:10.770> die<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.360> firm<00:01:12.630> yet<00:01:13.140> gentle<00:01:13.170> and

likely die so be firm yet gentle and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.450 
likely die so be firm yet gentle and
don't<00:01:14.130> rush<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> process<00:01:16.040> for<00:01:17.040> those<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
don't rush the process for those of you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.950 
don't rush the process for those of you

results let's have a look at the near

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.120 
results let's have a look at the near
best-case<00:01:21.299> scenario<00:01:21.720> first<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.770> I'll<00:01:22.920> show

best-case scenario first then I'll show
you<00:01:23.189> worst<00:01:23.549> case<00:01:23.850> scenario<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> what

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you worst case scenario which is what

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.679 
you worst case scenario which is what
happened<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.460> wait<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.729> said<00:01:27.270> near

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
happened to me wait I said near

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
happened to me wait I said near
best-case<00:01:28.259> scenario<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
best-case scenario well what is the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.510 
best-case scenario well what is the
best-case<00:01:30.540> scenario<00:01:30.619> best-case<00:01:31.619> scenario<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
best-case scenario best-case scenario is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
best-case scenario best-case scenario is
if<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> enemy<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.240> already<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.750> motion<00:01:33.990> like

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
if the enemy is already in motion like

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
if the enemy is already in motion like
it's<00:01:34.619> walking<00:01:34.799> across<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.369> tank<00:01:35.579> why<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's walking across your tank why is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
it's walking across your tank why is
that<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> best<00:01:37.049> case<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.729> they're

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that the best case because if they're

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
that the best case because if they're
already<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.299> motion<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.650> easiest<00:01:41.070> time

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
already in motion it's the easiest time

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.069 
already in motion it's the easiest time
to<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.060> them<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.479> their<00:01:42.689> foot<00:01:42.930> isn't

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
to get them off because their foot isn't

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.660 
to get them off because their foot isn't
attached<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.740> usually<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.520> where

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
attached it's usually right there where

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
attached it's usually right there where
you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> work<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.380> can

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you can go to work on it and you can

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
you can go to work on it and you can
easily<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.100> enemy<00:01:47.220> off<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.000> let's<00:01:48.210> look

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
easily get to an enemy off so let's look

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.389 
easily get to an enemy off so let's look
at<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> near<00:01:48.780> best-case<00:01:49.320> scenario<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
at the near best-case scenario which is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
at the near best-case scenario which is
if<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> anatomy<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.299> attached<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.780> flat

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
if the anatomy is attached to a flat

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.590 
if the anatomy is attached to a flat
surface<00:01:52.100> like<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.460> tank<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
surface like on this tank here the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.969 
surface like on this tank here the
anenome<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.020> attached<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
anenome is attached to the back of the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
anenome is attached to the back of the
tank<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.000> easily<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> its<00:01:57.780> foot<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
tank so I can easily get to its foot to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.469 
tank so I can easily get to its foot to
remove<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.520> high<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.060> which

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
remove it and it's up high as well which

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.980 
remove it and it's up high as well which
makes<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.960> extra<00:02:01.350> nice<00:02:02.450> once<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
makes it extra nice once you can get to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
makes it extra nice once you can get to
the<00:02:04.110> foot<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> anatomy<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the foot of the anatomy you want to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700 
the foot of the anatomy you want to
gently<00:02:06.090> massage<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:07.020> finger<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
gently massage it with your finger to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.180 
gently massage it with your finger to
encourage<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> detach

whatever route you go you're likely had

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.770 
whatever route you go you're likely had
to<00:02:15.280> massage<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.819> for<00:02:16.000> several<00:02:16.420> minutes<00:02:16.569> before

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
to massage it for several minutes before

to massage it for several minutes before
it<00:02:17.140> starts<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.530> let<00:02:17.770> go<00:02:17.980> therefore<00:02:18.880> be<00:02:19.569> patient

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
it starts to let go therefore be patient

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.180 
it starts to let go therefore be patient
and<00:02:20.170> stay<00:02:20.500> after<00:02:20.920> it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and stay after it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.240 
and stay after it
notice<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:22.030> gently<00:02:22.510> massaging<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> foot<00:02:23.620> not

again<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:27.280> want<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.610> be<00:02:27.790> gentle<00:02:29.700> once<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
again we want to be gentle once the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240 
again we want to be gentle once the
anenome<00:02:31.090> starts<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.630> let<00:02:31.810> go<00:02:31.989> focus<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.130> the

anenome starts to let go focus on the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.860 
anenome starts to let go focus on the
area<00:02:33.520> where<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.819> foot<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.060> attaching<00:02:34.690> to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
area where the foot is attaching to

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.500 
area where the foot is attaching to
encourage<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.709> let<00:02:35.980> go<00:02:36.160> more<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:37.269> few

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
encourage it to let go more in a few

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.449 
encourage it to let go more in a few
minutes<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.080> enemy<00:02:38.410> will<00:02:38.590> let<00:02:38.769> go<00:02:38.980> until<00:02:39.280> it

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
minutes the enemy will let go until it

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.130 
minutes the enemy will let go until it
eventually<00:02:39.640> completely<00:02:40.480> lets<00:02:40.870> go<00:02:43.140> there's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
eventually completely lets go there's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.840 
eventually completely lets go there's
always<00:02:44.290> more<00:02:44.680> than<00:02:44.830> one<00:02:44.950> way<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.160> skin<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.519> cat

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
always more than one way to skin a cat

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.729 
always more than one way to skin a cat
so<00:02:46.510> let's<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.870> look<00:02:46.989> at<00:02:47.110> other<00:02:47.290> ways<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
so let's have a look at other ways to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.440 
so let's have a look at other ways to
remove<00:02:47.980> an<00:02:48.130> enemy's<00:02:48.430> before<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:48.850> show<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.150> my

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
remove an enemy's before I show you my

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.320 
remove an enemy's before I show you my
worst<00:02:49.780> case<00:02:50.019> scenario<00:02:50.580> now<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.970> could<00:02:52.150> try

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
worst case scenario now you could try

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.940 
worst case scenario now you could try
frying<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.959> anatomy<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.650> strongly

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
frying in the anatomy which I strongly

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.940 
frying in the anatomy which I strongly
don't<00:02:54.519> recommend<00:02:55.390> some<00:02:56.350> people<00:02:56.620> think<00:02:56.799> it's<00:02:56.890> a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
don't recommend some people think it's a

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.979 
don't recommend some people think it's a
good<00:02:56.980> idea<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.819> don't<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.269> please<00:02:58.690> don't

good idea but I don't and please don't

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.860 
good idea but I don't and please don't
try<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.819> could<00:03:00.819> try<00:03:01.030> taking<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.420> rock<00:03:01.630> out

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
try it you could try taking the rock out

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.660 
try it you could try taking the rock out

tank that option is out therefore we

tank that option is out therefore we
have<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.250> look<00:03:15.310> at<00:03:15.519> some<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.850> tank<00:03:16.150> options<00:03:16.690> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
have to look at some in tank options you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.380 
have to look at some in tank options you
could<00:03:17.859> get<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> bag<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.459> ice<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:18.880> put<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.209> next

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
could get a bag of ice and put it next

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.930 
could get a bag of ice and put it next
to<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.630> anenome<00:03:19.930> if<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.709> go<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.130> route<00:03:21.340> make

to the anenome if you go this route make

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.789 
to the anenome if you go this route make
sure<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.209> touch<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.690> enemy<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.230> then<00:03:23.620> take

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.840 
don't leave the bag line on the anenome
also<00:03:29.590> keep<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.890> mind<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.220> unless<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.700> can

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
also keep in mind that unless you can

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.699 
also keep in mind that unless you can
get<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> enemy's<00:03:31.540> foot<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.410> will<00:03:32.530> likely

get to the enemy's foot it will likely

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.220

shrink<00:03:33.220> up<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.609> avoid<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.060> ice<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:34.989> ice<00:03:35.200> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
shrink up to avoid the ice so ice is

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.740 
shrink up to avoid the ice so ice is
okay<00:03:35.799> but<00:03:36.070> it's<00:03:36.190> only<00:03:36.489> useful<00:03:36.730> if<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.510> get

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750
