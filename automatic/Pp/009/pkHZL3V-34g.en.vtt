00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.639
 today's video is a little video 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:17.740
 particular because I show you how 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:21.039
 assemble a birthday cake that 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.330
 however it is based on candy this is 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.920
 an idea that my friend gave me 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:32.920
 stefania hi stefy who made it for 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.180
 his daughter eva and greeting as well and I wanted 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.070
 do it too 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 so now we do it together vi 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.570
 I show what it is 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.489
 and above all what you need then 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.769
 you need polystyrene and 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.489
 these can be found in cake shops 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.120
 design 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.420
 I recommend this because what 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 I found myself if you are from the Axa area 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 you can go take a look 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.850
 it is the first time he will check though 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.859
 thank goodness that in short there is everything there 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 everything for the cake design is called miss 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.920
 cake ailog cake design and of which 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.600
 I make ideas even where he took it then 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.610
 these two forms in total are me 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.400
 cost three I hope I think two euros 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.620
 this is a little one this euro then 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.090
 you see what size you want to make it 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.920
 however, the assembled cake will tell you yes 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.110
 I'm backlighting I hope you see it all then 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.210
 what do you need the candle with a pay 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.910
 in short, you can put on plastic 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.740
 in the middle I decided to do it with i 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.050
 two peace has taken several 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.900
 you can also take magnitudes 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.120
 closed candies and stick them with the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.770
 glue with hot glue maybe you do 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.720
 easy off 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.750
 or put with toothpicks 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.370
 fresh candies as it did 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.320
 what my friend stefania in short 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.600
 I could only do it with supershocks 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.140
 because it is easier for me to slip them on 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.080
 in the cake and I took these 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.420
 this is the market they come around 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.620
 not even 2 euros per envelope these me 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.600
 I remember those in mini format 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.680
 rimini that I will put in the middle of those 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.430
 great 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.460
 then you need toothpicks for 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.530
 go and fix the top with the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.720
 under the cake I decided to 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.970
 paint it and or acrylics here 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.890
 Tommaso's favorite colors because yes 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.900
 he's talking about Tommaso's birthday 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.310
 given the number 6 on Color Color 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 Thomas's favorites are blue is 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.900
 down there the green the blue I will do so 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.700
 then a brush a small bowl for 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 just mix the water with the acrylic 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.490
 because I would like it to dry immediately 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.770
 that it didn't take us so long 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.900
 now I'll show you how to proceed with 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.520
 assembling the cake one 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.410
 step is to go and color 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.560
 precisely our forms of polystyrene 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.800
 I hope you see well and I decided to 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.780
 make the top part in green is 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.320
 that of the base and the whole round of 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:03.800
 polystyrene cylinders in blue with i 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:07.310
 I chose an acrylic because yes 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.530
 it definitely dries up after it dispersed ad 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.360
 other things to others run into 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.370
 quiet without getting my hands dirty I 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.470
 put a toothpick under the base 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.500
 because then this is the basis that 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.480
 will go you will not see the part below and it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.940
 same I do with the other that's why 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.100
 I don't use gloves that genius but now 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.630
 I proceed with a second layer of green 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.630
 above because as you see I went a 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.920
 bit out with the color but dried it 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.940
 in a hurry with the hair dryer 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.010
 this to make it easier for you to manage the times 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.580
 or drying the hair dryer with air 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.430
 cold is perfect 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.720
 and continue I continue and see you 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.060
 now that my pasi are 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.640
 perfectly colored and dried with 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.850
 the white acrylic rallall hair dryer because 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.850
 I want to give the idea of ​​icing on 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.190
 just edges of the two cylinders e 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.420
 black acrylic to write precisely 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.270
 best wishes tommaso at the head of the cake there 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.760
 let's see my glaze won on the piece 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.550
 back of the cake and left it 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.670
 a bit big because I like the effect 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.130
 3d of the own cream coming down e 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.459
 now I also do it on the cylinder more 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.560
 small both below and above I wrote 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.960
 tommy wishes leaving the space here at 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.930
 center for the candle that is this here 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.670
 it is a classic base and it fits 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.530
 evening quietly up here then 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.200
 land to decorate with if necessary 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.210
 a little something and this is the result I have to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.390
 simply put some 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.370
 toothpick below and skewering the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.740
 upper part on the back 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.070
 however this is the result I hope 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.810
 see well why I know backlight however it is 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.850
 the ideal place to put envoys 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.990
 toothpicks under the upper base e 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.650
 now I'm going to hit it perfectly 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.790
 sorry the center of the cake e 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.790
 I'm going to slip in with force 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:15.780
 here is perfectly fixed 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:19.380
 assembled and now I proceed to insert 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.030

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.039
 this is the first with each other 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.130
 all around perfectly made 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.530

 the writing above is here tommy wishes 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.810
 a bit even on patches though the

 where food is not allowed 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.389
 from the outside, these sheets will be eaten 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.000
 quietly at home 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.120
