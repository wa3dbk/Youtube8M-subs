00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:13.769
 Hello, today I want to talk about 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:17.390
 his first experience with kaydeksa he 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.820
 was say my first not always 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.310
 positive about it a little bit wanna 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 quite possibly tell someone this 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.700
 useful first matching did 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.079
 important here on this nose i heard that kylix 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.829
 can scratch a blade 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.960
 but how much I didn't know to insert 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.960
 then let's say some leather spacers 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 if our worker is correspondingly quite 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.260
 both moisture and dirt are possible 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 then it may fall 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.219
 skin respectively from her I think so 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 what will be more harm than good here and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.399
 The first knife I decided to do was account 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 I sheathe did everything like 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.560
 fine 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.460
 how would a knife normally hide with 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 normal goes snaps everything clearly 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 but 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.799
 but that's what i got 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.799
 will now be seen 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:45.960
 that is, scratches began to appear 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:49.409
 such here 2 needed accordingly decided 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 what to do with it well decided 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:59.380
 wrap lamprey tape 2 you need to do 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.920
 Again, everything worked out perfectly. 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.979
 there is a slight play inside the most 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.789
 small but the knife is not scratched personally 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.980
 Comes in but is boring to roll straight 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.340
 pretty problematic and turned out 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.750
 such perry overlaps are big 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.030
 respectively, these overlap and here you see 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.040
 they manifested in principle 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.650
 looks so interesting but just suddenly 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.010
 someone does not like it let's say it is worth 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.010
 take this into account 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.900
 but the problem is let's say so with scratches 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 it's decided 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:44.319
 Respectively then I already did 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.250
 this nose but here is just fat 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.160
 Double-sided tape 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.319
 was glued on both sides exactly 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.880
 cut off and here you can get even 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.380
 later comes in and goes great if u 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.819
 will become practically 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:08.650
 little-little committing but in 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.500
 principle just like here here only 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.519
 only additionally decided it 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.519
 Deal such a deepening to 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.120
 Respectively better knife is fixed on 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.040
 fixed on so very securely all this 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.269
 I did not at home all this I did in 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:36.100
 business trip, respectively, the person I 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:40.419
 rather put such a simple 10 8 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:45.669
 millimeters thickness is required 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:48.400
 the angle must be at least 45 degrees in 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:51.519
 general principle tested tested places 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.739
 knives were worn like this for several days 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.410
 that is, the belt is disengaged without any 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:01.389
 problems fly off it does not fly then 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.370
 There is to remove say so knife time then 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.169
 you need to finger yourself, respectively 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.489
 bend the collections then pull out already 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:12.489
 the knife itself you flies me no 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:17.199
 way the only supplier of which 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.669
 I took Kaidexa everything else sent 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.680
 I have a lot of short grommets 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:29.289
 so on the other hand they look 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:34.870
 a little bit here and so well I think for food 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:38.889
 in length so now what I used 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.460
 still in principle can not do this here 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.580
 hairdryer to warm kaydeksa 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:54.550
 Well, I got in Lerua Merlini rubles 600 he 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:59.030
 worth the things are great accordingly here 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.780
 such a dremel 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.000
 because manually rub the sandpaper as with 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.240
 pretty badly handled then 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.440
 there is handled normally but if it 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.920
 did eat some big 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.110
 without a drill or without need for food here 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:22.730
 press is not enough press i did 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.740
 Pretty simple, I'll show you all now. 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:32.390
 from scrap materials that is 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:36.260
 settings here press plywood itself such 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.440
 loops are usual too by the way leroy merlin and 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.210
 purchased scotch oh that is 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:50.330
 thermo foam rubber glued double sided 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:53.950
 scotch tape locking system focus 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.480
 magic trick 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.660
 the locking system came up pretty 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.630
 simple that is, these are the wedges 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.890
 plywood 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:09.980
 sticking a court knife is permissible and 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:13.960
 packaging is very easy to fix 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:18.260
 wedges can be fixed 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.630
 respectively press deeper press 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:27.590
 will work accordingly and 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:35.530
 they are also easy to take off the system 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:35.530
 very simple let's say so very affordable 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.570
 press works fine i like that 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.600
 I've seen seen there and people burned 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.260
 did swept off with what on screed 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.740
 everything else is nothing 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:54.970
 enough of such a simple solution 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.850
 but basically everything I wanted to say 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.510
 I had this first experience 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:05.860
 everyone will be helpful thanks to all 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.860
 for watching bye
