is a control arm in the shape of a of an
A<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.710> C<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:57.949> sits<00:00:58.949> over<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.550> that's<00:01:00.920> tied

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
A and C it's sits over here that's tied

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.359 
A and C it's sits over here that's tied
to<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> bushing<00:01:02.550> here's<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> bushing<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.369> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to a bushing here's the bushing and it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.480 
to a bushing here's the bushing and it
goes<00:01:05.519> back<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> pumpkin<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:08.220> might<00:01:08.369> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
goes back to the pumpkin and it might be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.140 
goes back to the pumpkin and it might be
hard<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:09.290> but<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> sits<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.830> top<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:12.710> the

hard to see but it sits on top of the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.670 
hard to see but it sits on top of the
differential<00:01:15.150> goes<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> another

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
differential goes over to another

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
differential goes over to another
bushing<00:01:17.189> over<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.460> new

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.700 
out these bushings so I have to take off
these<00:01:47.130> three<00:01:47.460> bolts<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.079> sitting<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.530> on

these three bolts and it's sitting up on
top<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:51.200> differential<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.680> very

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
long so I went over to a local heart

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.550

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:27.800 
bolts it's and on top of the
differential<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:21.180> really<00:03:21.450> tight<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.690> now

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
differential it's really tight so now

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.349

that<00:03:27.840> it's<00:03:28.109> down<00:03:28.380> on<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.040> ground<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:30.090> four

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
that it's down on the ground on all four

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.930 
that it's down on the ground on all four
wheels<00:03:30.590> now<00:03:31.590> what<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:31.889> do<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.010> we<00:03:32.250> tighten<00:03:32.519> up

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
wheels now what we do is we tighten up

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.009 
wheels now what we do is we tighten up
these<00:03:33.209> bolts<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.000> don't<00:03:36.180> put<00:03:36.329> undue<00:03:36.630> stress

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
these bolts so we don't put undue stress

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.289 
these bolts so we don't put undue stress
on<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.500> bushings<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.489> we'll<00:03:38.609> do<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.880> now<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
on the bushings so we'll do that now and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:58.250 
on the bushings so we'll do that now and
then<00:03:39.389> we'll<00:03:39.510> take<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> for<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> test<00:03:40.049> drive

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.000 

and<00:03:59.260> let's<00:03:59.620> get<00:03:59.769> this<00:03:59.980> one<00:04:00.159> since<00:04:00.340> always<00:04:02.010> if

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
and let's get this one since always if
