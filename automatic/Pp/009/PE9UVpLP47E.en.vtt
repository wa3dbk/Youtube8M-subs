00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.170 
and open this at the same time okay so i
took<00:02:26.610> taking<00:02:27.600> off<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> plastic<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.910> box

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
took taking off the plastic the box

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.470 
took taking off the plastic the box
feels<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.530> cheap<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> i'm

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
feels really really really cheap so i'm

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.199 
feels really really really cheap so i'm
assuming<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.590> box<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.190> game<00:02:36.000> is

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
assuming it's a box in the game is

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.510 
assuming it's a box in the game is
inside<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.930> case<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.620> there's<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.370> some

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
inside a case and there's just some

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.630 
inside a case and there's just some
other<00:02:38.700> stuff<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:43.550> yeah<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.580> figured<00:02:46.640> so

other stuff in here yeah I figured so

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.840 
other stuff in here yeah I figured so

the code because I almost showed it to
you<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:57.660> looks<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:57.900> cool<00:03:02.120> will<00:03:03.120> you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
you that looks really cool will you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.750 
you that looks really cool will you
cross<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.840> line<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.640> game<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
cross the line so this is the game and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.009

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
guess this is the bank and I I see this

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.280 
guess this is the bank and I I see this
is<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.450> bank<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> looks<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.079> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
is the bank so it looks like it's a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.199 
is the bank so it looks like it's a
