00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the brownies is the one with the white

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
the brownies is the one with the white
on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> top<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.070> made<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.509> cream

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
on the top this one I made a cream

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.730 
on the top this one I made a cream
cheese<00:01:16.820> frosting<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:19.229> threw<00:01:19.560> some

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
walnuts on the top but I also thought

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.740 
walnuts on the top but I also thought
that<00:01:22.380> maybe<00:01:22.830> someone<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> see

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

that maybe someone would want to see
what<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> brownie<00:01:25.500> looked<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.130> without<00:01:27.650> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
what the brownie looked like without the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.360 
what the brownie looked like without the
frosting<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.170> yeah
