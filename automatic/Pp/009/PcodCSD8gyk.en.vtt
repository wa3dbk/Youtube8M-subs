00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the way that he's been acting for the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.550 
the way that he's been acting for the
past<00:00:25.619> year<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:25.949> such<00:00:26.810> over<00:00:27.810> him<00:00:27.960> dropping<00:00:28.320> his

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
past year and such over him dropping his

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.439 
past year and such over him dropping his
belt<00:00:28.830> even<00:00:29.130> though<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.699> technically<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.330> know

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
belt even though like technically I know

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.959 
belt even though like technically I know
is<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.590> wasn't<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> him<00:00:32.279> but

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
is it really really wasn't up to him but

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.670 
is it really really wasn't up to him but
the<00:00:33.120> reasoning<00:00:33.540> he<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.809> putting<00:00:34.050> behind<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the reasoning he was putting behind it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
the reasoning he was putting behind it
like<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> money<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.640> enough<00:00:36.090> yada<00:00:36.390> yada

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
like all the money was enough yada yada

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
like all the money was enough yada yada
and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> sudden<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.550> talk

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and then like all of a sudden like talk

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.260 
and then like all of a sudden like talk
couple<00:00:39.780> weeks<00:00:39.960> ago<00:00:40.309> he<00:00:41.309> started<00:00:41.370> saying<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
couple weeks ago he started saying that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
couple weeks ago he started saying that
the<00:00:42.719> reasoning<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.250> his<00:00:44.460> uncle's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the reasoning was we do his uncle's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.310 
the reasoning was we do his uncle's
unfortunate<00:00:45.420> passing<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> birth<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.140> his

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
unfortunate passing in the birth of his

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
unfortunate passing in the birth of his
son<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.610> something<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.969> he<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
son which is something like he really

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.479 
son which is something like he really
should<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.750> set<00:00:48.899> from<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> beginning

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
should just set from the beginning

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
should just set from the beginning
because<00:00:50.489> had<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.090> he<00:00:51.239> say<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.750> can't

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110

say he would not have got as much heat

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.670

from<00:01:05.939> chopping<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> belt<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.320> since<00:01:07.530> he

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
didn't like say what was really going on
I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:10.049> his<00:01:11.010> life<00:01:11.220> he<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.850> blamed<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.119> on

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I think in his life he just blamed it on

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
I think in his life he just blamed it on
like<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.869> money<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.350> being<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
like the money not being there and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.179 
like the money not being there and
whatever<00:01:14.369> else<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:15.000> excuses<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:16.650> part

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
whatever else is excuses was that's part

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
whatever else is excuses was that's part
of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> reason<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:17.670> he's<00:01:18.060> taking<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of the reason why he's taking all that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.920 
of the reason why he's taking all that
heat<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.240> side<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.630> Andy

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
heat but on to like this side was Andy

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.380 
heat but on to like this side was Andy
Lee<00:01:22.080> didn't<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.619> weight<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.640> he<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.180> not

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
Lee didn't make weight so he was not

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
Lee didn't make weight so he was not
able<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.290> thought<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.710> won<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> fight<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
able to I thought he won the fight I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
able to I thought he won the fight I
guess<00:01:26.759> annually<00:01:27.119> tonight<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.200> unable

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
guess annually tonight but he was unable

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
guess annually tonight but he was unable
to<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> belt<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.220> he<00:01:29.430> dropped<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:31.909> when

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to get the belt that he dropped and when

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
to get the belt that he dropped and when
he<00:01:32.970> didn't<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> coral<00:01:33.810> bar<00:01:33.960> fight<00:01:34.170> he

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
he didn't take the coral bar fight he

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
he didn't take the coral bar fight he
was<00:01:34.409> unable<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.040> belt<00:01:35.250> back<00:01:35.340> tonight

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
was unable to get that belt back tonight

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
was unable to get that belt back tonight
because<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:36.780> didn't<00:01:37.020> make<00:01:37.140> weight<00:01:37.380> he<00:01:38.100> weighed

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because he didn't make weight he weighed

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.510 
because he didn't make weight he weighed
in<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.579> 161<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.630> believe<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.259> wasn't<00:01:41.040> sure<00:01:41.220> if

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
see these two if I again possibly maybe

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.420 
see these two if I again possibly maybe
have<00:04:27.190> 140<00:04:28.000> pounds<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:29.140> even<00:04:29.260> then<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.860> don't<00:04:30.130> I

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
have 140 pounds but even then I don't I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.130 
have 140 pounds but even then I don't I
don't<00:04:31.030> believe<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.750> going<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.960> happen<00:04:32.110> I

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
don't believe it's going to happen I

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.100 
don't believe it's going to happen I
think<00:04:35.140> Danny's<00:04:35.500> next<00:04:35.860> fight<00:04:36.040> hopefully<00:04:37.110> this
