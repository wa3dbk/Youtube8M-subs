one more move well this was in the case
we<00:05:34.039> went<00:05:34.789> over<00:05:35.120> 12<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.599> 16<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.320> right<00:05:36.710> away<00:05:36.830> we

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
we went over 12 to 16 and right away we

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.390 
we went over 12 to 16 and right away we
seen<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.490> was<00:05:37.580> going<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:37.760> lose<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.030> check

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
seen it was going to lose the check

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.070 
seen it was going to lose the check
but<00:05:39.000> with<00:05:39.150> them<00:05:39.300> we<00:05:39.449> didn't<00:05:39.690> check<00:05:39.840> out<00:05:40.020> any

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
but with them we didn't check out any

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.409 
but with them we didn't check out any
moves<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:41.010> follow<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:41.880> now<00:05:42.030> we're<00:05:42.210> going<00:05:42.300> to

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
moves to follow so now we're going to

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:52.720 
moves to follow so now we're going to
follow<00:05:43.520> 24<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.639> 19<00:05:46.100> red<00:05:47.100> jumps

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.040 

and<00:05:53.270> white<00:05:53.450> jumps<00:05:53.810> too<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:54.740> true<00:05:56.050> that's

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
and white jumps too so it's true that's

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.400 
and white jumps too so it's true that's
up<00:05:58.360> White's<00:05:59.360> up<00:05:59.570> a<00:05:59.630> checker<00:06:00.400> but<00:06:02.140> what's<00:06:03.140> in

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
up White's up a checker but what's in

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.670 
up White's up a checker but what's in
the<00:06:04.040> self-destruct<00:06:04.490> position<00:06:07.420> 10<00:06:08.420> to<00:06:08.600> 15<00:06:09.760> now

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
the self-destruct position 10 to 15 now

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.180 
the self-destruct position 10 to 15 now
Mike's<00:06:12.680> vensica<00:06:13.160> Manowar<00:06:14.030> covered<00:06:14.740> so<00:06:15.740> the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
Mike's vensica Manowar covered so the

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.090 
Mike's vensica Manowar covered so the
only<00:06:16.370> move<00:06:17.050> white<00:06:18.050> could<00:06:18.260> go<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.410> hit<00:06:18.710> but<00:06:18.830> he<00:06:18.920> be

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
only move white could go a hit but he be

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.280 
only move white could go a hit but he be
giving<00:06:19.370> up<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.550> check-in<00:06:19.820> and<00:06:20.150> so<00:06:20.300> Tula<00:06:20.600> so

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
giving up a check-in and so Tula so

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.780 
giving up a check-in and so Tula so
white<00:06:21.500> goes<00:06:21.880> 12<00:06:22.880> to<00:06:23.030> 8<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:23.420> here<00:06:24.230> it<00:06:24.500> goes<00:06:24.790> 15

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
white goes 12 to 8 and here it goes 15

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.600 
white goes 12 to 8 and here it goes 15
to<00:06:26.690> 18<00:06:27.370> right<00:06:28.370> chumps<00:06:29.080> red<00:06:30.080> jumps<00:06:30.470> -<00:06:30.710> he<00:06:31.220> has<00:06:31.400> to

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
to 18 right chumps red jumps - he has to

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.340 
to 18 right chumps red jumps - he has to
switch<00:06:31.850> a<00:06:32.000> room<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.390> it's<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:32.870> jewel<00:06:33.140> from

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
switch a room and it's the jewel from

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:42.100 
switch a room and it's the jewel from
here<00:06:38.590> this<00:06:39.590> is<00:06:39.650> an<00:06:39.980> interesting<00:06:40.280> thinking<00:06:41.110> how

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
here this is an interesting thinking how

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.190 
here this is an interesting thinking how
the<00:06:42.170> same<00:06:42.710> position<00:06:43.220> for<00:06:43.430> white<00:06:44.210> comes<00:06:44.780> up<00:06:44.930> for

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
the same position for white comes up for

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.440 
the same position for white comes up for
red<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:47.210> it's<00:06:47.450> a<00:06:47.570> good<00:06:47.750> a<00:06:48.050> good<00:06:49.060> lesson<00:06:50.060> to

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
red and and it's a good a good lesson to

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.890 
red and and it's a good a good lesson to
learn

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
learn

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.320 
learn
