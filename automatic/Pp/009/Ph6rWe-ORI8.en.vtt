you haven't got to worry too much about
kind<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.329> blending<00:03:08.840> but<00:03:09.379> just<00:03:09.590> blend<00:03:09.829> if<00:03:09.950> you

need to it doesn't look a lot it's quite

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.809 
need to it doesn't look a lot it's quite
subtle<00:03:12.109> but<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.500> really<00:03:12.769> does<00:03:13.040> work<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.640> then

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
subtle but it really does work and then
