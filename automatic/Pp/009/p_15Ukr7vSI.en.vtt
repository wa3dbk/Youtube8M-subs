00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
fights but it gives you an idea of what

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.490 
fights but it gives you an idea of what
their<00:01:09.840> games<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:11.150> do<00:01:12.150> start<00:01:12.570> quite<00:01:13.020> low<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
their games like do start quite low of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.249 
their games like do start quite low of
the<00:01:13.939> dispatcher<00:01:14.939> abuse<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:16.110> nothing

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the dispatcher abuse there's nothing

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
the dispatcher abuse there's nothing
compared<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> other<00:01:17.280> side

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
compared to the other side

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950 
compared to the other side
or<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> good<00:01:19.799> start<00:01:20.630> break<00:01:21.630> break

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
or that's not a good start break break

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.550 
or that's not a good start break break
break<00:01:22.079> break<00:01:22.610> punch<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:27.560> yeah

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
break break punch see that's what yeah

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.219 
break break punch see that's what yeah
so<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.119> think<00:01:30.119> goes<00:01:30.270> where<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> hope

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
so it's think goes where there's a hope

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
so it's think goes where there's a hope
