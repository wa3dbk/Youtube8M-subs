00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
articulation good this thing I think has

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.250 
articulation good this thing I think has
eight<00:02:55.920> points<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.370> articulation<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:57.260> course

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
eight points on articulation of course

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.300 
eight points on articulation of course
arms<00:02:59.870> move<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.140> down<00:03:01.609> um<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.650> what's<00:03:05.129> it

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
arms move up and down um the what's it

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:14.360 
arms move up and down um the what's it
called<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.819> legs<00:03:10.010> inward<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.489> outward<00:03:13.370> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
called the legs inward and outward and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.059 
called the legs inward and outward and
so<00:03:14.880> does<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.630> make<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.139> main<00:03:16.410> part<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
so does this make the main part of the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.289 
so does this make the main part of the
leg<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:18.079> so<00:03:19.079> ya<00:03:19.519> know<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.880> different

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
leg right here so ya know this different

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.020 
leg right here so ya know this different
hard<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> move<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:22.049> get<00:03:22.470> moves<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:26.030> thing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
hard to move but get moves and the thing

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.490 
hard to move but get moves and the thing
right<00:03:27.239> here<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.599> connects<00:03:28.019> like<00:03:28.169> that<00:03:28.349> one

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
right here that connects like that one

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.430 
right here that connects like that one
ankle<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.880> moves<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.989> yeah

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
ankle is that moves you and so yeah

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.670 
ankle is that moves you and so yeah
remember<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.250> double<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.150> legs<00:03:39.680> so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
remember to double that for the legs so

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.390 
remember to double that for the legs so
yeah<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.940> would<00:03:42.510> be<00:03:42.660> 9u<00:03:43.410> town<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.190> mouth

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
yeah it would be 9u town to the mouth

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.569 
yeah it would be 9u town to the mouth
which<00:03:44.819> can<00:03:45.380> what<00:03:46.380> since<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.799> rubber<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
which can what since it's a rubber and

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.220 
which can what since it's a rubber and
there's<00:03:47.760> nothing<00:03:48.060> there<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.239> hold<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.750> no

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
there's nothing there to hold it no

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.250 
there's nothing there to hold it no
structure<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.489> yeah<00:03:51.329> then<00:03:51.630> looks<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:51.989> we<00:03:52.109> go

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
structure so yeah then looks like we go

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430 
structure so yeah then looks like we go
again<00:03:52.620> um<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:54.540> thing<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.200> makes<00:03:55.319> it

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
again um the thing that makes it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.720 
again um the thing that makes it
probably<00:03:55.919> one<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.220> most<00:03:56.370> realistic

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
probably one of the most realistic

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.240 
probably one of the most realistic
things<00:03:57.120> are<00:03:57.329> heat<00:03:57.870> which<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.590> very<00:03:58.739> whitish
