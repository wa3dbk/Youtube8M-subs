Frozr 5 which funnily enough has 5 new

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.140 
Frozr 5 which funnily enough has 5 new
features<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.760> all<00:00:17.820> there's<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
features on it first of all there's the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.330 
features on it first of all there's the
LED<00:00:18.570> logo<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.170> kind<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> top<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.100> card

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
LED logo on kind of a top of the card

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.560 
LED logo on kind of a top of the card
which<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.760> nice<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> actually

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
which is nice because this is actually

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.090 
which is nice because this is actually
somewhere<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.230> you'll<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.560> seeing<00:00:22.890> these

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
somewhere will you'll be seeing these

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650 
somewhere will you'll be seeing these
things<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.670> lot<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.939> times<00:00:24.090> you'll<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.359> really

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
things a lot of times you'll see really

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.589 
things a lot of times you'll see really
cool<00:00:24.869> graphics<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.710> design<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.910> front<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
cool graphics or design on the front of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.939 
cool graphics or design on the front of
the<00:00:27.840> card<00:00:28.080> where<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> fans<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.710> which<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the card where the fans are which you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
the card where the fans are which you
won't<00:00:29.730> often<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.050> nice<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.320> able

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
won't often see so it's nice to be able

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.410 
won't often see so it's nice to be able
to<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.650> stuff<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.579> LED<00:00:32.910> logo<00:00:33.239> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
to see stuff where this LED logo is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
to see stuff where this LED logo is
after<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> super<00:00:34.829> su<00:00:35.430> pipe

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
after that we have this super su pipe

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
after that we have this super su pipe
which<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.149> basically<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.170> giant<00:00:37.230> freaking

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
which is basically just a giant freaking

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
which is basically just a giant freaking
heat<00:00:38.070> pipe<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> kind<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> around<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
heat pipe going to kind of around the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
heat pipe going to kind of around the
middle<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> card<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> backwards<00:00:41.040> S

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
middle of the card in a backwards S

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
middle of the card in a backwards S
shape<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.120> should<00:00:42.329> hopefully<00:00:42.450> help<00:00:42.750> with

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
shape which should hopefully help with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
shape which should hopefully help with
cooling<00:00:43.320> after<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.250> 0<00:00:44.520> frozer

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
cooling after that we have 0 frozer

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
cooling after that we have 0 frozer
which<00:00:45.180> might<00:00:45.390> scare<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.170> because

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
which might scare some of you because

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
which might scare some of you because
one<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> fans<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> not<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> spin

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
one of the fans is not going to spin

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
one of the fans is not going to spin
under<00:00:48.899> 50<00:00:49.170> degrees<00:00:49.469> Celsius

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
under 50 degrees Celsius

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
under 50 degrees Celsius
but<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.789> okay<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.360> cards<00:00:51.660> fine<00:00:51.899> once<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
but it's okay the cards fine once it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
but it's okay the cards fine once it
gets<00:00:52.530> above<00:00:52.680> 50<00:00:52.920> degrees<00:00:52.980> Celsius<00:00:53.340> both<00:00:53.820> fans

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
gets above 50 degrees Celsius both fans

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
gets above 50 degrees Celsius both fans
will<00:00:54.300> engage<00:00:54.750> also<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.010> new<00:00:56.160> gaming

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
will engage also there's the new gaming

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.180 
will engage also there's the new gaming
app<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.300> afterburner<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
app it's not afterburner it's kind of a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
app it's not afterburner it's kind of a
more<00:00:59.340> simple<00:00:59.789> casual<00:01:00.270> style<00:01:00.600> where<00:01:00.930> there's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
more simple casual style where there's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
more simple casual style where there's
three<00:01:01.320> different<00:01:01.559> modes<00:01:02.000> actual<00:01:03.000> vary<00:01:03.210> in

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
three different modes actual vary in

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
three different modes actual vary in
intensity<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.110> Clarke<00:01:04.409> speed<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
intensity of Clarke speed and then in

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
intensity of Clarke speed and then in
turn<00:01:05.880> heat<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> fan<00:01:06.840> speed<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.140> whatnot<00:01:07.530> just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
turn heat and fan speed and whatnot just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
turn heat and fan speed and whatnot just
to<00:01:08.189> keep<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.490> card<00:01:08.729> cool<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to keep your card cool but then if you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
to keep your card cool but then if you
want<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> awesome

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
want to do something like be a awesome

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
want to do something like be a awesome
spreadsheet<00:01:12.210> man<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.570> don't<00:01:12.720> necessarily

spreadsheet man you don't necessarily
have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.530> graphics<00:01:13.860> card

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
have to have your graphics card

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
have to have your graphics card
massively<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.820> clocks<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.509> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
massively over clocks you can have an in

massively over clocks you can have an in
silent<00:01:16.080> mode<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:16.860> quieter<00:01:17.490> last

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
silent mode will be a lot quieter last

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
silent mode will be a lot quieter last
but<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.390> least<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.780> their<00:01:18.990> Torx<00:01:19.320> fan

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
but not least we have their Torx fan

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.310 
but not least we have their Torx fan
which<00:01:19.920> sports<00:01:20.280> 19<00:01:21.119> percent<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.960> overall

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

airflow going down towards the card 75%

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
airflow going down towards the card 75%
increased<00:01:25.710> structural<00:01:26.159> durability<00:01:26.729> which

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
increased structural durability which

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.429 
increased structural durability which
hopefully<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.479> mean<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> breaks<00:01:28.140> less

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
hopefully will mean that it breaks less

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.749 
hopefully will mean that it breaks less
although<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.979> didn't<00:01:29.189> break<00:01:29.280> much<00:01:29.490> already

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
although they didn't break much already

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
although they didn't break much already
so<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> guess<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.509> good<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> 5%<00:01:31.560> lower

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so I guess that's good and 5% lower

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
so I guess that's good and 5% lower
total<00:01:32.460> noise<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.659> might<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.350> sound

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
total noise which I know might not sound

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.870 
total noise which I know might not sound
like<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.770> ton<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> very

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
like a ton but it's actually a very

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
like a ton but it's actually a very
important<00:01:36.390> metric<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.560> isn't<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
important metric and I know this isn't a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
important metric and I know this isn't a
twin<00:01:38.369> frozer<00:01:38.700> 5<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.900> also<00:01:40.079> wanted<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.380> show

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
twin frozer 5 but I also wanted to show

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
twin frozer 5 but I also wanted to show
off<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> new<00:01:40.799> crate<00:01:41.280> series<00:01:41.700> components<00:01:42.270> they

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
off the new crate series components they

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
off the new crate series components they
have<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> motherboard<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.619> GPU<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
have a motherboard and a GPU in this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
have a motherboard and a GPU in this
line<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> they're<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> cool<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> white

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
line and they're a cool kind of white

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
line and they're a cool kind of white
series<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.220> seeing<00:01:47.430> different<00:01:47.700> colors<00:01:48.060> of

series I like seeing different colors of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
series I like seeing different colors of
boards<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.409> probably<00:01:49.680> help

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
boards and this will probably help

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
boards and this will probably help
