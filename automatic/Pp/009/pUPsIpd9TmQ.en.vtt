actually located at a landfill we take

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
actually located at a landfill we take
the<00:00:24.480> recycle<00:00:25.109> glass<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.250> here

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the recycle glass just like you see here

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.330 
the recycle glass just like you see here
any<00:00:26.820> color<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.539> crush<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.890> then<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.099> actually

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
any color we crush it then we actually

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.089 
any color we crush it then we actually
knew<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.179> into<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.900> consistency<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:31.949> this

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
knew it into this consistency here this

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
knew it into this consistency here this
is<00:00:32.250> ground<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.790> glass<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.660> actually<00:00:33.960> feels

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
is ground up glass it actually feels

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
is ground up glass it actually feels
like<00:00:34.410> baby<00:00:34.829> powder<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.790> fine

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
like baby powder it's that fine

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
like baby powder it's that fine
we<00:00:36.750> had<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> foaming<00:00:37.380> agent<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.309> little

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
we had a foaming agent to it a little

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420 
we had a foaming agent to it a little
bit<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> color<00:00:39.120> goes<00:00:39.690> into<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> kiln<00:00:40.350> 70<00:00:41.280> 80

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
bit of color goes into the kiln 70 80

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.670 
bit of color goes into the kiln 70 80
minutes<00:00:41.760> later<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.210> comes<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.930> gross<00:00:43.350> tone

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
minutes later it comes out as gross tone

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.850 
minutes later it comes out as gross tone
and<00:00:43.969> we<00:00:44.969> actually<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.289> types<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and we actually make two types of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.069 
and we actually make two types of
product<00:00:47.280> both<00:00:47.460> products<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.239> exactly<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
product both products are exactly the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.430 
product both products are exactly the
same

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
same

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
same
we<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.160> crush<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.610> into<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:51.030> sizes<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
we just crush them into two sizes the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
we just crush them into two sizes the
larger<00:00:52.500> size<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.129> mark<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:54.030> alternative

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
larger size we mark it as an alternative

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
larger size we mark it as an alternative
to<00:00:54.750> hydrogen<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.800> hydroponic<00:00:56.430> growing<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to hydrogen for hydroponic growing the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.479 
to hydrogen for hydroponic growing the
smaller<00:00:57.600> size<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.829> mark<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.340> as

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
smaller size you see here we mark it as

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
smaller size you see here we mark it as
an<00:01:00.030> alternative<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> perlite<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.649> would

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
an alternative to perlite so you would

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.759 
an alternative to perlite so you would
use<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.309> aeration<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.390> soil<00:01:03.840> compost

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
use this for aeration in soil compost

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.350 
use this for aeration in soil compost
peat<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:06.450> cocoa<00:01:06.840> pod<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> give<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
peat or cocoa pod so just to give you a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
peat or cocoa pod so just to give you a
little<00:01:09.540> demo<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.500> well<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.189> holds<00:01:11.520> water

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
little demo on how well it holds water

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
little demo on how well it holds water
I'm<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> little<00:01:13.860> bit<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.100> water

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
I'm going to take a little bit of water

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.859 
I'm going to take a little bit of water
here<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:16.220> couple<00:01:17.220> drops<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> most

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
here a couple drops here one of the most

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.590 
here a couple drops here one of the most
common<00:01:19.380> growing<00:01:19.710> media's<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.790> hydroponics<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
common growing media's in hydroponics is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
common growing media's in hydroponics is
something<00:01:21.900> called<00:01:22.080> hydrogen<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.369> lot<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
something called hydrogen which a lot of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.969 
something called hydrogen which a lot of
people<00:01:23.759> thinks<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.390> natural<00:01:24.900> product<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.560> yes

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
people thinks a natural product is yes

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.850 
people thinks a natural product is yes
it's<00:01:26.189> clay<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> also<00:01:27.600> comes<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.200> Germany

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it's clay but it also comes from Germany

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
it's clay but it also comes from Germany
that's<00:01:29.040> where<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> clay<00:01:29.970> from<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that's where you get this clay from it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
that's where you get this clay from it's
heated<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.320> uses<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> energy<00:01:32.850> being

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
heated up uses a lot of energy being

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
heated up uses a lot of energy being
heated<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> shipped<00:01:34.530> halfway

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
heated and then it shipped halfway

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
heated and then it shipped halfway
across<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> world<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:36.119> Germany<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> the

United<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.680> North<00:01:37.860> America<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.360> putting<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.990> in

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
United to North America so putting it in

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.219 
United to North America so putting it in
water<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.460> no<00:01:42.360> water<00:01:42.689> absorption

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
water as you can see no water absorption

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.770 
water as you can see no water absorption
and<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.430> does<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.060> give<00:01:45.299> off<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and all it really does is give off this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.010 
and all it really does is give off this
ugly<00:01:46.229> red<00:01:46.920> clay<00:01:47.369> dust<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.240> lines<00:01:48.750> your

can<00:01:53.850> also<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.320> absorbing<00:01:56.159> any

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
can also see that it's not absorbing any

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.209 
can also see that it's not absorbing any
water<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.920> all<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
water at all but this like that all it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.969 
water at all but this like that all it
does<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.460> give<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> more<00:02:00.000> red<00:02:00.689> clay<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.770> check

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
does is give you more red clay but check

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.390 
does is give you more red clay but check
out<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> gross<00:02:02.610> tone

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
out the gross tone

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.359 
out the gross tone
look<00:02:05.400> at<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.230> rock<00:02:07.560> sponge<00:02:08.070> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
look at that it's like a rock sponge it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.030 
look at that it's like a rock sponge it
just<00:02:08.760> sucks<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> water<00:02:09.600> right<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:10.950> you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
just sucks that water right up when you

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.150 
just sucks that water right up when you
apply<00:02:11.310> water<00:02:11.670> directly<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.050> absorbs<00:02:13.980> it

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
apply water directly to it it absorbs it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.780 
apply water directly to it it absorbs it
so<00:02:14.910> growing<00:02:15.750> hydroponically<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:17.160> hydrogen

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
so growing hydroponically with hydrogen

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.450 
so growing hydroponically with hydrogen
the<00:02:18.240> plants<00:02:18.600> get<00:02:18.780> water<00:02:19.110> for<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> moment<00:02:20.070> then

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
the plants get water for the moment then

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.790 
the plants get water for the moment then
it<00:02:20.670> drains<00:02:21.030> no<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.690> water<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.500> growth

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
it drains no more water with growth

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.550 
it drains no more water with growth
stone<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.340> retains<00:02:23.760> water<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.960> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> have

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
stone it retains water so if you have

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.230 
stone it retains water so if you have
any<00:02:25.830> situation<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> power-down

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
any situation with the power-down

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.060 
any situation with the power-down
problem<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:27.870> your<00:02:27.990> pumps<00:02:28.380> there's<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
problem with your pumps there's going to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.760 
problem with your pumps there's going to
hold<00:02:29.400> water<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.240> you'll<00:02:30.720> actually<00:02:31.020> use<00:02:31.260> less

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
hold water so you'll actually use less

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.620 
hold water so you'll actually use less
water<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:32.340> your<00:02:32.490> systems<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.480> other

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
water in your systems the other

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.380 
water in your systems the other
advantage<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.380> growth<00:02:34.590> stone<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
advantage of growth stone is that the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.320 
advantage of growth stone is that the
edges<00:02:36.870> are<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.590> little<00:02:37.620> bit<00:02:37.980> sharper<00:02:38.880> rougher

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
edges are a little bit sharper rougher

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.120 
edges are a little bit sharper rougher
than<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.780> see<00:02:39.960> in<00:02:39.990> hydrogen<00:02:40.620> which<00:02:41.100> is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
than what you see in hydrogen which is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.370 
than what you see in hydrogen which is
good<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.820> want<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.330> as<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.930> roots<00:02:43.110> grow

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
good you want that as the roots grow

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.370 
good you want that as the roots grow
down<00:02:43.410> they<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.580> hit<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.030> edge<00:02:45.380> split

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
down they actually hit this edge split

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.380 
down they actually hit this edge split
and<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.890> end<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> bigger<00:02:47.760> root<00:02:48.120> mass

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and you end up with a bigger root mass

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.080 
and you end up with a bigger root mass
than<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.930> would<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.530> hydrogen<00:02:50.250> growth

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
than you would with hydrogen growth

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.370 
than you would with hydrogen growth
stone<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.600> reusable<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.740> not<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.160> reusable<00:02:53.850> as

have to use something like hydrogen

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.920 
have to use something like hydrogen
