believe is Red Dead Redemption - we've

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.550 
believe is Red Dead Redemption - we've
also<00:02:41.270> had<00:02:41.570> some<00:02:41.600> hints<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.170> Rockstar

also had some hints that Rockstar
working<00:02:42.980> on<00:02:43.070> Red<00:02:43.220> Dead<00:02:43.370> Redemption<00:02:43.490> -<00:02:43.970> but

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
working on Red Dead Redemption - but

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.790 
working on Red Dead Redemption - but
