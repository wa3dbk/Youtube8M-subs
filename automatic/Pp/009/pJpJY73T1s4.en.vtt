00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.660
 hello guys this is a video outfit a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
 different bit that is different from all 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 others because they were fake spoken it 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.250
 I talk because maybe a little bit 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.619
 more enjoyable in quotes because with 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.179
 the music maybe a little boring and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.710
 maybe I'll explain an act but the data that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.020
 I'll show you better for the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.790
 rewrite that maybe you understand a little bit 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 better even if I'm not good at 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.629
 describe your dog the same is a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.879
 outfit designed for the first day of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 school is quite particular though 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.289
 nice short simple very simple 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.199
 but to this cardigan that practically 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 the particular garment that precisely makes a 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.090
 a little less obvious than a small one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.340
 premise that I do also have 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.949
 worn the shorts because when 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.710
 I went to school I don't know now 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.659
 23 years if he is still so they could 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 quietly wear shorts 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.360
 obviously if you can't wear them 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.100
 shorts at school 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.430
 you can safely replace them with 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 of classic LEDs or with jeans 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.400
 very normal, first of all, he started in 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.680
 the accessories I chose golden 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 these controversies have been sent to me 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.229
 respectively from this ros cross 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 cannes is this here from the bridgestone 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.560
 they have become a reddish coppery type 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.960
 they are fading before they were really 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.579
 golden color, however, I have them 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.009
 chosen the same is this with the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.670
 cross and this with the bear then I have 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.299
 chose to wear this bracelet 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.350
 very classic bronze and then finally this 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.299
 I don't know if it's from this way earring with 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 the little owl I found and that you 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.729
 cali whale and I paid him a euro 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.159
 95 so you ask me in so many and i 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.259
 cuts no longer found there are any more 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.020
 However other hand earrings really 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.240
 beautiful and so I chose this maybe 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 if you do and now and skilfully loose 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.229
 but if you queue up a bun one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.850
 side braid taken back 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.280
 simply pulled this way yes 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.819
 you will see this that you are very fond of but a 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.680
 earring 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.010
 moving on to the under-run I hope myself 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.160
 feel you have chosen a very simple one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.890
 pretty long white vest in 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.250
 way that covers a little bit over 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.930
 hips and I chose to match this 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.780
 I show this necklace 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.700
 cute little chocolate falls into one 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.209
 bead a key is a little rose 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.769
 cream color so simple for 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.030
 embellish a moment since the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.600
 canottierina is very much indeed 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.970
 simple and then I chose this cardigan 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.840
 which is the strong point of the fit 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.110
 practically it is of very light fabric 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.790
 sim and chiffon in this non-buttoned 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.370
 so it remains open but then anyway 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.380
 you can also choose to put one 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.570
 belt and highlight the point here 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.209
 life and asymmetrical and that makes it so 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.790
 that you fall a little bit then face 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.090
 very fluttering very asymmetrical e 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 precisely it ends with these two points 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.209
 just behind it is shorter I don't know if 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.019
 you see half way ahead is a lot 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.000
 much more he 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.549
 another very nice thing about this one 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
 this garment are the sleeves that have a 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.900
 color as you see totally different 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.609
 compared to the rest of the cardigan e 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.480
 I'm a blue night it's really a lot 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.459
 beautiful 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.620
 it is not my short sleeve it has three quarters 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.109
 nor long-sleeved, however, it arrives precisely at 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.060
 this height is here from the particularity 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.269
 to have this little twist with 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.340
 with white lace obviously a lot 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.010
 very nice maybe I even had 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.190
 thought you could wear this 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.530
 head with a vest underneath maybe 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.410
 the lace obviously covering and therefore 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.730
 make the fit slightly more elegant 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.620
 if maybe you have this kind of 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.840
 below instead chosen to put gods 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.950
 however, they are very simple georges 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.459
 details because they have an effect 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.440
 gradient as you see here are a bit 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.319
 frayed while here they have a series 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.019
 of silver colored studs 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.760
 combine well to the short metal 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.410
 of the necklace chain 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.510
 naturally as I told you in the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.760
 premessa you can replace them with gods 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.010
 leggings by naturally putting one 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.680
 magliettina longer so opaque 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.710
 or with classic jeans like 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.400
 instead I chose to wear 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.889
 these jeans- colored low top sneakers for 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.680
 to take a little bit at least is the color 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.169
 of cardigan sleeves I know a 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.900
 rather atypical combination no 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.810
 a little bit particular but you know that I 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.639
 I have a style exactly like this 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.280
 like to combine so a little different 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.650
 among them then I know can like it with a little 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.310
 more obviously I also thought of one 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.320
 to an alternative in fact because he knows that 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.180
 not really liked the sneakers can 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.039
 quietly I intend to stay for 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.950
 example a pair of white dancers 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.139
 or simply another model of 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.300
 sneakers though I don't know 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.280
 totally white or resumed 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.590
 however the style slightly more 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.930
 elegant cardigan so this 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.220
 they were fit that I thought 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.750
 obviously I know it's not an outfit 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.880
 portable from everyone that reflects the tastes 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.760
 of all, however, I wanted to give a moment 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.770
 a slightly more different alternative 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.420
 here from the classic f.to play more 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.270
 basic let me know 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.920
 prefer the videos of it in this case 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.290
 speak or always with music 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.180
 so how I did it as I did them 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.400
 I always hope this video is there 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.990
 liked thank you that I feel you a 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.370
 kiss sweetie go see her 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.590
 trick because it really is really 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.150
 good and I send you a kiss that we see 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.150
