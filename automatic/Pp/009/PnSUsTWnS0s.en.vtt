00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
gun it's just like a nerf gun and see

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.200 
gun it's just like a nerf gun and see
it's<00:00:10.950> just<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.460> Lego<00:00:12.650> Holly<00:00:13.849> I've<00:00:14.849> no<00:00:15.150> idea

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
it's just like Lego Holly I've no idea

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.000 
it's just like Lego Holly I've no idea
what<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.960> my<00:00:16.139> uncle<00:00:16.529> folly<00:00:16.830> or

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
what that like my uncle folly or

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.740 
what that like my uncle folly or
something<00:00:17.460> I've<00:00:17.609> no<00:00:18.029> idea<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
something I've no idea really what that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.490 
something I've no idea really what that
means<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.859> guess<00:00:20.220> that's<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.580> name<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
means but I guess that's the name of the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000 
means but I guess that's the name of the
elbow<00:00:22.500> bionicle<00:00:23.990> if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.769> leave<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
elbow bionicle if you know just leave a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.359 
elbow bionicle if you know just leave a
comment<00:00:26.430> telling<00:00:26.490> me<00:00:27.260> it's<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.010> easy<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
comment telling me it's not that easy to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.080 
comment telling me it's not that easy to
 the<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.029> super<00:00:30.359> heart<00:00:31.489> it's<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.910> what

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
 the not super heart it's not what

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.819 
 the not super heart it's not what
it's<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.750> easy<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> nite<00:00:34.530> finder

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's not as easy as the nite finder

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.030 
it's not as easy as the nite finder
pretty<00:00:35.399> much

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
pretty much

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
pretty much
and<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.690> darts<00:00:37.990> it<00:00:38.140> uses

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and the darts it uses

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.520 
and the darts it uses
look<00:00:40.019> like<00:00:40.199> this

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.000 

and<00:00:43.010> they're<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.309> little<00:00:44.110> smaller<00:00:45.110> just<00:00:45.890> a

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
and they're a little smaller just a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.460 
and they're a little smaller just a
little<00:00:46.280> though<00:00:46.430> if<00:00:47.120> I

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
little though if I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.880 
little though if I
then<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:49.010> my<00:00:49.160> clothes<00:00:49.990> so<00:00:50.990> there's<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.710> edge

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
then the my clothes so there's the edge

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.250 
then the my clothes so there's the edge
meet<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
meet you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.530 
meet you
and<00:00:54.379> little<00:00:54.920> small<00:00:55.219> now

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
and little small now

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.070 
and little small now
both<00:00:58.110> both<00:00:58.830> both<00:00:59.130> work<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.490> either<00:00:59.760> gone

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
both both both work in either gone

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.590 
both both both work in either gone
doesn't<00:01:01.080> matter<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.820> will<00:01:03.060> be<00:01:03.180> testing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
doesn't matter but I will be testing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.760 
doesn't matter but I will be testing
this<00:01:03.690> out

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.800 

so<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.609> the<00:01:08.030> weird<00:01:08.149> thing<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.509> when<00:01:08.719> you

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
so and the weird thing is that when you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.490 
so and the weird thing is that when you
crack<00:01:09.109> it<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.560> when<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.479> barrel<00:01:11.479> turns

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.170 

if<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:15.800> again<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.280> case<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.490> guys<00:01:16.730> didn't<00:01:17.060> see

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
if you again in case you guys didn't see

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
if you again in case you guys didn't see
that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.910 

so<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.479> pretty<00:01:21.659> weird<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.649> pull<00:01:22.829> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so that's pretty weird can you pull the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.620 
so that's pretty weird can you pull the
trigger<00:01:24.229> doesn't<00:01:25.229> rotate

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.429 

a<00:01:28.689> little<00:01:29.439> weird<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.700> i<00:01:30.729> will<00:01:31.299> be<00:01:31.600> doing<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.259> test

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
a little weird so i will be doing a test

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
a little weird so i will be doing a test
lab<00:01:32.710> just<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.159> normal<00:01:33.340> gun<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.939> all<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.119> bullet

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
lab just a normal gun and all the bullet

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280 
lab just a normal gun and all the bullet
comical<00:01:37.420> bullet

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.280 

I<00:01:41.410> went<00:01:42.070> relatively<00:01:42.550> good<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.990> was<00:01:44.110> just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
I went relatively good that was just

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.390 
I went relatively good that was just
flat<00:01:45.870> hit<00:01:46.870> off<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:47.980> of<00:01:48.070> those<00:01:48.220> two

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
flat hit off that one of those two

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.650 
flat hit off that one of those two
stairs<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:48.820> bouncing<00:01:49.660> there<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:52.600> a

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
stairs and bouncing there so I was a

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.450 
stairs and bouncing there so I was a
pretty<00:01:52.870> good<00:01:52.960> one<00:01:53.080> now<00:01:53.770> I'll<00:01:53.890> try<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> gun

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
pretty good one now I'll try the gun

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.880 
pretty good one now I'll try the gun
with<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.700> micro<00:01:55.240> Sol<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:59.350> got<00:01:59.620> it<00:01:59.740> done

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
with the micro Sol see well got it done

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:11.370 
with the micro Sol see well got it done
let's<00:02:00.310> go<00:02:00.640> back<00:02:00.850> over<00:02:02.580> okay<00:02:04.830> let's<00:02:05.830> see<00:02:06.160> here

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.540 

sticking<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:12.010> my<00:02:12.130> girl<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.550> there

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.630 

kind<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.240> hard<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.510> stick<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.990> there<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:17.640> work

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
kind of hard to stick in there but work

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.330 
kind of hard to stick in there but work
well<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> wall<00:02:19.840> now<00:02:20.530> these<00:02:20.680> don't<00:02:20.950> work<00:02:21.040> as

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
well to the wall now these don't work as

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.110 
well to the wall now these don't work as
well<00:02:22.380> sometimes<00:02:23.550> kind<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.640> depends<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
well sometimes kind of depends on the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.870 
well sometimes kind of depends on the
bullet<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.710> didn't<00:02:27.010> even<00:02:27.190> test<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.580> bolt

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
bullet but I didn't even test this bolt

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.280 
bullet but I didn't even test this bolt
so<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> might<00:02:28.330> not<00:02:28.360> shoot<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.870> well<00:02:29.020> might

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
so it might not shoot that well might

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.899 
so it might not shoot that well might
shoot<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:29.710> well

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.509 

actually<00:02:37.909> that<00:02:38.030> shot<00:02:38.299> like<00:02:39.099> better<00:02:40.099> than<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
actually that shot like better than the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.629 
actually that shot like better than the
normal<00:02:40.819> bullet<00:02:41.239> oh<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:42.769> kind<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.069> just<00:02:43.249> depends

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
normal bullet oh it kind of just depends

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.220 
normal bullet oh it kind of just depends
on<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.819> bullet<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.290> bounced<00:02:45.680> off<00:02:45.799> like

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
on the bullet see it bounced off like

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.979 
on the bullet see it bounced off like
one<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.260> those<00:02:48.409> three<00:02:48.950> stairs<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.989> right

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
one of those three stairs like right

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.050
