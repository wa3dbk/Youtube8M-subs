00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.070
 What's up kids? Nothing here 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.420
 you're a little quiet because I wanted to 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.289
 show you how the pathos asks me 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.460
 always eat 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.050
 always good is hungry is taught 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.899
 from the other family that had to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.579
 have it the first ones who took care of it and 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.199
 should have a positive reinforcement that 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.930
 when he overturned the glass they gave him 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.480
 I'm eating I keep them flix 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.980
 doing the same positive reinforcement and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.780
 every time you cut the glass 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.000
 I give a little bit of food so always 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.550
 that is hungry that is usually almost 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.460
 always hit the glass 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.000
 so here you have it 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.490
 to the epp to your 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.810
 and most therefore already you see very well 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.130
 true that the good sailor is very good 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.310
 for eivissa something saw that he is eating 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.320
 from the seaweed wall 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.700
 that for the one who says how in a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200
 principle that governments 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.250
 the swim bladder worked 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.250
 see it perfectly yes 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.730
 and nothing as a novelty because the first 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.380
 from the lawn as I call him I already know 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.290
 has expanded above the tab 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.909
 up through an area of the rock and what 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.039
 you can see from this area here 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.590
 and then a new coral that I would like 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.030
 see when it grows that you can see it there 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.270
 it's also quite interesting that 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.979
 coral to see when it grows now 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.970
 I'm going to upload after this a video 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the prawns 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.040
 that I have already started with the theme of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 prawns so be vigilant now that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.920
 I'm going to upload another 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.930
 As you can see the sea as still 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.830
 problems 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.150
 nothing has died, everything is growing well 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.970
 remember those we choose to fix 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.250
 it's so perfect the bases even is 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.350
 the coral already starting over 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.720
 grow above the bases that I made 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.760
 I 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.760
 this is the same and nothing all very well 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.240
 so I'm going to feed the status 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.240
 now I upload the video of the prawns
