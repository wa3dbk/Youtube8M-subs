00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
played with this gun before I've just

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419 
played with this gun before I've just
used<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.870> little<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.230> little<00:00:10.500> bit<00:00:10.710> yesterday<00:00:10.950> but

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
used a little a little bit yesterday but

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.089 
used a little a little bit yesterday but
today<00:00:12.120> I've<00:00:12.240> like<00:00:12.660> properly<00:00:13.349> customized<00:00:13.889> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
today I've like properly customized it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.670 
today I've like properly customized it
and<00:00:14.280> everything<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.109> let's<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.529> this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and everything so let's see how this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.890 
and everything so let's see how this
goes

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
goes

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.380 
goes
it's<00:00:18.900> similar<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> heavy<00:00:20.670> assault<00:00:20.939> rifle

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it's similar to the heavy assault rifle

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.790 
it's similar to the heavy assault rifle
but<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.279> has<00:00:23.490> better<00:00:23.820> damage<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
but I think that has better damage and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.490 
but I think that has better damage and
that<00:00:25.800> also<00:00:26.160> has<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> bit<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> fire<00:00:27.000> rate<00:00:27.500> okay

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that also has a bit of fire rate okay

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
that also has a bit of fire rate okay
