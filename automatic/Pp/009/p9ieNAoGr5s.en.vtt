00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
substrate this is just eco complete you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
substrate this is just eco complete you
could<00:01:18.119> complete<00:01:19.759> just<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:20.939> opinion<00:01:22.159> takes<00:01:23.159> a

that in HD I was shocked at how much

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.940 
that in HD I was shocked at how much
dirt<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.119> tank<00:02:06.680> that's<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
dirt was in my tank that's one of the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.309 
dirt was in my tank that's one of the
challenges<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
challenges I think when you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.830 
challenges I think when you
have<00:02:09.439> you<00:02:10.429> have<00:02:10.579> this<00:02:10.729> much<00:02:10.969> stuff<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:11.629> you<00:02:11.689> do

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
have you have this much stuff and you do

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.780 
have you have this much stuff and you do
the<00:02:11.959> live<00:02:12.140> dirt<00:02:12.439> tends<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.099> kick<00:02:13.280> off<00:02:13.459> when<00:02:13.700> you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the live dirt tends to kick off when you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.179 
the live dirt tends to kick off when you

stuff when you when you get high flow
with<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.169> fx5<00:03:06.709> that's<00:03:07.579> just<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:07.939> to<00:03:08.030> kick

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
with the fx5 that's just going to kick

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.500 
with the fx5 that's just going to kick
up<00:03:08.359> some<00:03:08.569> haze<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:10.060> that'll<00:03:11.060> be<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.269> stuff

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
up some haze so that'll be the stuff

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.920 
up some haze so that'll be the stuff
first<00:03:11.989> up<00:03:12.199> it<00:03:12.790> clogs<00:03:13.790> up<00:03:14.000> my<00:03:14.120> new<00:03:14.239> filters<00:03:14.659> but

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
first up it clogs up my new filters but

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.539 
first up it clogs up my new filters but
I'm<00:03:15.169> really<00:03:15.349> trying<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.739> focus<00:03:15.919> on<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> way<00:03:16.489> to

I'm really trying to focus on a way to
get<00:03:16.849> crystal<00:03:17.840> clear<00:03:18.079> water<00:03:18.759> I<00:03:19.759> know<00:03:20.180> some

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
get crystal clear water I know some

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.909 
get crystal clear water I know some
people<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.750> actually<00:03:21.019> use<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.620> marineland

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
people that actually use the marineland

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.759 
people that actually use the marineland
the<00:03:22.549> canister<00:03:23.359> Marineland<00:03:23.900> it's<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.319> micron

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
the canister Marineland it's the micron

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.199 
the canister Marineland it's the micron
or<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.069> can't<00:03:25.400> remember<00:03:25.519> what<00:03:25.729> it's<00:03:25.849> called<00:03:25.879> but

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
or I can't remember what it's called but

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.360 
or I can't remember what it's called but
I<00:03:26.509> used<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.500> knew<00:03:27.620> I'm<00:03:27.739> fish<00:03:27.919> store<00:03:28.129> that<00:03:28.280> had

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
I used to I knew I'm fish store that had

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.789 
I used to I knew I'm fish store that had
one<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.639> those<00:03:28.759> and<00:03:29.199> whenever<00:03:30.199> they<00:03:30.439> set<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.709> a

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
one of those and whenever they set up a

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.199 
one of those and whenever they set up a
new<00:03:30.949> tank<00:03:31.220> they<00:03:31.400> let<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:31.669> run<00:03:31.849> for<00:03:31.879> a<00:03:32.090> while

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
new tank they let it run for a while

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.929 
new tank they let it run for a while
because<00:03:32.449> the<00:03:32.900> filter<00:03:33.889> on<00:03:34.009> it's<00:03:34.159> so<00:03:34.310> fine<00:03:34.609> that

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
because the filter on it's so fine that

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.319 
because the filter on it's so fine that
it<00:03:35.359> would<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:37.400> pull<00:03:37.609> everything<00:03:37.849> right<00:03:38.150> out

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
it would just pull everything right out

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.369 
it would just pull everything right out
so<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:39.379> may<00:03:40.250> end<00:03:40.430> up<00:03:40.579> getting<00:03:40.819> one<00:03:40.939> of<00:03:40.970> those

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
so I may end up getting one of those

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.949 
so I may end up getting one of those
just<00:03:42.379> to<00:03:42.590> help<00:03:43.370> keep<00:03:43.639> this<00:03:43.879> thing<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.479> crystal

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
just to help keep this thing a crystal

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.499 
just to help keep this thing a crystal
clear<00:03:45.229> to<00:03:45.739> run<00:03:45.859> it<00:03:46.009> every<00:03:46.099> now<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.579> then<00:03:46.669> and

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.800 
clear to run it every now and then and
i'm<00:03:47.659> already<00:03:47.840> liking<00:03:48.199> the<00:03:48.439> fx5<00:03:49.069> with<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
i'm already liking the fx5 with the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.559 
i'm already liking the fx5 with the
plants<00:03:51.169> trimmed<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.949> doesn't<00:03:52.370> look<00:03:52.459> like<00:03:52.569> an

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569
