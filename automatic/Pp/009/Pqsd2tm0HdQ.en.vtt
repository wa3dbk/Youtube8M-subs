00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
that's why we we had this

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.710 
that's why we we had this
stratasys<00:01:27.220> 3d<00:01:27.670> printing<00:01:28.030> machine<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.630> we

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
stratasys 3d printing machine and we

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.630 
stratasys 3d printing machine and we
thought<00:01:28.930> well<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.590> could<00:01:29.770> print<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.219> out<00:01:30.310> for

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
thought well we could print it out for

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.910 
thought well we could print it out for
her<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.119> he<00:01:31.539> did<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.710> weight

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
her and he did it and the weight

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.279 
her and he did it and the weight
difference<00:01:33.219> is<00:01:33.670> significant<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.869> for<00:01:35.259> a

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
difference is significant and for a

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.529 
difference is significant and for a
child<00:01:35.530> who<00:01:35.710> only<00:01:35.740> weighs<00:01:36.070> 25<00:01:36.579> pounds<00:01:36.609> it<00:01:37.299> makes

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
child who only weighs 25 pounds it makes

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:38.429 
child who only weighs 25 pounds it makes
a<00:01:37.689> big<00:01:37.840> difference

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
a big difference

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.590 
a big difference

this<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.030> those<00:02:09.530> industries<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
this is one of those industries that

additive manufacturing because we need

I<00:02:18.270> think<00:02:18.690> 3d<00:02:19.170> scanning<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.400> printing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
I think 3d scanning and printing

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
I think 3d scanning and printing

we would go upstairs and we would say
Emma<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:03.170> know<00:03:03.290> we're<00:03:03.560> gonna<00:03:03.710> put<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.070> racks

and everyone in the room cried we took

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.470 
and everyone in the room cried we took
it<00:03:09.920> off<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.190> her<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.460> this<00:03:10.580> one<00:03:10.760> occasion<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
it off of her on this one occasion to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.930 
it off of her on this one occasion to
make<00:03:11.840> some<00:03:11.990> adjustments<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:13.190> as<00:03:13.670> we

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
make some adjustments to it and as we

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.390 
make some adjustments to it and as we
took<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.210> off<00:03:14.360> she<00:03:14.750> cried<00:03:15.230> out<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.680> want<00:03:16.190> that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
took it off she cried out I want that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.540 
took it off she cried out I want that
and<00:03:17.360> we<00:03:18.230> didn't<00:03:18.470> think<00:03:18.650> all<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:19.040> much<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.400> it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
and we didn't think all that much of it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.660 
and we didn't think all that much of it
but<00:03:20.000> when<00:03:20.660> mom<00:03:21.110> started<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.530> cry<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:24.580> when<00:03:25.580> we

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
but when mom started to cry and when we

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.280 
but when mom started to cry and when we
look<00:03:25.820> over<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.150> asked<00:03:26.390> mom<00:03:26.720> why<00:03:26.900> she's<00:03:27.110> crying

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and she kind of takes a moment to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.690 
and she kind of takes a moment to
recompose<00:03:30.380> herself<00:03:30.740> and<00:03:30.860> tell<00:03:31.130> us<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.310> that
