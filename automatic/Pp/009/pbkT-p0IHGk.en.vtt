 I read during the marathon will have even 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.650
 is a national author who is very cool 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.850
 without having already heard about bulgaria 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 What is a science fiction book? 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.519
 explained national new height right there 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.640
 Anyway, I was very excited because 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.859
 I already love science fiction and I'm 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 trying to read more national authors in the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 recent times and I have liked 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
 I quite like to support the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.700
 authors and this book in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.149
 especially so it conquered me profoundly 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 Before I love science fiction people and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.010
 In this book the author used it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.829
 all possible resources and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 imaginable grandson you can imagine right? 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.110
 he was able to put it in that book 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.460
 elements of science fiction as 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.910
 space travel 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.010
 finally creatures other planets and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 discovery of other creatures of life 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.369
 intelligent off the ground right of 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.860
 extraterrestrials 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.380
 all this kind of thing here and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.720
 involves science fiction is all together 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.850
 With that book, you know, he got it. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.640
 use all its elements right? 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.439
 without getting too messy and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.290
 got to put everything in order 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.600
 perfectly then everything fits know 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 and that's what this book ended up 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.270
 winning because he was able to build 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.360
 a very complex narrative also full 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 of elements, even the book does not 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.530
 it was confused it was not that way 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.840
 loose left no loose ends 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.119
 so that was what I liked most that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.149
 in this reading the story then happens 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 neither 2009 actually begins in 2009 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.680
 when the amanda that our protagonist 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.140
 that she is as young as she is without 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 want in her father's lab and she 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.369
 begins to see different things 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.860
 happening, she suspects 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.690
 thing and she goes there to see and she actually 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 contacted a 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.270
 invention of her father who is a scientist is 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.490
 famous for such renowned 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 He's the usual guy since childhood. 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.930
 he makes technological gadgets right? 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.240
 she faces something with this object 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.880
 strange and runs off running 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.250
 kill with that, it's since when 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.690
 happened this episode is consider everything 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.810
 started to change everything started like this 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.960
 shuffle in her life and she even 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.960
 in the present moment of the book in the 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.260
 she is in a coma and then she 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.050
 wake up from coma she had meningitis 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.560
 acute and long as very long 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.750
 and when she woke up she had a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.990
 I dream a thing so much a traveler 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.680
 place that so did not seem to be on earth 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.440
 a perfect place, I never imagined 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.140
 she tells of six of her patients' rape 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.460
 was esp until she graduated in eighth 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.580
 worked with a psychiatrist before 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.080
 get in the car and she finds 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.590
 those patients who became 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.950
 her friends right which is the strike and replay 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.380
 and they have a friend too that the lina 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.230
 then these three colleagues join 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.320
 Amanda and will try to understand this dream. 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.120
 and everything else that starts to happen 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.380
 amanda's father he's a guy 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.340
 extremely powerful and ambitious then 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.150
 he as a scientist is an inventor and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.610
 everything else 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 he is always trying to invent things 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.810
 increasingly dangerous and that each 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.269
 more power for him 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.310
 and in this he is inventing things every 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.380
 more dangerous things 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.700
 risks that endanger the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.680
 own planet earth 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.180
 amanda after she left the coma and 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.489
 met with friends she starts to 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 turn things on do not you? 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.780
 the pieces of the puzzle connect the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.330
 dots and she touches herself that the father 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.190
 a risk community even and she 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.500
 begins to understand what he is planning 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.989
 that something quite astonishing 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.680
 Well, another explains it very well here. 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.719
 do not let 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.629
 let go of things from then on 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:13.260
 increasingly complicated and the four 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.840
 friends begin to feel they have a plot 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.229
 much bigger rolling so something very 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.910
 more dangerous and worse is happening to 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.699
 around them and they are being 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.320
 persecuted then so frenzied know 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.880
 are being persecuted they are 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.470
 realizing that something very dangerous is 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.320
 to happen much worse than they 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.410
 imagined and amanda and his friends they 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.660
 They will try to venture and try. 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.940
 to prevent oswald who is the father of amanda 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.430
 to do what you're up to 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.979
 it's very sinister people are very 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.050
 mystery together and up to the last 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.910
 chapters and the last pages of the book 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.820
 everything can still change and everything changes 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.530
 fact and what is surprising and there is much worse 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.800
 of what you imagined you know what 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.020
 It happens is much more mysterious and you 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.389
 leaves a lot more of a fallen chin than 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.250
 the whole story so I know guy 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.759
 I loved this book, I really loved it. 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.800
 So I took the story and so he did not 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.750
 will have such height rest and will get you 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.580
 100 each chapter is a business 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.979
 His writing going on is very good. 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.289
 very delicious to read 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.260
 the dialogues are very cool so they 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.820
 They make sense and friendship between these 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.250
 four characters is very cool 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.349
 especially of the mandarin that they are 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.870
 identify many indicate I found 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.720
 very cool, I really liked these 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.639
 two characters like that and I found the 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.460
 including that the book deserved 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.680
 continuation, but then be part of a 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.240
 series even I even mentioned it in 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.430
 a written post that is rolling there in my 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.009
 blog with a draw, enjoy 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.169
 I started there until I think the 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.509
 book could be divided into one knows 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.370
 a technology 100 and then suddenly 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.889
 work these characters even more 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.030
 more calm because the rhythm of the book 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.949
 so frenetic 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.930
 then maybe you could have worked with 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.280
 more calm and work a few books at 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.669
 same story because this story 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.190
 very rich, she accepted a lot so I 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.919
 I tried and really the author is very 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.599
 talented he has this ability so 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:14.300
 to invent worlds in fantastic things 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.599
 What a face, I admire it a lot 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.030
 So, congratulations, you're frank with you. 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.810
 fact invented that the universe a bank 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.970
 different 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.530
 so I love walking around a lot 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.810
 For you, this is a very read. 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.090
 and I think we have to 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.629
 even support our national authors 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.509
 there because the disclosure depends on us 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.889
 It's unfortunately not as well publicized as 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.949
 how much should 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.870
 but let's try and help a little bit 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.569
 that is to promote this work as 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.220
 beautiful so rich that have been ours 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.500
 national authors so this is it folks 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.240
