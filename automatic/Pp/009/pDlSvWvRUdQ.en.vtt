 70,000 years ago the level of the waters

 the separation between Africa and

 Scientists believe that everyone 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.809

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.580

 we should be in the middle of summer but 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.360
 the plants are frozen and the rivers

 ice age 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.520
 glaciers as tall as skyscrapers 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.430
