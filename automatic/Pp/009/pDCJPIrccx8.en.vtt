00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.670 
would be for instance if I said on the
rock<00:02:17.380> genre<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.460> style<00:02:19.030> 1<00:02:19.660> thinking<00:02:20.500> that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
rock genre and style 1 thinking that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.310 
rock genre and style 1 thinking that
that<00:02:20.860> would<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> simplest<00:02:21.730> style<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:23.230> I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
that would be the simplest style and I

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620 
that would be the simplest style and I
play<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> chord<00:02:24.130> progression<00:02:24.700> jiù<00:02:25.000> jiù<00:02:25.180> jiù<00:02:25.420> jiù

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
play a chord progression jiù jiù jiù jiù

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.870 
play a chord progression jiù jiù jiù jiù
jiù<00:02:25.870> jiù<00:02:26.050> jiù<00:02:26.290> jiù<00:02:26.500> jiù<00:02:26.710> jiù<00:02:26.890> jiù<00:02:27.070> jiù<00:02:27.280> jiù<00:02:27.700> jiù

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.990 
jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù
like<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> Ramones<00:02:28.780> type<00:02:29.170> style<00:02:29.730> sometimes<00:02:30.730> it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
like a Ramones type style sometimes it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.640 
like a Ramones type style sometimes it
comes<00:02:31.180> out<00:02:31.330> thinking<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.020> be<00:02:32.290> like

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
comes out thinking I want to be like

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.700 
comes out thinking I want to be like
Mars<00:02:32.920> Volta<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.090> with<00:02:34.360> double<00:02:35.200> kick<00:02:35.380> drums

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
Mars Volta and with double kick drums

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.840 
Mars Volta and with double kick drums
and<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.810> funky<00:02:37.810> slap<00:02:38.530> bass<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.490> I<00:02:39.550> think

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
and all this funky slap bass so I think

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.340 
and all this funky slap bass so I think
what<00:02:40.000> happens<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> listen<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.960> your<00:02:41.080> chord

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
what happens is I listen to your chord

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.040 
what happens is I listen to your chord
progression<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.070> then<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:42.820> assumes<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
progression and then it just assumes the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.220 
progression and then it just assumes the
style<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:45.280> want<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.580> play<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.720> could<00:02:46.960> jump

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
style you want to play so it could jump

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.120 
style you want to play so it could jump
to<00:02:47.320> set<00:02:48.040> style<00:02:48.460> 12<00:02:48.940> or<00:02:49.300> 11<00:02:49.870> when<00:02:50.710> you<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:51.010> it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
to set style 12 or 11 when you have it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.700 
to set style 12 or 11 when you have it
on<00:02:51.250> one<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:52.360> you're<00:02:52.510> thinking<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:53.020> just<00:02:53.050> want<00:02:53.500> a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
on one and you're thinking I just want a

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.000 
on one and you're thinking I just want a
simple<00:02:54.300> 4/4<00:02:55.300> beat<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> have<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.860> do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
simple 4/4 beat so what you have to do

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.070 
simple 4/4 beat so what you have to do
is<00:02:57.160> play<00:02:57.400> really<00:02:57.730> simple<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> put<00:02:58.930> your

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
is play really simple when you put your

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.340 
is play really simple when you put your
chord<00:02:59.410> progression<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.700> teach<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.630> pedal

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
chord progression to teach the pedal

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.620 
chord progression to teach the pedal
I'll<00:03:02.710> demonstrate<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.030> yes<00:03:04.240> again

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
if you really hate playing with

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.580

other people or you're antisocial or you

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.550 
other people or you're antisocial or you
hate<00:03:11.800> your<00:03:11.920> bandmates<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.660> probably

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
hate your bandmates this is probably

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.430 
hate your bandmates this is probably
something<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.100> try<00:03:15.370> out<00:03:15.550> it's<00:03:16.540> not<00:03:16.720> perfect

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
something to try out it's not perfect

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.380 
something to try out it's not perfect
it's<00:03:17.980> stupid<00:03:18.670> sometimes

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
it's stupid sometimes

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.570 
it's stupid sometimes
it<00:03:19.660> doesn't<00:03:20.230> know<00:03:20.350> what<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.830> want<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.160> play

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
it doesn't know what you want to play

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.360 
it doesn't know what you want to play
just<00:03:22.209> like<00:03:22.420> real<00:03:22.810> BAM<00:03:23.110> eights<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:24.160> it's

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
just like real BAM eights but it's

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.580 
just like real BAM eights but it's
better<00:03:24.610> than<00:03:24.880> playing<00:03:25.300> with<00:03:25.480> real<00:03:25.630> people<00:03:25.930> so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
better than playing with real people so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.530 
better than playing with real people so
on<00:03:26.830> this<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:27.490> hard<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.209> on<00:03:28.330> this<00:03:28.420> guitar

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
on this it's hard so on this guitar

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.110 
on this it's hard so on this guitar
pedal<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.440> has<00:03:29.620> built-in<00:03:30.220> guitar<00:03:30.880> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
pedal it has built-in guitar and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.620 

and<00:03:41.080> they<00:03:41.170> have<00:03:41.320> won<00:03:41.560> two<00:03:42.550> different<00:03:43.480> sounds

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
and they have won two different sounds

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.140 
and they have won two different sounds
for<00:03:44.080> genre<00:03:44.470> or<00:03:44.620> three<00:03:45.010> if<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.340> consider<00:03:45.730> the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
for genre or three if you consider the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.660 
for genre or three if you consider the
off<00:03:46.450> position<00:03:49.500> it's<00:03:50.500> actually<00:03:51.130> two<00:03:51.370> different

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
off position it's actually two different

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.290 
off position it's actually two different
sounds

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
sounds

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:17.979
