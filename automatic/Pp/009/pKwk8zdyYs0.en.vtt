00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.590 
much looking like it was going to be the
consensus<00:01:31.710> favorite<00:01:32.520> until<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> Florida

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
consensus favorite until the Florida

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
consensus favorite until the Florida
Derby<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.140> he<00:01:34.350> had<00:01:34.439> kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> troubled<00:01:35.220> trip

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
Derby and he had kind of a troubled trip

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920 
Derby and he had kind of a troubled trip
which<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.360> closed<00:01:36.659> pretty

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
which and then but then closed pretty

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.390 
which and then but then closed pretty
well<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.290> might<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.680> bode<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.009> for

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
well which might actually bode well for

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
well which might actually bode well for
this<00:01:38.520> race<00:01:39.020> union<00:01:40.020> rags<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> think

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
this race union rags what do you think

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
this race union rags what do you think
of<00:01:40.680> him<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> favorite<00:01:41.310> yeah<00:01:41.850> again<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of him as a favorite yeah again I I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
of him as a favorite yeah again I I
don't<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.829> worth<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> low<00:01:44.460> odds

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
don't think it's it's worth the low odds

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
don't think it's it's worth the low odds
to<00:01:45.060> find<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.630> union<00:01:45.990> rags<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.619> bounce

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to find out if union rags can bounce

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.999 
to find out if union rags can bounce
back<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> could<00:01:48.810> easily<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.229> union

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
back here right I could easily see union

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.149 
back here right I could easily see union
rags<00:01:50.220> finishing<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> money<00:01:52.070> when<00:01:53.070> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
rags finishing out of the money when you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
rags finishing out of the money when you
think<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> competition<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:55.020> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
which is one of these maybe headcase

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.389 
which is one of these maybe headcase
words<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.680> coming<00:02:04.890> from<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> west<00:02:05.280> coast

creative<00:02:05.880> cause<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.299> those<00:02:06.420> horses<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
creative cause one of those horses that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.320 
creative cause one of those horses that
is<00:02:07.409> always<00:02:07.860> very<00:02:08.129> close<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.729> seem<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
hard time winning and then there's a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.970 
hard time winning and then there's a
gemologist<00:02:11.520> which<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.599> know

undefeated horse and might be a little
bit<00:02:14.420> overvalued<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.860> reason<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
bit overvalued for that reason so if you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.850 
creative cause okay I looked at both of
those<00:02:28.730> horses<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> lot<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.750> went<00:02:30.440> against

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
those horses a lot I went against

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.670 
those horses a lot I went against
gemologist<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.849> wood<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:33.140> course<00:02:33.379> I<00:02:33.500> got

gemologist in the wood of course I got
burned<00:02:33.950> there<00:02:34.280> but<00:02:35.470> creative<00:02:36.470> cause<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.980> think

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
burned there but creative cause I think

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.250 
burned there but creative cause I think
is<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.519> have<00:02:37.700> more<00:02:37.970> value<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.510> take<00:02:38.900> here

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
is going to have more value to take here
