00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.730
 I have a simple biscuit recipe 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 I'll tell you 4 eggs I'm fine 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.869
 there is a glass of flour knead so dough 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.090
 simple biscuit I have already done 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:37.879
 I cleaned the apples and cut them into slices 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 on thin took a baking sheet form 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:54.770

 Now our biscuit neatly 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:11.630
 lay out our form 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.020
 so that it is distributed completely throughout 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.869
 I have already turned on the surface under the oven 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.570
 180 degrees it warms up and so 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.100

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.970
 nice and put in the oven heated to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.090
