00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.990
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.930
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.240
 game lego the lord of the rings' and 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.060
 We are with a new unlocking 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.460
 red lego bricks 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.430
 guys so we have to go into 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.920
 our map 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.430
 there is 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.160
 and let's go to the swamp of the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.279
 killed by the interrogation that we have 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.279
 there 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.990
 so we go there 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.829
 good and we are here again 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.330
 well I will enter again for 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.330
 select the destination 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.290
 although I had selected it before 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.450
 but I'm going to do it again 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.410
 It's worth it now if we do not have the path of 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.540
 coins 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.540
 and we just have to follow it 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.460
 to the general little by little we go 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.810
 approaching 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 and we have to go far indicates 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.299
 the red indicator this I have there in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.180
 the upper part of the screen is worth 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.939
 I'm going to put on my boots right now 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.450
 to climb from me thrill to look for them 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.440
 here they are to climb this wall 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.659
 it could also be with a goal 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.609
 but we have arrived here 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.609
 we have to talk to this staff 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.649
 it's worth this character we have to 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.630
 give him the headdress of me thrill is that 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.140
 we had already made it before so 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.229
 we go 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.500
 to enter our treasures and we're going 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.500
 to look where we have it here is 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.900

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.390
 and here we have the red ego brick 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.239
 which is called hearts of me thrill and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.120
 it will cost us 75,000 coins or 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.049
 pieces of lego 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.989

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.170

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.989
 say that we are invincible but yes that 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.239
 we are going to take much longer to lose 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.739
