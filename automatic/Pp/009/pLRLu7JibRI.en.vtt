00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.670
 carps games boys and well found in 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.220
 this new tasty video in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.860
 this video I'll show you let's say the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
 coup that I managed to do in the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.480
 equal purchases of mercatopoli vi 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 let's say, follow the video 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 to the end to actually understand 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 what the value of this title 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.380
 because probably to most 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 of you will not say much or fingers this 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.140
 game is worth so it is impossible 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.279
 impossible 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 Let's start the site in question immediately 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.880
 binds and all that now working at 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.170
 twentieth time but not me at the entrance 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
 he slams a cock and we can then 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 continue network 4 euros however it was there 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 so from November they applied me on 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 70 80 has less faults I paid from the 320 the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.469
 they pay attention to Italian 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.300
 this is what we say makes it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 so we say sought is valid disk of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 game that we will then analyze because here we are 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.270
 the proofs actually are that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 this is one of the valid versions 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.270
 booklet practically new full- bodied 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.060
 colors and also the xbox card said 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 what I tell the truth I did not know of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 value of this game I like prosecco 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 bring the testimony of the former 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 Registered say we move a second 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.750
 on the PC to see in short I click on 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 drive 3 suites and their live 3 on 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.490
 wikipedia to see if it was a game 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.390
 released exclusively in xbox or otherwise 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.600
 there was for the playstation 2 also and I read 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.820
 this title is a 3d fighting game 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.829
 belonging to the homonymous saga released 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 exclusively for microsoft xbox 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.840
 in short, the first titles published 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 however American console of this game 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 there are only two versions in which it comes 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.430
 of which was spoken below was 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.649
 produced in Italy only for 200 pieces e 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.920
 this is why it is very complex and rare 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.670
 find it to recognize this version 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.000
 rare of the very famous game is visible 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.790
 on the end of the cd the code we speak 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.440
 forward we read everything first is number 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.000
 hicks 08 61 69 even today is a lot 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.750
 difficult to find dante 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.970
 the value of the game is 75 euros 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.060
 precisely in europe 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 I'd say move to the cd when you guys 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.350
 I read the code taken I don't know if not 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.210
 we read we are the light of the code 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.310
 present on cd I couldn't believe it 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.800
 my copy paid one euro was 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.670
 actually the valid one does not make a 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.100
 fire 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.090
 let's see if we can focus and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.510
 universal a rock but still tells you 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:49.070

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.950
 I honestly when I read the code 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.600
 on wikipedia and read the call on the cd ho 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.700
