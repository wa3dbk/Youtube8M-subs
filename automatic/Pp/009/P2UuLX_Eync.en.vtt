00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.250
 but at the same time we will also 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 efforts of the us drug investigators shown 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 they try to kill the king 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.360
 to bring the route 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 an absolute tip and I know too 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.950

 Assassin's creed movie popped up 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.200
 All in all, not bad 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.520
 you can not go wrong too much 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.570
 Especially since we do it with the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.369
 character not yet to do 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.690
 and the extra for the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.370
 film was invented 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.710
 Incidentally , aguilar was probably from the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.780
 spain of the 15th century and as 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.550

 rumored about the plot of episode 7 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.140
 That's not how it can be 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.840
 unlikely 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.400
