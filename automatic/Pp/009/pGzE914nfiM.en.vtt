00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
piece off and put the back on the Box in

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.790 
piece off and put the back on the Box in
it<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> little<00:03:36.280> bit<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.810> might<00:03:37.959> be<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.140> sensor

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
it a little bit that might be a sensor

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.020 
it a little bit that might be a sensor
or<00:03:38.860> something<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.400> looks<00:03:39.550> like<00:03:39.640> that's<00:03:39.790> a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
or something it looks like that's a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.640 
or something it looks like that's a
sense<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.630> little<00:03:40.840> black<00:03:40.959> dot<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:41.290> there

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
sense of that little black dot up there

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.500 
sense of that little black dot up there
I<00:03:41.860> thought<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.549> was<00:03:42.670> something<00:03:43.150> else<00:03:43.330> but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
I thought that was something else but

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.350 
I thought that was something else but
looks<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.810> could<00:03:43.930> be<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.080> sensor<00:03:44.440> or<00:03:44.470> something

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
looks I could be a sensor or something

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.030 
looks I could be a sensor or something
so<00:03:46.360> this<00:03:46.630> feels<00:03:46.930> really<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.500> said<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.860> has<00:03:48.010> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
so this feels really I said it has a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.310 
so this feels really I said it has a
little<00:03:48.250> bit<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.640> kisa<00:03:48.850> adhesive<00:03:49.630> down

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
little bit of the kisa adhesive down

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.600 
little bit of the kisa adhesive down
there<00:03:50.500> at<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.620> bottom<00:03:50.680> but<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.040> bet<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.459> get

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
there at the bottom but I bet I can get

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.430 
there at the bottom but I bet I can get
it<00:03:51.730> off<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.900> little<00:03:53.140> apple

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
it off but you have the little apple

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.690 
it off but you have the little apple
logo<00:03:53.530> right<00:03:54.070> down<00:03:54.250> there<00:03:54.459> you<00:03:54.580> have<00:03:54.670> the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
logo right down there you have the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.280 
logo right down there you have the
little<00:03:55.000> sensors<00:03:55.420> all<00:03:55.600> around<00:03:55.630> here<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.049> think

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
little sensors all around here I think

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.860 
little sensors all around here I think
there<00:03:56.620> might<00:03:56.709> be<00:03:56.769> an<00:03:56.920> on/off<00:03:57.280> switch<00:03:57.870> yep

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
there might be an on/off switch yep

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.229 
there might be an on/off switch yep
that's<00:03:59.380> probably<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.739> on/off<00:03:59.980> switch<00:04:00.250> yep

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
that's probably the on/off switch yep

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.789 
that's probably the on/off switch yep
and<00:04:01.420> then<00:04:01.660> there's<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.049> little<00:04:02.380> green<00:04:02.560> light

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
and then there's the little green light

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.630 
and then there's the little green light
um<00:04:03.790> but<00:04:04.239> shut<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.570> off<00:04:04.660> really<00:04:04.810> quickly<00:04:05.640> wow

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
um but shut it off really quickly wow

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.850 
um but shut it off really quickly wow
this<00:04:06.850> looks<00:04:07.030> really<00:04:07.299> nice<00:04:07.450> in<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.989> front<00:04:08.320> it's

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
this looks really nice in the front it's

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.490 
this looks really nice in the front it's
why<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.100> has<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.459> little<00:04:09.549> arc<00:04:09.910> sheep<00:04:10.380> kind<00:04:11.380> of

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
why it has this little arc sheep kind of

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.550 
why it has this little arc sheep kind of
