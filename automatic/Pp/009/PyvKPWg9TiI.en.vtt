00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
gravity rails canon sort of thing where

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.450 
gravity rails canon sort of thing where
i<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.779> had<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.320> thing<00:00:25.590> sliding<00:00:26.279> back

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
as it slides slides back and with that
only<00:00:32.279> had<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:32.669> round<00:00:32.940> firing<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.750> guys

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
wanted to see this thing was actually

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
wanted to see this thing was actually
capable<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.520> firing<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.360> than<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.720> round

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
capable of firing more than one round

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
capable of firing more than one round
now<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.729> beauty<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
now that this kind of look beauty of

now that this kind of look beauty of
having<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.900> whole<00:01:19.110> gravity<00:01:19.439> sliding<00:01:20.040> along

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
having the whole gravity sliding along

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.469 
having the whole gravity sliding along
here<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.610> shoot<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> rounds<00:01:21.360> off

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
here so I can shoot the rounds off

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
here so I can shoot the rounds off
whenever<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.320> however<00:01:22.560> fast<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.189> want<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the first round you have the second

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.280 
the first round you have the second
round<00:01:26.159> you'll<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> third<00:01:27.180> round<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
round you'll have the third round at the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.630 
round you'll have the third round at the
end<00:01:28.409> we'll<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> fourth<00:01:29.070> round<00:01:29.250> here

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
end we'll have the fourth round here

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.359 
end we'll have the fourth round here
these<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.570> their<00:01:30.689> own<00:01:31.009> stone<00:01:32.009> inside

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
these will have their own stone inside

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.120 
these will have their own stone inside
of<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.030> they<00:01:33.869> should<00:01:34.079> launch<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.680> by<00:01:34.860> one

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of it so they should launch one by one

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090 
of it so they should launch one by one
the<00:01:35.759> only<00:01:36.060> thing<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.930> being<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.829> problem

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the only thing I can see being a problem

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
the only thing I can see being a problem
is<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.579> occasionally<00:01:39.240> whenever<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.600> launched

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
is that occasionally whenever I launched

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.859 
is that occasionally whenever I launched
the<00:01:40.020> first<00:01:40.290> round<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.970> gets<00:01:42.299> stuck<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the first round it gets stuck and it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.740 
the first round it gets stuck and it
blows<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.229> around<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.000> don't<00:01:45.659> know

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
blows up around about here I don't know

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.359 
blows up around about here I don't know
why<00:01:46.049> I've<00:01:46.290> checked<00:01:46.590> everything<00:01:46.890> everything

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
why I've checked everything everything

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.840 
why I've checked everything everything
smooth<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:48.090> no<00:01:48.240> bombs<00:01:48.600> there's<00:01:49.110> no

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
smooth there's no bombs there's no

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.100 
smooth there's no bombs there's no
oddities<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.090> anything<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.899> what<00:01:51.990> I've<00:01:52.079> done

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
oddities or anything so what I've done

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620 
oddities or anything so what I've done
to<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> front<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> round<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:54.450> least

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to the front of the round here at least

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630 
to the front of the round here at least
in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> plaza<00:01:54.960> actually<00:01:55.350> collide<00:01:55.710> I've<00:01:56.340> kind

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
in the plaza actually collide I've kind

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
in the plaza actually collide I've kind
of<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.820> removed<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> sharp<00:01:58.049> edges<00:01:58.229> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
of just removed all the sharp edges so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.580 
of just removed all the sharp edges so
hopefully<00:01:59.009> should<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.369> smooth<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.880> mean<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> have

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
hopefully should be smooth I mean I have

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
hopefully should be smooth I mean I have
considered<00:02:01.969> okay<00:02:02.969> well<00:02:03.210> actually<00:02:03.329> that's<00:02:03.600> why

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
considered okay well actually that's why

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.270 
considered okay well actually that's why
I<00:02:03.899> can't<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.829> actual

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
I can't do that because of the actual

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.530 
I can't do that because of the actual
landing<00:02:05.520> gears<00:02:05.729> connected<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.479> some

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
landing gears connected to it in some

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.559 
landing gears connected to it in some
way<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.469> really<00:02:08.039> can't<00:02:08.069> improve<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.360> first

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
way so I really can't improve the first

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.390 
way so I really can't improve the first
round<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.619> blows<00:02:10.800> up<00:02:10.860> I'll<00:02:11.250> just

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
round at all so it blows up I'll just

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
round at all so it blows up I'll just
continue<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.150> I'll<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.450> file<00:02:12.900> via<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
continue and I'll just file via the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.850 
continue and I'll just file via the
extra

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
extra

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550 
extra
she<00:02:13.980> rounds<00:02:14.510> afterwards<00:02:15.510> as<00:02:15.600> well<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.380> let<00:02:16.500> me

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
she rounds afterwards as well so let me

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.960 
she rounds afterwards as well so let me
get<00:02:16.680> into<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> top<00:02:17.160> here<00:02:17.370> I've<00:02:17.520> actually<00:02:17.700> put

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
get into the top here I've actually put

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.550 
get into the top here I've actually put
the<00:02:18.060> comfort<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.570> top<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the comfort on the top because it's a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.040 
the comfort on the top because it's a
lot<00:02:19.680> easier<00:02:19.710> I'll<00:02:20.520> get<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.780> will

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
lot easier I'll get in and I will

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.480 
lot easier I'll get in and I will
release<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.650> landing<00:02:22.860> gear<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> don't

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
release the landing gear so I don't

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.710 
release the landing gear so I don't
actually<00:02:23.580> cause<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.880> thing<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.330> move<00:02:24.510> like

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
actually cause the thing to move like

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.630 
actually cause the thing to move like
I've<00:02:24.840> done<00:02:25.020> several<00:02:25.290> times<00:02:25.620> before<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.130> I'll

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
I've done several times before and I'll

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.400 
I've done several times before and I'll
start<00:02:26.910> flying<00:02:27.210> backwards<00:02:27.600> very<00:02:27.810> very<00:02:28.050> slowly

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
start flying backwards very very slowly

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.650 
start flying backwards very very slowly
and<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.520> weren't<00:02:29.760> very<00:02:29.910> sweet<00:02:30.210> I'll

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
and to like it weren't very sweet I'll

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.120 
and to like it weren't very sweet I'll
fly<00:02:30.870> backwards<00:02:31.230> until<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.500> first<00:02:31.710> round<00:02:31.890> is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
fly backwards until the first round is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.160 
fly backwards until the first round is
released<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.880> then<00:02:33.060> actually<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:33.900> if<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.050> go

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
released and then actually what if I go

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.410 
released and then actually what if I go
it's<00:02:34.920> because<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.460> maybe<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.240> bit

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
it's because I can go maybe a little bit

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.230 
it's because I can go maybe a little bit
slower<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.760> around<00:02:38.760> itself<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.150> always

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
slower so that around itself is always

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.080 
slower so that around itself is always
pulled<00:02:39.900> slightly<00:02:40.530> out<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.430> can't<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> best

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
pulled slightly out I can't get the best

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
pulled slightly out I can't get the best
camera<00:02:42.540> angle<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> apologize<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.410> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
camera angle and I apologize for that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
camera angle and I apologize for that
it's<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.640> such<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> finicky<00:02:45.560> system

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
it's just this is such a finicky system

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.320 
it's just this is such a finicky system
to<00:02:46.709> working<00:02:47.160> with<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.520> getting<00:02:47.790> any<00:02:47.940> decent

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
to working with that getting any decent

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.080 
to working with that getting any decent
camera<00:02:48.480> angle<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.160> near<00:02:50.160> impossible<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.880> there

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
camera angle is near impossible so there

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.060 
camera angle is near impossible so there
we<00:02:51.209> go<00:02:51.240> i<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.900> thing<00:02:52.080> i<00:02:52.350> don't<00:02:52.950> think

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
we go i can see this thing i don't think

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.280 
we go i can see this thing i don't think
i'm<00:02:53.130> even<00:02:53.220> close<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.820> yet<00:02:54.110> you'll<00:02:55.110> know

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
i'm even close to it yet you'll know

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.449 
i'm even close to it yet you'll know
because<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.709> world<00:02:55.890> will<00:02:56.040> stuck<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
because the world will stuck it in

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.370 
because the world will stuck it in
really<00:02:56.640> laggy<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.390> i<00:02:57.510> start<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.780> pull<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.200> I

and that should hit the ship to hit the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.009 
and that should hit the ship to hit the
ship<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:18.560> kaboom<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.670> what<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:21.930> at

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
ship and kaboom so what you can do at

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.020 
ship and kaboom so what you can do at
this<00:03:22.110> stage<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.610> one<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:23.880> things

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
this stage is you do one of two things

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.390 
this stage is you do one of two things
you<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.600> lock<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.049> down<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.130> someone

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you can lock this down then get someone

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.070 
you can lock this down then get someone
actually<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.030> cannon<00:03:27.450> itself<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.900> lock

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
actually on the cannon itself to lock

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.479 
actually on the cannon itself to lock
down<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.410> rounds<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:28.860> can<00:03:28.980> rotate<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
down the rounds and you can rotate a

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.880 
down the rounds and you can rotate a
name<00:03:29.790> where<00:03:30.030> wherever<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.570> want<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.410> let's

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
name where wherever you want but let's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.229 
name where wherever you want but let's
just<00:03:31.950> do<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:32.190> quickly<00:03:32.459> let's<00:03:32.730> fly<00:03:32.910> back<00:03:33.090> here

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
just do this quickly let's fly back here

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.970 
just do this quickly let's fly back here
let's<00:03:33.510> show<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.660> shot<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.140> next<00:03:34.380> next<00:03:34.709> few

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
let's show it shot the next next few

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.550 
let's show it shot the next next few
rounds<00:03:35.390> here<00:03:36.390> you'll<00:03:36.630> see<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.049> round<00:03:37.260> at<00:03:37.440> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
rounds here you'll see the round at the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.410 
rounds here you'll see the round at the
back<00:03:37.709> there<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:38.220> pulled<00:03:38.489> along<00:03:38.730> basically

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
back there get pulled along basically

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.900 
back there get pulled along basically
now<00:03:40.130> hopefully<00:03:41.130> these<00:03:41.160> don't<00:03:41.489> collide<00:03:41.760> at

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
now hopefully these don't collide at

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.289 
now hopefully these don't collide at
Baylor<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:43.650> launched<00:03:43.920> up<00:03:44.190> are<00:03:45.060> getting

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
Baylor and that launched up are getting

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.720 
Baylor and that launched up are getting
like<00:03:45.420> 10<00:03:45.870> FPS<00:03:46.080> my<00:03:46.530> FPS<00:03:46.860> is<00:03:47.010> really<00:03:47.489> slowing

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
like 10 FPS my FPS is really slowing

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.660 
like 10 FPS my FPS is really slowing
down<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.989> let's<00:03:49.230> uh<00:03:49.470> let's<00:03:49.769> launch<00:03:50.400> this

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
down here so let's uh let's launch this

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.490 
down here so let's uh let's launch this
one<00:03:53.150> okay<00:03:54.150> there<00:03:54.330> we<00:03:54.420> go<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.750> managed<00:03:55.410> to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
one okay there we go I managed to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650 
one okay there we go I managed to
stabilize<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.950> think<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.269> candidate

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
stabilize I think because the candidate

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.870 
stabilize I think because the candidate
itself<00:03:57.989> started<00:03:58.350> drifting<00:03:58.590> forwards<00:03:59.100> ok<00:03:59.820> so

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
itself started drifting forwards ok so

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.610 
itself started drifting forwards ok so
that's<00:04:00.150> what<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.330> can<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.570> whenever<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.290> fire

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
that's what I can do whenever you fire

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.190 
that's what I can do whenever you fire
around<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.760> cannon<00:04:03.330> itself<00:04:03.360> starts<00:04:03.989> flying

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
around the cannon itself starts flying

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.020 
around the cannon itself starts flying
forwards<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:04.799> well<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.549> what<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.760> want<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:05.970> do

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
forwards as well so what you want to do

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.550 
forwards as well so what you want to do
is<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.150> just<00:04:06.239> want<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> engage<00:04:06.630> your<00:04:06.930> locks<00:04:07.260> on

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
is you just want to engage your locks on

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.990 
is you just want to engage your locks on
the<00:04:07.680> actual<00:04:07.980> slider<00:04:08.280> thing<00:04:08.519> here<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:08.880> that

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
the actual slider thing here and that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.090 
the actual slider thing here and that
should<00:04:09.180> slow<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:10.440> should<00:04:10.590> actually<00:04:10.709> stop

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
should slow that should actually stop

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.130 
should slow that should actually stop
the<00:04:11.130> thing<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.489> then<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.640> can<00:04:11.880> release<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.540> fly

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
the thing and then I can release and fly

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.140 
the thing and then I can release and fly
back<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:13.560> further<00:04:13.950> I'll<00:04:14.670> get<00:04:14.850> out<00:04:14.910> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
back in further I'll get out and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.240 
back in further I'll get out and
actually<00:04:15.180> go<00:04:15.510> with<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.780> realm<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.769> guys

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
actually go with this realm so you guys

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.789 
actually go with this realm so you guys
can<00:04:17.459> see<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.880> clearly<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.959> thing<00:04:19.320> that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
can see that clearly this thing that

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.380 
can see that clearly this thing that
arethe<00:04:20.070> punch<00:04:20.340> oh<00:04:20.609> wow<00:04:20.880> most<00:04:21.120> already

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
arethe punch oh wow most already

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.740 
arethe punch oh wow most already
launched<00:04:21.660> out<00:04:21.810> there

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
launched out there

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.700 
launched out there
are<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.470> coming<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.890> was<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.160> already<00:04:24.430> come

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
are you coming I was it already come

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.670 
are you coming I was it already come
whoa<00:04:26.710> whoa<00:04:27.160> oh<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:28.570> must<00:04:28.810> have<00:04:28.960> got<00:04:29.080> stuck<00:04:29.320> okay

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
whoa whoa oh it must have got stuck okay

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.490 
whoa whoa oh it must have got stuck okay
as<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.970> said<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.270> think<00:04:31.660> that<00:04:32.050> no<00:04:32.200> actually<00:04:32.440> I

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
as I said I think that no actually I

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.960 
as I said I think that no actually I
think<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.770> last<00:04:32.950> round<00:04:33.100> was<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.280> bit<00:04:33.490> buggy<00:04:33.760> as

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
think that last round was a bit buggy as

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.670 
think that last round was a bit buggy as
it<00:04:34.120> was<00:04:34.330> oh<00:04:34.600> no<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:37.720> got<00:04:37.930> stuck<00:04:38.200> it<00:04:38.440> must<00:04:38.590> have

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
it was oh no it got stuck it must have

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.610 
it was oh no it got stuck it must have
got<00:04:38.770> stuck<00:04:38.950> at<00:04:39.040> some<00:04:39.190> point<00:04:39.430> oh<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:41.350> poor

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
got stuck at some point oh the poor

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.280 
got stuck at some point oh the poor
thing<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:42.100> tried<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:43.090> actually<00:04:43.810> know<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.170> was

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
thing that tried I actually know it was

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.200 
thing that tried I actually know it was
the<00:04:44.470> back<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.950> dead<00:04:45.130> load<00:04:45.460> not<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.730> front<00:04:45.940> so

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
the back of a dead load not the front so

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.670 
the back of a dead load not the front so
most<00:04:46.390> have<00:04:46.570> any<00:04:46.720> collision<00:04:47.230> thing<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.590> must

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
most have any collision thing it must

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.400 
most have any collision thing it must
have<00:04:47.830> just<00:04:47.860> been<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.960> random<00:04:49.960> bug<00:04:50.290> that

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
have just been a random bug that

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.530 
have just been a random bug that
happened<00:04:51.000> but<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.120> i<00:04:52.150> said<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.390> back

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
happened but like i said the back

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.180 
happened but like i said the back
shouldn't<00:04:52.960> explode<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.620> should<00:04:53.800> be<00:04:53.890> if

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
shouldn't explode it should be if

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.770 
shouldn't explode it should be if
anything<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.820> front<00:04:55.090> should<00:04:55.240> explode<00:04:55.570> on

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
anything that front should explode on

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.170 
anything that front should explode on
impact<00:04:55.960> or<00:04:56.500> one<00:04:56.620> of<00:04:56.650> those<00:04:56.800> slides<00:04:57.130> but<00:04:58.120> i

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
impact or one of those slides but i

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.420 
impact or one of those slides but i
highly<00:04:58.419> doubt<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.560> the<00:05:00.160> back<00:05:00.280> would

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
highly doubt that the the back would

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.909 
highly doubt that the the back would
explode<00:05:00.760> from<00:05:00.940> touching<00:05:01.360> us<00:05:01.570> hopping<00:05:01.919> snc

here<00:05:03.130> all<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.400> rails<00:05:03.580> are<00:05:03.730> now<00:05:03.850> loose<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.900> all

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
here all the rails are now loose and all

here all the rails are now loose and all
over<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.230> place<00:05:06.090> but<00:05:07.090> we<00:05:07.240> did<00:05:07.360> manage<00:05:07.480> to

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
over the place but we did manage to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.180 
over the place but we did manage to
successfully<00:05:08.169> launch<00:05:08.590> of<00:05:08.830> these<00:05:08.950> three

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
successfully launch of these three

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.270 
successfully launch of these three
rounds<00:05:09.630> mine<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:11.110> odd<00:05:11.650> exploration<00:05:12.250> of

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
rounds mine is that odd exploration of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.260 
rounds mine is that odd exploration of
the<00:05:12.340> bank<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.610> probably<00:05:12.790> should<00:05:12.970> have<00:05:13.000> watched

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
the bank I probably should have watched

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.210 
the bank I probably should have watched
that<00:05:13.419> as<00:05:13.630> I<00:05:13.750> was<00:05:13.870> launching<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.560> think<00:05:15.100> it

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
that as I was launching it I think it

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.070 
that as I was launching it I think it
may<00:05:15.400> have<00:05:15.430> gotten<00:05:15.730> stuck<00:05:16.060> at<00:05:16.210> some<00:05:16.419> point<00:05:16.720> but

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
may have gotten stuck at some point but

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.170 
may have gotten stuck at some point but
uh<00:05:17.110> from<00:05:18.100> three<00:05:18.400> rounds<00:05:18.820> we<00:05:18.910> managed<00:05:19.150> to

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
uh from three rounds we managed to

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.870 
uh from three rounds we managed to
obliterate<00:05:19.840> with<00:05:20.470> a<00:05:20.500> majority<00:05:21.250> of<00:05:21.280> this<00:05:21.580> ship

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
obliterate with a majority of this ship

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.200 
obliterate with a majority of this ship
here<00:05:22.260> well<00:05:23.260> wait<00:05:23.500> up<00:05:23.730> FPS<00:05:24.730> is<00:05:24.850> going<00:05:25.060> really

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
here well wait up FPS is going really

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.530 
here well wait up FPS is going really
low<00:05:25.480> I<00:05:25.720> know<00:05:26.230> about<00:05:26.440> for<00:05:27.060> what's<00:05:28.060> happening

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.520 

something's<00:05:31.540> happening<00:05:31.870> over<00:05:32.080> here<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.500> I

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
something's happening over here and I

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.780 
something's happening over here and I
think<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:32.919> lagging<00:05:33.160> me<00:05:33.400> out<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:33.580> I'm<00:05:33.640> going

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
to try and fly over here at three EPs to

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.650 
to try and fly over here at three EPs to
try<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:36.700> stop<00:05:36.910> whatever<00:05:37.630> this<00:05:37.870> is<00:05:39.630> no<00:05:42.660> yes

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
what's this part of the cans actually

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.460 
what's this part of the cans actually
flying<00:05:58.180> towards<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.630> ship<00:05:58.840> so<00:05:59.169> hopefully

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
flying towards the ship so hopefully

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.180 
flying towards the ship so hopefully
I'll<00:05:59.530> be<00:05:59.560> able<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.800> get<00:05:59.919> there<00:06:00.040> in<00:06:00.160> time

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
I'll be able to get there in time

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.540 
I'll be able to get there in time
beforehand<00:06:01.620> yeah<00:06:02.620> it<00:06:02.830> shouldn't<00:06:03.100> matter<00:06:03.280> too

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
beforehand yeah it shouldn't matter too

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.760 
beforehand yeah it shouldn't matter too
much<00:06:03.580> so<00:06:04.150> as<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.330> guys<00:06:04.540> can<00:06:04.690> see<00:06:04.750> clearly<00:06:05.350> the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
much so as you guys can see clearly the

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.230 
much so as you guys can see clearly the
front<00:06:06.160> part<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.430> ship<00:06:06.640> is<00:06:06.760> being<00:06:06.880> wiped<00:06:07.090> out

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
front part this ship is being wiped out

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.090 
front part this ship is being wiped out
i<00:06:07.300> think<00:06:07.450> i<00:06:07.900> feel<00:06:08.410> around<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:08.890> you<00:06:08.919> can

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
i think i feel around so you can

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.980 
i think i feel around so you can
actually<00:06:09.340> hit<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:09.820> thing<00:06:10.030> because<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.479> first

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
actually hit the thing because the first

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.960 
actually hit the thing because the first
two<00:06:11.290> I<00:06:11.320> think<00:06:11.560> we're<00:06:11.860> she<00:06:12.040> enough<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.460> destroy

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
two I think we're she enough to destroy

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.840 
two I think we're she enough to destroy
most<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.450> it<00:06:13.600> here<00:06:14.590> you<00:06:14.740> come<00:06:14.919> cannon<00:06:15.460> come

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
most of it here you come cannon come

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.060 
most of it here you come cannon come
anyways<00:06:16.690> yeah<00:06:16.840> I'll<00:06:17.350> do<00:06:17.500> this<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.740> just<00:06:17.770> want<00:06:18.040> to

what<00:06:19.600> it<00:06:19.720> was<00:06:19.810> like<00:06:19.960> firing<00:06:20.380> multiple<00:06:20.650> rounds

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
what it was like firing multiple rounds

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.990 
what it was like firing multiple rounds
from<00:06:21.310> that<00:06:21.460> because<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.669> was<00:06:21.880> actually

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
from that because that was actually

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.270 
from that because that was actually
requested<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:22.900> now<00:06:23.710> probably<00:06:23.919> going<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.190> go

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
requested and now probably going to go

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.650 
requested and now probably going to go
back<00:06:24.430> to<00:06:24.550> sleep<00:06:24.760> because<00:06:24.880> i<00:06:25.120> still<00:06:25.390> haven't

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660
