00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
of faucet now we're going to actually

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.580 
of faucet now we're going to actually
show<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:41.359> being<00:00:42.050> hooked<00:00:42.289> up<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.559> a

show this to you being hooked up to a
faucet<00:00:43.070> specifically<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:43.879> won't<00:00:44.030> work<00:00:44.210> with

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
faucet specifically now won't work with

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.479 
faucet specifically now won't work with
some<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.539> those<00:00:44.719> uniquely<00:00:45.469> designed<00:00:45.620> faucets

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
some of those uniquely designed faucets

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.490 
some of those uniquely designed faucets
it<00:00:46.820> will<00:00:47.120> work<00:00:47.269> for<00:00:47.390> about<00:00:47.510> 90%<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.379> the

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
it will work for about 90% of the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.079 
it will work for about 90% of the
standard<00:00:48.859> faucets<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.640> we'll<00:00:49.730> show<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:49.940> an

standard faucets and we'll show you an

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.489 
standard faucets and we'll show you an
operation<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:50.690> you<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.929> course<00:00:51.140> look<00:00:51.350> at<00:00:51.410> the

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
operation so you of course look at the

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.169 
operation so you of course look at the
faucet<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:51.980> it's<00:00:52.129> working<00:00:52.309> on<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.999> be<00:00:53.120> able

faucet that it's working on to be able
to<00:00:53.269> make<00:00:53.449> sure<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:53.839> works<00:00:54.019> with<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.260> one

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
to make sure that it works with the one

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.860

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
really want to emphasize this is being a

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.299 
really want to emphasize this is being a
great<00:00:59.390> solution<00:00:59.829> is<00:01:00.829> because<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.129> lot<00:01:01.280> of

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
great solution is because a lot of

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.399 
great solution is because a lot of
people<00:01:01.460> have<00:01:01.699> also<00:01:01.820> tried<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.659> figure<00:01:02.989> out<00:01:03.170> how

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
people have also tried to figure out how

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.500 
people have also tried to figure out how
to<00:01:03.440> use<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.070> water<00:01:04.400> filter<00:01:04.910> especially<00:01:05.390> these

to use a water filter especially these
really<00:01:05.870> inexpensive<00:01:06.130> but<00:01:07.130> very<00:01:07.730> valuable

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
really inexpensive but very valuable

hose connection this is an inline water

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.480 
hose connection this is an inline water
filter<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.650> will<00:01:15.770> actually<00:01:15.920> filter<00:01:16.340> out

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
filter that will actually filter out

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.180 
filter that will actually filter out
into<00:01:16.790> chlorinate<00:01:17.300> up<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.930> 30,000<00:01:18.710> gallons<00:01:18.740> of

don't have a hose bib so here's the top

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.910 
don't have a hose bib so here's the top
piece<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.690> hose<00:01:29.840> connector<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.860> is

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
piece of the hose connector this is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.350 
piece of the hose connector this is
actually<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.460> piece<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.850> going<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.060> clamp

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
actually the piece is going to clamp

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.660 
actually the piece is going to clamp
down<00:01:32.480> on<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:33.320> your<00:01:33.440> faucet<00:01:33.710> connection<00:01:34.400> and

down on to your faucet connection and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.340 
down on to your faucet connection and
then<00:01:35.060> we<00:01:35.270> have<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.870> we<00:01:35.990> have<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.110> rubber

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
then we have here is we have a rubber

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.080 
then we have here is we have a rubber
piece<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:37.220> rubber<00:01:37.490> piece<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.880> actually

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
piece this rubber piece is actually

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.240 
piece this rubber piece is actually
going<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.230> gasket<00:01:39.800> that's<00:01:40.040> going<00:01:40.190> to

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
going to be the gasket that's going to

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.920 
going to be the gasket that's going to
attach<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.850> bottom<00:01:41.150> of<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.330> faucet<00:01:41.540> and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
attach to the bottom of the faucet and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.510 
attach to the bottom of the faucet and
then<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.410> water<00:01:42.620> is<00:01:42.740> going<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.890> come<00:01:42.980> out<00:01:43.190> this

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
then the water is going to come out this

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.670 
then the water is going to come out this
side<00:01:43.790> now<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.390> course<00:01:44.660> this<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.050> hose<00:01:45.350> thread

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
side now of course this is a hose thread

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.450 
side now of course this is a hose thread
on<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:46.010> side<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:48.380> look<00:01:48.530> at<00:01:48.650> this<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:49.400> is

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
on this side but look at this this is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.850 
on this side but look at this this is
the<00:01:49.670> first<00:01:50.060> solution<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.440> we've<00:01:51.590> been<00:01:51.770> able

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
the first solution that we've been able

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.070 
the first solution that we've been able
to<00:01:52.010> find<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:52.550> gardeners<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.270> be<00:01:53.480> able<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.690> use

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
to find for gardeners to be able to use

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.350 
to find for gardeners to be able to use
an<00:01:54.380> inline<00:01:55.190> carbon<00:01:56.030> filter<00:01:56.500> with<00:01:57.500> their

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
an inline carbon filter with their

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.480 
an inline carbon filter with their
faucet<00:01:59.360> essentially<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.130> great<00:02:01.310> thing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
faucet essentially and the great thing

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.040 
faucet essentially and the great thing
about<00:02:01.580> these<00:02:01.760> filters<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.390> also<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.870> fact

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
about these filters is also the fact

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.300 
about these filters is also the fact
that<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.230> don't<00:02:03.290> lose<00:02:03.500> any<00:02:03.530> pressure<00:02:04.010> you're

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
that you don't lose any pressure you're

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.350 
that you don't lose any pressure you're
not<00:02:04.400> going<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.610> sit<00:02:04.760> around<00:02:04.850> waiting<00:02:05.090> for<00:02:05.270> your

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
not going to sit around waiting for your

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.250 
not going to sit around waiting for your
water<00:02:05.540> you're<00:02:05.720> still<00:02:05.840> going<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.080> same

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
water you're still going to the same

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.109 
water you're still going to the same
pressure<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.920> same<00:02:07.280> amount<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.670> flow<00:02:07.880> that

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
pressure the same amount of flow that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.460 
pressure the same amount of flow that
you<00:02:08.240> would<00:02:08.360> get<00:02:08.539> out<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.690> your<00:02:08.840> faucet<00:02:09.080> but

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
you would get out of your faucet but

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.430 
you would get out of your faucet but
you'll<00:02:09.619> now<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:09.830> filter<00:02:10.369> water<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.910> our

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
you'll now have filter water for our

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.960 
you'll now have filter water for our
and<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:12.010> course<00:02:12.250> you'll<00:02:12.430> be<00:02:12.490> able<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> use<00:02:12.940> a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
and of course you'll be able to use a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.420 
and of course you'll be able to use a
hose<00:02:13.330> indoors<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:13.960> well<00:02:13.990> let's<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.100> ahead<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
hose indoors as well let's go ahead and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.020 
hose indoors as well let's go ahead and
show<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.270> garden<00:02:17.020> life<00:02:17.290> connector<00:02:18.190> in

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
show you the garden life connector in

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.440 
show you the garden life connector in
action<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.320> actually<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:22.390> a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
action this is actually a just a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.000 
action this is actually a just a
standard<00:02:22.750> faucet<00:02:23.200> most<00:02:23.380> people<00:02:23.710> would<00:02:23.830> have

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
standard faucet most people would have

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.220 
standard faucet most people would have
in<00:02:24.610> their<00:02:24.760> stank<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.540> actually<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.080> little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
in their stank it's actually a little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.680 
in their stank it's actually a little
bit<00:02:26.410> deeper<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.860> sink<00:02:27.100> too<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.570> you'll

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
bit deeper of a sink too and what you'll

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.300 
bit deeper of a sink too and what you'll
see<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.930> there's<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.170> white<00:02:29.380> gasket<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> rubber

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
see is there's a white gasket a rubber

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.560 
see is there's a white gasket a rubber
piece<00:02:30.550> on<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.880> side<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.300> what's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
piece on this side that's what's

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.670 
piece on this side that's what's
supposed<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.870> actually<00:02:32.110> connect<00:02:32.380> into<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
supposed to actually connect into the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.320 
supposed to actually connect into the
bottom<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.220> faucet<00:02:33.430> which<00:02:33.970> will<00:02:34.120> be<00:02:34.210> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
bottom of the faucet which will be the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.760 
bottom of the faucet which will be the
gasket<00:02:34.720> they'll<00:02:34.870> basically<00:02:35.260> keep<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> water

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
gasket they'll basically keep the water

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.580 
gasket they'll basically keep the water
from<00:02:36.040> leaking<00:02:36.280> out<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.540> all<00:02:37.750> I'm<00:02:37.960> doing<00:02:37.990> is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
from leaking out so all I'm doing is

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.310 
from leaking out so all I'm doing is
tightening<00:02:39.160> up<00:02:39.340> screwing<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.300> gasket<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.080> fit

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
tightening up screwing the gasket to fit

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.390 
tightening up screwing the gasket to fit
snugly<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:44.080> see<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.650> space<00:02:45.070> right

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
snugly and you can see the space right

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.120 
snugly and you can see the space right
here<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:47.110> space<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.740> going<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.950> be<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
here that space is going to be the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.760 
here that space is going to be the
acceptable<00:02:48.820> space<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:50.380> would<00:02:50.500> be<00:02:50.620> able

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
acceptable space that you would be able

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.610 
acceptable space that you would be able
to<00:02:50.860> fit<00:02:51.040> your<00:02:51.160> faucet<00:02:51.640> head<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.990> facing

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
to fit your faucet head in this facing

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.750 
to fit your faucet head in this facing
right<00:02:53.800> here<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.690> roughly<00:02:56.100> let's<00:02:57.100> call<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.550> it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
right here is roughly let's call it it's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.880 
right here is roughly let's call it it's
right<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.870> hair<00:02:59.080> over<00:02:59.110> one<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.710> half

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
right it's a hair over one and a half

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.460 
right it's a hair over one and a half
inches<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:00.610> first<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.990> release<00:03:02.170> our

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
inches but first to release our

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.560 
inches but first to release our
liability<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.190> what<00:03:03.430> size<00:03:03.730> faucets<00:03:04.300> that<00:03:04.360> will

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
liability of what size faucets that will

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.570 
liability of what size faucets that will
fit<00:03:04.780> we'll<00:03:04.990> just<00:03:05.260> assume<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.130> about<00:03:06.310> one<00:03:06.490> and

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
fit we'll just assume it's about one and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.230 
fit we'll just assume it's about one and
a<00:03:06.670> half<00:03:06.700> inches<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.650> should<00:03:08.830> fit<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
a half inches and so it should fit a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.820 
a half inches and so it should fit a
faucet<00:03:10.240> head<00:03:10.390> that's<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.750> no<00:03:11.320> more<00:03:11.560> than<00:03:11.710> one

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
faucet head that's a no more than one

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.040 
faucet head that's a no more than one
and<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> half<00:03:12.070> inches<00:03:12.460> in<00:03:12.670> width<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.630> what<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:13.930> do

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
and a half inches in width so what we do

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.530 
and a half inches in width so what we do
is<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.350> tighten<00:03:14.650> up<00:03:14.710> this<00:03:14.920> gasket<00:03:15.190> piece<00:03:15.670> to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
is just tighten up this gasket piece to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.510 
is just tighten up this gasket piece to
the<00:03:16.720> actual<00:03:16.990> faucet<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.620> by<00:03:17.770> screwing<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.370> on

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
the actual faucet just by screwing it on

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.130 
the actual faucet just by screwing it on
and<00:03:18.760> then<00:03:19.240> this<00:03:19.420> piece<00:03:19.600> right<00:03:19.720> here<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.959> what's

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
and then this piece right here is what's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.960 
and then this piece right here is what's
going<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> tighten<00:03:20.650> everything<00:03:20.740> down<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.850> you

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
going to tighten everything down but you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.400 
going to tighten everything down but you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
it somewhat loose you pull this piece

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.670 
it somewhat loose you pull this piece
down<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:29.200> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> create<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.950> connection

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
down it's going to create the connection

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.860 
down it's going to create the connection
now<00:03:32.680> we<00:03:32.740> can<00:03:33.160> screw<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.490> a<00:03:33.580> hose<00:03:33.850> right<00:03:34.510> onto

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
now we can screw on a hose right onto

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.449 
now we can screw on a hose right onto
this<00:03:34.959> connection<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:35.650> can<00:03:35.800> screw<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> garden

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
this connection we can screw a garden

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.740 
this connection we can screw a garden
hose<00:03:36.580> right<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.000> connection<00:03:37.270> go<00:03:37.540> right

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
hose right on that connection go right

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.630 
hose right on that connection go right
in<00:03:37.810> your<00:03:37.959> garden<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:39.010> had<00:03:39.190> an<00:03:39.370> even

in your garden and if you had an even

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.990 
in your garden and if you had an even
deeper<00:03:39.850> sink<00:03:40.270> than<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.600> one

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.039 

you<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.150> we're<00:03:45.299> just<00:03:45.329> basically<00:03:45.599> showing

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
you know we're just basically showing

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.750 
you know we're just basically showing
you<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.349> we<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.769> put<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.950> filter<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.579> FA's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you that we can put a filter on the FA's

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.600 
you that we can put a filter on the FA's
head<00:03:48.090> now<00:03:48.629> if<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.170> had<00:03:49.409> a<00:03:49.439> shallower<00:03:49.920> sink

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
head now if you had a shallower sink

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.460 
head now if you had a shallower sink
than<00:03:50.819> this<00:03:50.970> which<00:03:51.689> most<00:03:51.930> people<00:03:52.290> probably

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
than this which most people probably

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.990 
than this which most people probably
would<00:03:52.980> if<00:03:53.129> they're<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.400> an<00:03:53.489> apartment<00:03:53.939> or

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
would if they're in an apartment or

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.050 
would if they're in an apartment or
condo<00:03:54.140> so<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.200> could<00:03:55.560> also<00:03:55.709> put<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
condo so you could also put that on the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180 
condo so you could also put that on the
end<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.510> garden<00:03:57.720> hose<00:03:58.110> yeah<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.920> this

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
connection itself the filter could

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.520 
connection itself the filter could
literally<00:04:03.480> be<00:04:03.750> on<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.019> other<00:04:04.170> end<00:04:04.409> of<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530

and a pump and and vinyl black hosing
and<00:04:34.289> shutoff<00:04:34.680> valves<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.370> could<00:04:35.520> actually

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
and shutoff valves you could actually

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.750 
and shutoff valves you could actually
use<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:35.910> regular<00:04:36.150> faucet<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:37.430> regular<00:04:38.430> garden
