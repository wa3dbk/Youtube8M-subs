00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.570
 how does hello mean today we have 30 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.389
 April 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 my height 708 56 days night yesterday began 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:27.630
 already cut 4 pieces cut means filed 2 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.710
 and 9 pounds but before that but 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.510
 carcass turns out somewhere 2 by 2 300 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.020
 pure normal is already the most optimal 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.660
 option I think to know what conclusion we do 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:47.340
 the very first means the most important conclusion 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:52.789
 this is what broiler roses 708 do not take 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.730
 I think it's worth starting for some reason because 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 very weeping is nekonditsiyu 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 many well here it is very literally 15 pieces 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.680
 out of fifty two kilos there is not even 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:18.330
 800 kilo 800 body 700 although I already have 6 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.549
 this is already a box mod 3 kilograms cool well and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.520
 the rest is on the way night I did not have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 never you over the past years such 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:32.579
 the difference is like this 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:35.340
 differ in weight 15 so that 12 come across those 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.790
 which were significantly different in weight but 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.880
 here and so 15 pieces with such a difference 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.040
 weights like that never him on 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 nightie is the same yellow as 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.880
 y and y Cob 500 but a lot nekonditsiyu 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.790
 whether I have such a party or the breed itself 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.960
 I don't know this, but here I am more to take these 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.560
 Rossa 708 will not mean the second is 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.610
 the fact that generally without the use of feed 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 and without the use of premix grow minimum 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.280
 30 percent slower 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:17.340
 This is definitely like not feed all 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.710
 equal to 30 percent min means if 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.320
 mean 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.010
 how to optimize to 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.430
 faster 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.420
 so I think it's worth it all the same like me 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.090
 last year did the premix apply 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.860
 it means that the premix costs 36 hryvnia. 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.180
 kilogram two kilograms on 50 chickens 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 1 pack up to 20 days is enough 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:54.510
 one pack after 20 on 4 and appetite 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.520
 them best grow better well everything better 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.520
 what do i think of the premix refuse me 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.360
 This conclusion is also about a third terminal 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.950
 this is the temperature 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.810
 This gang smeared on heating too 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.480
 I think it's not worth it because a week 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.170
 almost fell here and when it was 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.510
 cooling means it can be clearly seen as 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.980
 they grow poorly it is uniquely 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.880
 temperature must be observed means 30 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:37.170
 degrees when up to five days means 25 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.420
 degrees to 20 days and then 20 degrees 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:46.350
 then it seems to me that I must comply 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:50.640
 to mean this drinking bowl means drinking bowl 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.910
 here it is here poilochka nipple on it 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.470
 It is the best because the land does not dry 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.680
 turns over these banks 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.000
 dirt does not get anywhere it is unique 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.640
 means ventilation and dry litter 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.190
 surely no opinion no 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.420
 genius trash nor mold anything nothing 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.900
 everything 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.640
 I've been dry here for two years 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.580
 one did not die 1 here I have this year 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.340
 died tragically but no one 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.660
 died to mean because everything is dry 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.520
 everything 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.520
 no these struggles bacteria nothing 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.840
 mean potato make this year 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.230
 I started to give more potatoes I think 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.480
 what is it worth doing more adding 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.660
 potatoes when you cook porridge 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.000
 immediately together with the nets milled and 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.510
 fish value you can throw potatoes 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.230
 potatoes and then fall asleep 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.620
 grain mixture 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.260
 potatoes are beneficial they first 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.830
 already cool 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.410
 then another still the same 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:09.190
 such observation is me in this tamada 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:11.590
 sowed alfalfa grows very well here 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.200
 she already somewhere 20 centimeters and and well 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.760
 undercut soft trunks they eat well 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.330
 so whoever has the opportunity means 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.990
 alfalfa passion wild garlic and lawn 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.610
 here is a tall grass which 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.240
 light green ones not dark green leaf 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.820
 go dark green leaves like this 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:39.820
 light green high good too 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:45.330
 growing with me, too, sown too 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:50.070
 unambiguous drench it afterwards 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:53.380
 variety means everything from the kitchen 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.130
 train from four days in three or four 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.610
 days all about date broth and some there 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:05.620
 these fried fish meat 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:08.830
 oven all fats all this all you and give in 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.300
 you pour it yourself just this very 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.910
 blood crushed grain mixture wet 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.410
 mash do everything fine 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:23.560
 eating and threshing is much cheaper 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.630
 It turns out well, here they are for me here 50 pieces 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.630
 Well let's take an average of somewhere here at 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.820
 100 kg of meat is obtained means it means 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.430
 gone we haven't gone yet but somewhere 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.450
 about 300 will go away 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:41.730
 kilogram of grain grain mixture of two ground 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:45.640
 bag start 50 kilograms coby feed a 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:49.210
 that's where it is 10 kilograms of neck 20 light bulb 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:52.390
 but anyway not counting labor 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.020
 Of course, how not to twist it at times cheaper 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:07:01.390
 2 times at least cheaper than if you take 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:04.420
 it means a bird to buy, I think that makes sense 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.400
 have to do it because the feed 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:10.660
 I do not know what is the meaning 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:16.210
 deal at these prices at this price 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:18.820
 on the feed here it does not know there 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:28.690
 if the cost is out it 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:31.890
 probably good i'm so everything basically 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:36.520
 ok well here more this one here i 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:41.560
 grew 708 will not take here such 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:45.070
 mean up all thanks it was 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:48.130
 last video all i'm starting about here 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:50.380
 these here which is a little smaller here and 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:54.760
 I'm going to grow a cell here 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:59.530
 cells from here I'm starting a new batch of 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:04.290
 this aviary so all good luck to all 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.290
 My thanks to all the good
