welcome to chemical bonding part one of

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.999 
welcome to chemical bonding part one of
two<00:00:02.159> in<00:00:02.870> this<00:00:03.870> video<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> next<00:00:04.620> we're

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
two in this video in the next we're

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.289 
two in this video in the next we're
going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.190> look<00:00:05.339> at<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.640> different<00:00:06.150> elements

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
going to look at how different elements

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.950 
going to look at how different elements
join<00:00:07.080> together<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:08.160> form<00:00:08.429> compounds<00:00:09.269> which<00:00:09.780> we

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
join together to form compounds which we

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.990 
join together to form compounds which we
set<00:00:10.170> our<00:00:10.290> new<00:00:10.500> substances<00:00:11.160> with<00:00:11.820> new

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
set our new substances with new

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
set our new substances with new
properties<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:13.410> joining<00:00:14.099> together<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
properties this joining together of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.260 
properties this joining together of
elements<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.509> called<00:00:16.199> bonding<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:18.000> first

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
elements is called bonding in this first

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.970 
elements is called bonding in this first
part<00:00:18.510> we're<00:00:18.779> going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> focus<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> bonding

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
part we're going to focus on the bonding

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
part we're going to focus on the bonding
that<00:00:20.010> occurs<00:00:20.490> between<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.300> metal<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
that occurs between a metal and a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.040 
that occurs between a metal and a
nonmetal<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.680> let's<00:00:23.189> look<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.490> an<00:00:23.609> example<00:00:24.050> we

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
nonmetal so let's look at an example we

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.700 
nonmetal so let's look at an example we
have<00:00:25.310> sodium<00:00:26.310> which<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.849> metal<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
have sodium which is in metal and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
have sodium which is in metal and
chlorine<00:00:28.710> put<00:00:29.699> together<00:00:30.090> make<00:00:30.480> sodium

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
chlorine put together make sodium

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.580 
chlorine put together make sodium
chloride<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.769> table<00:00:32.130> salt<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> what's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
chloride or table salt so what's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.010 
chloride or table salt so what's
happening<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> bond<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.809> let's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
happening with the bond here but let's

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.569 
happening with the bond here but let's
look<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.290> these<00:00:37.410> elements<00:00:37.620> separately<00:00:38.309> we

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
look at these elements separately we

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.380 
look at these elements separately we
have<00:00:38.700> na<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.800> CL<00:00:41.309> sodium<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
have na and we have CL sodium and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.930 
have na and we have CL sodium and
chlorine<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:44.520> I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> do

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
chlorine the first thing I'm going to do

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
chlorine the first thing I'm going to do
is<00:00:45.180> look<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.510> their<00:00:45.690> valence<00:00:45.960> electrons

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is look at their valence electrons

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.740 
is look at their valence electrons
because<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> valence<00:00:47.579> electrons<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
because the valence electrons are the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.119 
because the valence electrons are the
ones<00:00:48.780> they're<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.469> involved<00:00:50.039> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
ones they're going to be involved in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
ones they're going to be involved in
bonding<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.660> sodium<00:00:52.050> has<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.350> valence

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
bonding so if sodium has one valence

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
bonding so if sodium has one valence
electron<00:00:53.899> chlorine<00:00:54.899> has<00:00:55.320> seven<00:00:58.940> there's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
electron chlorine has seven there's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
electron chlorine has seven there's
chlorines<00:01:00.510> valence<00:01:00.870> electrons<00:01:01.289> drawn<00:01:01.649> in

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
chlorines valence electrons drawn in

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.920 
chlorines valence electrons drawn in
that's<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.370> first<00:01:02.640> step<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.510> where<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> go

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that's my first step now where to go

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
that's my first step now where to go
from<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> octet

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
from here well I know from the octet

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
from here well I know from the octet
rule<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.100> elements<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.150> full

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
rule that all elements want a full

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
rule that all elements want a full
valence<00:01:09.869> shell<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.799> want<00:01:11.100> eight

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
valence shell they all want eight

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.620 
valence shell they all want eight
valence<00:01:11.670> electrons

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
valence electrons

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
valence electrons
the<00:01:13.320> next<00:01:13.590> thing<00:01:13.740> I'm<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.460> look

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the next thing I'm going to do is look

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.219 
the next thing I'm going to do is look
at<00:01:14.939> those<00:01:15.119> valence<00:01:15.330> electrons<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.049> more

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
at those valence electrons in more

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.620 
at those valence electrons in more
detail<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.310> we're<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> write<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> spdf

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
detail so we're going to write the spdf

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.749 
detail so we're going to write the spdf
electron<00:01:19.380> configuration<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.159> each<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
electron configuration for each one of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
electron configuration for each one of
these<00:01:20.990> sodium<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.380> 1s2<00:01:23.299> 2s2<00:01:24.350> 2p6<00:01:25.549> 3s1<00:01:27.409> chlorine

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
these sodium is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1 chlorine

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
these sodium is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1 chlorine
is<00:01:28.880> 1s2<00:01:30.079> 2s2<00:01:31.310> 2p6<00:01:32.659> 3s2<00:01:34.040> 3p5<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> how<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.630> get

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5 so how can I get

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.679 
is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5 so how can I get
these<00:01:37.079> both<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.189> eight<00:01:38.670> electrons<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
these both to have eight electrons in

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.819 
these both to have eight electrons in
their<00:01:40.229> outermost<00:01:40.619> s<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.549> key<00:01:41.850> sub<00:01:42.360> levels

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
their outermost s and key sub levels

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.819 
their outermost s and key sub levels
well<00:01:43.829> here's<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:45.200> sodium<00:01:46.200> can

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
well here's what I can do sodium can

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.960 
well here's what I can do sodium can
give<00:01:47.250> its<00:01:48.149> electron<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.409> chlorine<00:01:49.970> or

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
give its electron to chlorine or

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
give its electron to chlorine or
chlorine<00:01:51.000> takes<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.229> sodium<00:01:52.680> whichever

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
chlorine takes it from sodium whichever

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770 
chlorine takes it from sodium whichever
way<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.189> want<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> look<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.540> here's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
way you want to look at it but here's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.709 
way you want to look at it but here's
what<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> does<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.700> sodium<00:01:56.700> loses<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.420> one

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
what that does if sodium loses that one

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.069 
what that does if sodium loses that one
electron<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.469> loses<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> three<00:01:59.219> s<00:01:59.399> one<00:02:00.079> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
electron it loses the three s one that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.730 
electron it loses the three s one that
puts<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.799> full<00:02:02.990> second<00:02:03.990> principle

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
puts it at a full second principle

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
puts it at a full second principle
energy<00:02:04.890> level<00:02:05.340> s<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.180> P<00:02:06.360> sub<00:02:06.630> levels<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.469> two

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
energy level s and P sub levels so two

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.820 
energy level s and P sub levels so two
and<00:02:07.860> six<00:02:08.340> eight<00:02:08.610> total<00:02:09.270> valence<00:02:09.479> electrons<00:02:10.140> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and six eight total valence electrons so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.480 
and six eight total valence electrons so
sodium<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> good<00:02:11.610> now

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
sodium is good now

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.700 
sodium is good now
chlorine<00:02:13.120> something<00:02:13.930> similar<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:14.410> happen

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
chlorine something similar will happen

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.180 
chlorine something similar will happen
we<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.460> from<00:02:15.640> 3<00:02:15.970> P<00:02:16.180> 5<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:18.040> 3<00:02:18.310> P<00:02:18.520> 6<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.480> now<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
we go from 3 P 5 to 3 P 6 and now the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.970 
we go from 3 P 5 to 3 P 6 and now the
third<00:02:21.580> principle<00:02:22.150> energy<00:02:22.270> level<00:02:22.690> s<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.470> P<00:02:23.680> sub

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
third principle energy level s and P sub

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.330 
third principle energy level s and P sub
levels<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.550> full<00:02:25.120> 2<00:02:25.720> &amp;<00:02:25.960> 6<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:26.530> 8<00:02:27.040> valence

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
levels are full 2 &amp; 6 or 8 valence

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.240 
levels are full 2 &amp; 6 or 8 valence
electrons<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.750> these<00:02:28.870> both<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.530> 8<00:02:29.830> valence

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
electrons so these both have 8 valence

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.160 
electrons so these both have 8 valence
electrons<00:02:30.520> which<00:02:31.510> means<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.990> they<00:02:32.140> are

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
electrons which means that they are

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.410 
electrons which means that they are
satisfied<00:02:32.650> they<00:02:33.280> both<00:02:33.520> satisfy<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.180> octet

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
satisfied they both satisfy the octet

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.540 
satisfied they both satisfy the octet
rule<00:02:34.690> we<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.740> represent<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.490> with

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
rule we can represent this with

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.730 
rule we can represent this with
something<00:02:37.090> called<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.570> lewis<00:02:39.180> structure<00:02:40.180> for

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
something called a lewis structure for

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.770 
something called a lewis structure for
the<00:02:41.740> entire<00:02:42.010> compound<00:02:42.610> which<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.300> different

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the entire compound which is different

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.020 
the entire compound which is different
from<00:02:43.930> these<00:02:44.140> Lewis<00:02:44.590> dot<00:02:44.860> structures<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.850> we

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
from these Lewis dot structures that we

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.600 
from these Lewis dot structures that we
just<00:02:46.300> did<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.780> individual<00:02:47.320> elements<00:02:47.610> so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
just did for the individual elements so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.710 
just did for the individual elements so
let's<00:02:48.760> take<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> look<00:02:49.150> at<00:02:49.240> what<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.420> Lewis

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
let's take a look at what the Lewis

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.840 
let's take a look at what the Lewis
structure<00:02:50.050> looks<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.350> for<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.800> I'm<00:02:51.430> going

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
structure looks like for this I'm going

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.510 
structure looks like for this I'm going
to<00:02:51.940> start<00:02:52.240> by<00:02:52.420> writing<00:02:52.690> sodium<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.620> brackets

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
to start by writing sodium in brackets

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.850 
to start by writing sodium in brackets
and<00:02:56.280> sodium<00:02:57.280> lost<00:02:57.640> an<00:02:57.970> electron<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.410> has<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
and sodium lost an electron so it has a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.130 
and sodium lost an electron so it has a
single<00:03:00.280> positive<00:03:00.640> charge<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.900> lost

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
single positive charge because it lost

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.770 
single positive charge because it lost
that<00:03:02.320> one<00:03:02.680> negative<00:03:03.190> electron<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.570> write

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
that one negative electron so I write

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.380 
that one negative electron so I write
the<00:03:04.900> charge<00:03:05.110> in<00:03:05.380> here<00:03:05.710> then<00:03:06.640> right<00:03:06.850> next<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.270> it

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the charge in here then right next to it

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.540 
the charge in here then right next to it
I'm<00:03:07.660> going<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.110> put<00:03:08.320> chlorine<00:03:08.740> in<00:03:09.070> brackets

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
I'm going to put chlorine in brackets

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.820 
I'm going to put chlorine in brackets
and<00:03:11.280> chlorine<00:03:12.360> has<00:03:13.360> 8<00:03:13.750> dots<00:03:14.110> now<00:03:14.380> because<00:03:14.710> it

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
and chlorine has 8 dots now because it

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.880 
and chlorine has 8 dots now because it
took<00:03:14.980> sodium's<00:03:15.670> one<00:03:16.090> electron<00:03:16.870> dot<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.830> I'm

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
took sodium's one electron dot so I'm

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.970 
took sodium's one electron dot so I'm
going<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.100> draw<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.460> chlorines<00:03:19.030> eight<00:03:19.980> valence

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
going to draw in chlorines eight valence

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.330 
going to draw in chlorines eight valence
electron<00:03:21.640> dots<00:03:22.140> sodium<00:03:23.140> I'm<00:03:23.320> leaving<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.980> zero

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
electron dots sodium I'm leaving a zero

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.580 
electron dots sodium I'm leaving a zero
because<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.120> really<00:03:25.420> has<00:03:25.570> an<00:03:25.720> empty<00:03:26.140> one<00:03:26.380> that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
because it really has an empty one that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.710 
because it really has an empty one that
it<00:03:26.680> abandoned<00:03:27.280> when<00:03:27.460> it<00:03:27.550> lost<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.180> electron

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
it abandoned when it lost this electron

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.010 
it abandoned when it lost this electron
and<00:03:29.100> chlorine<00:03:30.100> has<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.340> negative<00:03:30.760> charge

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
and chlorine has a negative charge

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.260 
and chlorine has a negative charge
because<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.050> gained<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.560> negative<00:03:32.890> electron<00:03:33.340> so

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
because it gained a negative electron so

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.020 
because it gained a negative electron so
this<00:03:34.450> Lewis<00:03:34.930> structure<00:03:35.260> tells<00:03:36.220> us<00:03:36.490> a<00:03:36.700> couple

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
this Lewis structure tells us a couple

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.890 
this Lewis structure tells us a couple
things<00:03:37.740> first<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:39.430> these<00:03:39.730> became<00:03:40.270> ions

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
things first that these became ions

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.280 
things first that these became ions
sodium<00:03:41.830> is<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> positive<00:03:42.850> ion<00:03:43.110> chlorines<00:03:44.110> a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
sodium is a positive ion chlorines a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.100 
sodium is a positive ion chlorines a
negative<00:03:44.680> ion<00:03:45.540> what's<00:03:46.540> keeping<00:03:47.020> them

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
negative ion what's keeping them

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.110 
negative ion what's keeping them
together<00:03:47.290> well<00:03:48.070> it's<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.460> attraction

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
together well it's the attraction

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.940 
together well it's the attraction
between<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.870> positive<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.740> the<00:03:50.920> negative

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
between the positive and the negative

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.520 
between the positive and the negative
charges<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:52.390> attraction<00:03:53.050> between<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
charges this attraction between the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.590 
charges this attraction between the
positive<00:03:54.040> charge<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.550> positive<00:03:55.060> ion<00:03:55.360> and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
positive charge of the positive ion and

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.220 
positive charge of the positive ion and
the<00:03:56.020> negative<00:03:56.500> charge<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.310> negative<00:03:57.850> ion

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the negative charge of the negative ion

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.930 
the negative charge of the negative ion
results<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.350> what<00:03:59.530> we<00:03:59.650> call<00:03:59.920> an<00:04:00.160> ionic<00:04:00.640> bond

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
results in what we call an ionic bond

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.660 
results in what we call an ionic bond
now<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.810> sample<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.380> salt<00:04:02.740> we're<00:04:03.370> not<00:04:03.550> going

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
now in a sample of salt we're not going

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.960 
now in a sample of salt we're not going
to<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:03.880> just<00:04:04.240> one<00:04:04.560> sodium<00:04:05.560> atom<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.700> one

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
to have just one sodium atom and in one

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.000 
to have just one sodium atom and in one
chlorine<00:04:07.510> atom<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:08.350> going<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> be<00:04:08.740> a<00:04:08.770> whole

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
chlorine atom is going to be a whole

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.490 
chlorine atom is going to be a whole
bunch<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.370> them<00:04:09.550> so<00:04:10.240> there's<00:04:10.990> actually<00:04:11.260> a

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
bunch of them so there's actually a

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.130 
bunch of them so there's actually a
little<00:04:11.650> bit<00:04:11.800> more<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:12.220> interaction

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
little bit more to this interaction

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.140 
little bit more to this interaction
table<00:04:14.140> salt<00:04:14.380> sodium<00:04:14.830> chloride<00:04:15.010> does<00:04:15.910> not

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
table salt sodium chloride does not

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.900 
table salt sodium chloride does not
exist<00:04:16.660> as<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:17.260> two<00:04:17.500> atoms<00:04:17.950> bound<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.760> each

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
exist as just two atoms bound to each

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.030 
exist as just two atoms bound to each
other<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.960> actually<00:04:20.440> looks<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.770> little<00:04:20.799> bit

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
other it actually looks a little bit

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.850 
other it actually looks a little bit
like<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.730> so<00:04:22.060> this<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.930> crystal<00:04:23.410> structure

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
like this so this is a crystal structure

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.909 
like this so this is a crystal structure
and<00:04:24.040> in<00:04:24.940> fact

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
and in fact

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.550 
and in fact
the<00:04:26.280> crystal<00:04:26.699> structure<00:04:27.090> results<00:04:27.719> from<00:04:28.349> those

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
the crystal structure results from those

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.540 
the crystal structure results from those
positive<00:04:29.159> and<00:04:29.370> negative<00:04:29.729> charges<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
positive and negative charges the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.110 
positive and negative charges the
smaller<00:04:32.939> blue<00:04:33.360> circles<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.229> this<00:04:34.620> diagram

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
smaller blue circles in this diagram

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.059 
smaller blue circles in this diagram
represent<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.240> sodium<00:04:36.689> ions<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.770> these<00:04:37.889> are

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
represent the sodium ions so these are

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.659 
represent the sodium ions so these are
all<00:04:38.219> positively<00:04:39.120> charged<00:04:39.860> positive<00:04:40.860> positive

all positively charged positive positive
positive<00:04:42.349> positive<00:04:43.349> positive<00:04:44.189> so<00:04:44.759> on<00:04:44.909> so

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
positive positive positive so on so

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.529 
positive positive positive so on so
forth<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:46.080> get<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.319> idea<00:04:46.879> what<00:04:47.879> happens<00:04:48.300> is

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
forth you get the idea what happens is

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.379 
forth you get the idea what happens is
that<00:04:48.749> each<00:04:49.379> positive<00:04:49.889> charge<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.819> attracted

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
that each positive charge is attracted

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.200 
that each positive charge is attracted
to<00:04:51.509> a<00:04:51.539> negative<00:04:51.749> charge<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:52.529> is<00:04:53.520> surrounding

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
to a negative charge that is surrounding

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.879 
to a negative charge that is surrounding
it<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.650> if<00:04:55.650> we<00:04:55.770> look<00:04:56.039> at<00:04:56.840> for<00:04:57.840> example<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.620> one

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
it so if we look at for example this one

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.890 
it so if we look at for example this one
right<00:04:59.099> here<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.669> I'm<00:05:00.060> hovering<00:05:00.479> my<00:05:00.870> mouse

right here and I'm hovering my mouse

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.230 
right here and I'm hovering my mouse
around<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.560> positive<00:05:02.189> charge<00:05:02.520> it's

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
around this positive charge it's

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.230 
around this positive charge it's
surrounded<00:05:03.810> by<00:05:03.990> this<00:05:04.050> negative<00:05:04.830> charge<00:05:05.240> this

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
surrounded by this negative charge this

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.550 
surrounded by this negative charge this
negative<00:05:06.689> charge<00:05:06.960> this<00:05:07.889> one<00:05:08.159> and<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:09.120> one

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
negative charge this one and this one

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.379 
negative charge this one and this one
now<00:05:10.590> this<00:05:11.039> negative<00:05:11.520> charge<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:12.060> also

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
now this negative charge is also

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.350 
now this negative charge is also
surrounded<00:05:12.990> by<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.229> positive<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:14.240> positive<00:05:15.240> this

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
structure is going to be very important

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.429 
structure is going to be very important
the<00:05:27.150> salt<00:05:27.449> was<00:05:27.599> a<00:05:27.629> fairly<00:05:27.930> simple<00:05:28.349> example

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
the salt was a fairly simple example

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.369 
the salt was a fairly simple example
let's<00:05:29.430> look<00:05:29.490> at<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:29.789> second<00:05:30.120> example

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
let's look at the second example

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.360 
let's look at the second example
especially<00:05:31.379> in<00:05:31.469> terms<00:05:31.589> of<00:05:31.830> how<00:05:31.889> to<00:05:32.039> draw<00:05:32.339> a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
lewis structure for this let's look at

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.800 
lewis structure for this let's look at
magnesium<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:37.099> fluorine<00:05:38.180> okay<00:05:39.180> these<00:05:39.750> two

magnesium and fluorine okay these two

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.839 
magnesium and fluorine okay these two
elements<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.500> we'll<00:05:40.650> see<00:05:40.860> what<00:05:41.250> kind<00:05:41.399> of<00:05:41.550> bond

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
elements and we'll see what kind of bond

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.639 
elements and we'll see what kind of bond
they<00:05:42.000> form<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.509> how<00:05:42.629> they<00:05:42.810> form<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.169> bond<00:05:43.409> and

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649 
they form and how they form a bond and

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:45.559 
they form and how they form a bond and
how<00:05:44.279> we<00:05:44.339> can<00:05:44.610> draw<00:05:44.819> the<00:05:44.879> lewis<00:05:45.210> structure<00:05:45.449> for

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
how we can draw the lewis structure for

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.379 
how we can draw the lewis structure for
them<00:05:46.099> magnesium<00:05:47.099> has<00:05:47.339> two<00:05:47.879> valence<00:05:48.149> electrons

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
them magnesium has two valence electrons

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:58.399 
them magnesium has two valence electrons
fluorine<00:05:51.389> has<00:05:51.659> seven<00:05:56.839> fluorine<00:05:57.839> can<00:05:58.110> reach

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
fluorine has seven fluorine can reach

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.529 
fluorine has seven fluorine can reach
eight<00:05:58.649> valence<00:05:58.979> electrons<00:05:59.699> to<00:05:59.969> satisfy<00:06:00.479> the

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
eight valence electrons to satisfy the

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.659 
eight valence electrons to satisfy the
octet<00:06:00.719> rule<00:06:01.080> if<00:06:01.560> it<00:06:02.219> takes<00:06:02.580> one<00:06:03.509> of<00:06:03.539> magnesiums

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
octet rule if it takes one of magnesiums

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.850 
octet rule if it takes one of magnesiums
electrons<00:06:05.719> but<00:06:06.719> that<00:06:06.870> leaves<00:06:07.080> magnesium<00:06:07.680> was

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
electrons but that leaves magnesium was

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.339 
electrons but that leaves magnesium was
still<00:06:08.159> one<00:06:08.430> electron<00:06:08.849> left<00:06:09.120> so<00:06:09.389> magnesium<00:06:09.689> has

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
still one electron left so magnesium has

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.040 
still one electron left so magnesium has
not<00:06:10.710> reached<00:06:11.069> a<00:06:11.430> full<00:06:12.089> valence<00:06:12.240> shell<00:06:12.539> and

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
not reached a full valence shell and

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.260 
not reached a full valence shell and
needs<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:13.680> get<00:06:13.919> rid<00:06:14.159> of<00:06:14.189> this<00:06:14.550> other<00:06:14.789> electron

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
needs to get rid of this other electron

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.300 
needs to get rid of this other electron
somehow<00:06:15.719> and<00:06:15.960> it<00:06:16.469> can't<00:06:16.740> give<00:06:17.009> it<00:06:17.099> to<00:06:17.129> this

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
somehow and it can't give it to this

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.070 
somehow and it can't give it to this
fluorine<00:06:17.759> because<00:06:17.939> the<00:06:18.180> fluorine<00:06:18.599> is<00:06:18.719> already

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
fluorine because the fluorine is already

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.760 
fluorine because the fluorine is already
at<00:06:19.169> eight<00:06:19.379> so<00:06:20.099> what<00:06:20.610> happens<00:06:21.000> now<00:06:21.210> well<00:06:21.960> what

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
at eight so what happens now well what

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.010 
at eight so what happens now well what
we<00:06:22.949> can<00:06:23.129> do<00:06:23.339> is<00:06:23.639> realize<00:06:24.360> that<00:06:24.599> there's<00:06:24.779> more

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
we can do is realize that there's more

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.679 
we can do is realize that there's more
than<00:06:25.080> one<00:06:25.289> fluorine<00:06:25.860> present<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:26.729> so<00:06:27.419> if

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
than one fluorine present and so if

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.409 
than one fluorine present and so if
there's<00:06:27.899> another<00:06:28.169> fluorine<00:06:28.560> nearby<00:06:29.069> one<00:06:30.060> two

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
there's another fluorine nearby one two

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.679 
there's another fluorine nearby one two
three<00:06:30.839> four<00:06:31.110> five<00:06:31.409> six<00:06:31.680> seven<00:06:32.509> electrons<00:06:33.509> on

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
three four five six seven electrons on

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.469 
three four five six seven electrons on
that<00:06:33.839> fluorine<00:06:34.139> it<00:06:34.919> will<00:06:35.190> take<00:06:35.459> the<00:06:35.849> remaining

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
that fluorine it will take the remaining

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.180 
that fluorine it will take the remaining
electron<00:06:37.019> for<00:06:37.259> magnesium

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
electron for magnesium

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.310 
electron for magnesium
so<00:06:38.700> we're<00:06:38.910> going<00:06:39.000> to<00:06:39.060> get<00:06:39.300> this<00:06:39.510> one<00:06:39.780> going

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
so we're going to get this one going

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.400 
so we're going to get this one going
that<00:06:40.830> way<00:06:41.090> now<00:06:42.090> magnesium<00:06:42.720> has<00:06:42.840> lost<00:06:43.110> these

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
that way now magnesium has lost these

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.990 
that way now magnesium has lost these
two<00:06:43.650> so<00:06:43.920> it's<00:06:44.100> going<00:06:44.250> to<00:06:44.310> be<00:06:44.460> at<00:06:44.640> a<00:06:44.670> full

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
two so it's going to be at a full

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.840 
two so it's going to be at a full
valence<00:06:45.210> shell<00:06:45.510> for<00:06:46.110> the<00:06:46.200> next<00:06:46.580> inside<00:06:47.580> layer

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
valence shell for the next inside layer

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.090 
valence shell for the next inside layer
of<00:06:47.970> electrons<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.690> each<00:06:49.620> one<00:06:49.860> of<00:06:49.890> these

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
of electrons and each one of these

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.150 
of electrons and each one of these
fluorines<00:06:50.730> is<00:06:50.970> at<00:06:51.480> eight<00:06:51.750> to<00:06:52.350> satisfy<00:06:52.800> octet

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
fluorines is at eight to satisfy octet

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.190 
fluorines is at eight to satisfy octet
rules<00:06:53.370> for<00:06:53.610> themselves<00:06:53.970> the<00:06:54.630> only<00:06:54.840> question

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
rules for themselves the only question

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.930 
rules for themselves the only question
remaining<00:06:55.530> is<00:06:55.800> how<00:06:55.980> do<00:06:56.040> we<00:06:56.160> represent<00:06:56.400> this

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
remaining is how do we represent this

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.390 
remaining is how do we represent this
with<00:06:57.120> a<00:06:57.150> Lewis<00:06:57.450> structure<00:06:57.980> so<00:06:58.980> let's<00:06:59.010> do<00:06:59.370> that

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
with a Lewis structure so let's do that

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.090 
with a Lewis structure so let's do that
I'm<00:06:59.820> doing<00:07:00.420> the<00:07:00.630> mg<00:07:01.050> first<00:07:01.380> because<00:07:01.860> that's

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
I'm doing the mg first because that's

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.060 
I'm doing the mg first because that's
the<00:07:02.370> positive<00:07:03.030> ion<00:07:03.420> the<00:07:03.990> cation<00:07:04.500> always<00:07:04.830> comes

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
the positive ion the cation always comes

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.510 
the positive ion the cation always comes
first<00:07:06.350> now<00:07:07.350> what's<00:07:07.590> the<00:07:07.710> charge<00:07:07.920> on<00:07:08.190> magnesium

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
first now what's the charge on magnesium

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.450 
first now what's the charge on magnesium
well<00:07:09.030> it<00:07:09.210> lost<00:07:09.480> two<00:07:09.840> electrons<00:07:10.380> so<00:07:11.220> it's<00:07:11.370> going

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
well it lost two electrons so it's going

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.580 
well it lost two electrons so it's going
to<00:07:11.550> have<00:07:11.640> a<00:07:11.820> positive<00:07:12.420> two<00:07:12.630> charge<00:07:12.660> or<00:07:13.320> two

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
to have a positive two charge or two

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.970 
to have a positive two charge or two
plus<00:07:13.890> charge<00:07:14.870> I'm<00:07:15.870> also<00:07:16.230> not<00:07:16.530> going<00:07:16.680> to<00:07:16.740> draw

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
plus charge I'm also not going to draw

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.920 
plus charge I'm also not going to draw
any<00:07:17.160> dots<00:07:17.490> around<00:07:17.730> magnesium<00:07:18.450> because<00:07:18.600> it

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
any dots around magnesium because it

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.990 
any dots around magnesium because it
lost<00:07:19.200> both<00:07:19.650> of<00:07:19.680> its<00:07:20.040> original<00:07:20.580> valence

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
lost both of its original valence

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.680 
lost both of its original valence
electrons<00:07:22.760> next<00:07:23.760> I<00:07:23.940> need<00:07:24.030> to<00:07:24.090> represent<00:07:24.360> the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
electrons next I need to represent the

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.470 
electrons next I need to represent the
fluorine<00:07:25.220> so<00:07:26.220> let's<00:07:26.580> put<00:07:26.790> that<00:07:26.820> in<00:07:26.970> we<00:07:27.360> have

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480 
fluorine so let's put that in we have

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.870 
fluorine so let's put that in we have
fluorine<00:07:27.990> and<00:07:29.870> it<00:07:30.870> has<00:07:31.080> one<00:07:31.650> two<00:07:32.190> three<00:07:32.220> four

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
fluorine and it has one two three four

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.840 
fluorine and it has one two three four
five<00:07:33.810> six<00:07:34.350> seven<00:07:34.860> eight<00:07:35.190> valence<00:07:35.640> electrons

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
five six seven eight valence electrons

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.030 
five six seven eight valence electrons
because<00:07:36.810> I<00:07:36.840> gained<00:07:37.170> one<00:07:37.410> to<00:07:37.590> have<00:07:37.710> the<00:07:37.830> full

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040 
because I gained one to have the full

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.310 
because I gained one to have the full
eight<00:07:38.300> it<00:07:39.300> has<00:07:39.450> a<00:07:39.480> negative<00:07:39.870> one<00:07:40.290> charge

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320 
eight it has a negative one charge

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.820 
eight it has a negative one charge
because<00:07:41.160> it<00:07:41.190> gained<00:07:41.520> one<00:07:41.820> electron<00:07:42.500> but<00:07:43.500> there

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830 
because it gained one electron but there

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.860 
because it gained one electron but there
are<00:07:43.980> two<00:07:44.250> fluorines<00:07:44.970> so<00:07:45.510> I'm<00:07:45.660> going<00:07:45.840> to

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
are two fluorines so I'm going to

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.810 
are two fluorines so I'm going to
represent<00:07:46.410> that<00:07:46.590> by<00:07:46.800> putting<00:07:47.490> a<00:07:47.790> large<00:07:48.180> two<00:07:48.690> in

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:49.820 
represent that by putting a large two in

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.220 
represent that by putting a large two in
front<00:07:50.820> of<00:07:51.060> the<00:07:51.180> bracket<00:07:51.570> with<00:07:51.690> the<00:07:51.720> fluorines

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.230 
front of the bracket with the fluorines

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.620 
front of the bracket with the fluorines
what<00:07:52.890> this<00:07:53.070> tells<00:07:53.400> me<00:07:53.490> is<00:07:53.760> that<00:07:54.240> for<00:07:54.390> every

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630 
what this tells me is that for every

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.200 
what this tells me is that for every
magnesium<00:07:55.530> ion<00:07:55.919> in<00:07:56.250> magnesium<00:07:56.940> fluoride

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.210 
magnesium ion in magnesium fluoride

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.950 
magnesium ion in magnesium fluoride
there<00:07:57.990> are<00:07:58.200> two<00:07:58.700> negative<00:07:59.700> fluorine<00:08:00.330> ions<00:08:00.660> and

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 
there are two negative fluorine ions and

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.810 
there are two negative fluorine ions and
the<00:08:01.620> crystal<00:08:02.010> structure<00:08:02.370> that<00:08:02.400> this

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:02.820 
the crystal structure that this

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.310 
the crystal structure that this
substance<00:08:03.360> makes<00:08:03.600> would<00:08:04.140> reflect<00:08:04.500> that<00:08:04.740> ratio
