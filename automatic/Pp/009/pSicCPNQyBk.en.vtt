00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
left-handed which is actually good for

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.400 
left-handed which is actually good for
you<00:02:41.880> writers<00:02:42.269> out<00:02:42.390> there<00:02:42.660> because<00:02:43.019> then<00:02:43.260> it's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
you writers out there because then it's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.250 
you writers out there because then it's
a<00:02:43.470> mirror<00:02:43.680> image<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:45.989> my

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
a mirror image so this is one of my

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
a mirror image so this is one of my
signature<00:02:46.560> moves<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> most

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
signature moves it's not the most

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.490 
signature moves it's not the most
complicated<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> definitely

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
complicated but it's definitely

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.190 
complicated but it's definitely
effective<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.970> involves<00:02:51.420> basic<00:02:51.930> rock<00:02:52.170> beat

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
effective it involves basic rock beat

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.190 
effective it involves basic rock beat
