 hi i'm francesco welcome to my kitchen 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.289
 today bicycles cost to make a karaoke very very simple that not 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.539
 requires the use of the oven 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.250
 for now for a while pray so republic keith cooked earlier in 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.640
 other occasions 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.659
 go love it's cooking all to me right 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.069
 this is because it could be called capcake 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.939
 find out here why 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.040
 but we don't get ice cream capcakes 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.230
 1 2 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.350
 happy day 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.650
 let's see max and directives for this time that I also have to because e 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.829
 these are so many that I leave 1 employee for what I need 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.330
 a little consists 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.240
 with the help of the spoon 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.970
 places where disco 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.800
 within the ikea cache 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.740
 chocolate makes me practically try to line the bottom figured 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.150
 recorded after about 15 22 shoot down that Latin monster 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.030
 here it is, covered in chocolate 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.600
 and diana let's say another junta so let's do another little tour like this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.570
 maybe I love you 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.060
 if we left a few holes 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 or at least 2 make sure this 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 will be our pilot if for if 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 he thinks that then the card will be eliminated and consequently 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.650
 that's why the hair is called eats everything 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.690
 because they practically eat everything 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.060
 even what they wear looks more like brown shots 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.180
 therefore it is necessary to do a good job 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 and cover any qq 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.920

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.319
 and if all goes well, mystery rainbow holds us 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.009

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.469
