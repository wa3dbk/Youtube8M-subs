conceptualize time an astrology is about

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.700 
conceptualize time an astrology is about
time<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.930> are<00:02:08.110> uptime<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.250> downtime<00:02:10.710> is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
time there are uptime and downtime is

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.840 
time there are uptime and downtime is
everyone<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.850> control<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.660> one's<00:02:13.900> uptime

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
everyone in control of one's uptime

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.410 
everyone in control of one's uptime
downtime<00:02:15.850> now<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> who<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:17.980> control<00:02:18.300> who<00:02:19.300> is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
downtime now so who is in control who is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.360 
downtime now so who is in control who is
in<00:02:20.020> control<00:02:20.230> or<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.520> planets<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:24.100> when<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
in control or the planets so when the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.230 
in control or the planets so when the
planets<00:02:24.790> are<00:02:25.090> running<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:27.040> favorable<00:02:27.970> time

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
planets are running a favorable time

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.890 
planets are running a favorable time
then<00:02:28.630> everything<00:02:29.440> works<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.760> then<00:02:31.390> when<00:02:31.600> just

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
then everything works and then when just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.930 
then everything works and then when just
you<00:02:32.230> move<00:02:32.530> into<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:33.280> very<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:34.090> bad<00:02:34.900> time<00:02:35.260> then

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
you move into a very a bad time then

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.640 
you move into a very a bad time then
nothing<00:02:36.940> works

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
nothing works

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.240 
nothing works
this<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.820> your<00:02:39.880> own<00:02:40.420> life<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
this you can see in your own life and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.150 
this you can see in your own life and
one<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.430> even<00:02:42.760> study<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:44.800> research

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.840 

uptime<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.400> downtime<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:49.420> relation<00:02:50.020> to

a scientific approach but simply to say
that<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:10.269> are<00:03:10.620> really<00:03:11.970> giving<00:03:12.970> powers<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.810> the

but then the Yogi's had perfected their
consciousness<00:06:40.790> they<00:06:41.210> could<00:06:41.480> see<00:06:42.080> very<00:06:43.040> easily

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
consciousness they could see very easily

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.800 
consciousness they could see very easily
that<00:06:45.370> this<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.520> what<00:06:46.700> is<00:06:46.820> going<00:06:47.030> to<00:06:47.150> happen<00:06:47.420> at

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
that this is what is going to happen at

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.850 
that this is what is going to happen at
this<00:06:48.110> particular<00:06:48.520> second<00:06:49.520> or<00:06:50.510> even<00:06:50.860> smaller

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
this particular second or even smaller

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.130 
this particular second or even smaller
divisions<00:06:52.220> of<00:06:52.610> a<00:06:52.730> second<00:06:53.150> because<00:06:53.660> the<00:06:53.930> time

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
divisions of a second because the time

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.030 
divisions of a second because the time
matrix<00:06:55.120> in<00:06:56.120> yoga<00:06:56.630> is<00:06:56.930> very<00:06:57.620> very

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
matrix in yoga is very very

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.940 
matrix in yoga is very very
sophisticated<00:06:58.420> and<00:06:59.420> then<00:07:00.320> they<00:07:00.500> could<00:07:00.710> go

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
sophisticated and then they could go

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.220 
sophisticated and then they could go
into<00:07:02.350> very<00:07:03.350> very<00:07:03.500> smallest<00:07:04.190> minuscule<00:07:05.230> units

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
into very very smallest minuscule units

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.770 
into very very smallest minuscule units
of<00:07:06.440> time<00:07:06.710> and<00:07:07.130> understand<00:07:08.030> it<00:07:08.210> and<00:07:08.390> relate<00:07:08.720> it

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 
of time and understand it and relate it

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.380 
of time and understand it and relate it
to<00:07:08.960> the<00:07:09.200> planets<00:07:09.910> so<00:07:10.910> that's<00:07:11.120> the<00:07:11.240> most

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
to the planets so that's the most

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.440 
to the planets so that's the most
important<00:07:11.900> thing<00:07:12.110> even<00:07:12.400> a<00:07:13.400> second<00:07:14.500> even<00:07:15.500> a

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
important thing even a second even a

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.870 
important thing even a second even a
division<00:07:17.450> of<00:07:17.570> a<00:07:17.690> second<00:07:18.080> their<00:07:18.880> 100th

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
division of a second their 100th

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.850 
division of a second their 100th
division<00:07:20.390> or<00:07:20.570> a<00:07:20.600> thousands<00:07:21.200> the<00:07:21.320> division<00:07:21.740> of

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
division or a thousands the division of

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.680 
division or a thousands the division of
a<00:07:21.980> second<00:07:22.370> is<00:07:22.790> also<00:07:23.660> governed<00:07:24.410> by<00:07:24.620> planners<00:07:25.690> so

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
a second is also governed by planners so

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.820 
a second is also governed by planners so
you<00:07:27.640> you<00:07:28.640> have<00:07:28.670> to<00:07:29.210> have<00:07:29.810> a<00:07:30.110> scientific

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
you you have to have a scientific

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.810 
you you have to have a scientific
approach<00:07:31.370> to<00:07:32.110> the<00:07:33.110> problem<00:07:33.590> and<00:07:33.800> simply<00:07:34.550> not

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820 
approach to the problem and simply not

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.720 
approach to the problem and simply not
accept<00:07:35.540> that<00:07:36.170> you<00:07:36.410> are<00:07:36.440> giving<00:07:36.980> power<00:07:37.370> to<00:07:37.550> the

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
accept that you are giving power to the

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:46.330 
accept that you are giving power to the
planners

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:46.340
