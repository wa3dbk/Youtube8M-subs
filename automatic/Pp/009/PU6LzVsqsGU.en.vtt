 hello everyone my name is new in fil and 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.460
 welcome to a new video in this 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.709
 occasion will be the unpacking of lgl 5 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.990
 which is the average range that I chose has 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:15.049
 implemented in our country since 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.420
 a few months I hope that for the 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.160
 We wanted to do the channel 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.860
 unpacked let's see what it contains 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.870
 box 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.330
 as always at first sight shows us 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.920
 the device that this time is 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.590
 Very very big 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.760
 because it has a screen of 4 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.510
 inches with a resolution of 320 x 480 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.950
 let's set aside the device 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.950
 to see what it contains in the box 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.720
 we can find a 1500 battery 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.840
 thousand pesos that the truth is that we will 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.110
 get the day very well 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.809
 as always propaganda and documents of 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.730
 the company as well as the company that 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.730
 provides us with the telephone service 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.720
 a microusb cable to connect it to the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.920
 computers and also it serves us to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.030
 connect it to the charger and so be able to 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.030
 charge our device 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 and finally some helmets that are stereo 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.690
 of 3.5 are the standard has nothing 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690
 special 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.990
 let's focus on the device 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.570
 from the back we can see that 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.630
 It has a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.060
 with a flash in ld in this slot 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.090
 microsd we can find a card 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.730
 4 gigabytes already installed 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.480
 the card for 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.480
 the sim 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.610
 and on this side the speaker that is heard 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.920
 the truth is that this team has very 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.620
 good size 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.980
 and taking into account that it has 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.400
 android 4.0 the truth is that it is a 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.909
 good option to consider 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.909
 Y 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.250
 that we can find on the device 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.010
 a headset 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.860
 on this side three buttons that are going to 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.950
 to move the home of the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.870
 kickback and the menu 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.989

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.620
 the entry for the micro usb charger and 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.620
 the microphone 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.680
 on one side of the right side we are not going to 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.830
 find anything by the top the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.380
 turn off Botton 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.640

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.290
 minijack and on the left side the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.290
 more and less volume buttons 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.540
 and we will not find anything else in the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.540
 device 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.950

 4 gigabytes internal memory plus one 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.209
 sd card of 4 gigabytes and the 10 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.780
 pages says it has connectivity 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.850

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.500
