before<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> pebble<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.059> didn't<00:00:39.329> have

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
before the pebble we really didn't have

crowdfunding<00:00:44.129> concept<00:00:45.000> before<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.170> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
crowdfunding concept before then we

crowdfunding concept before then we
didn't<00:00:46.500> even<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.010> crowdfunding<00:00:47.340> was

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
didn't even know what crowdfunding was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.940 
didn't even know what crowdfunding was
and<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> wasn't<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> mainstream

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and it wasn't really in the mainstream

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
and it wasn't really in the mainstream
until<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> pebble<00:00:51.120> came<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
until the pebble came out and that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
until the pebble came out and that
really<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> Kickstarter<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
really was the Kickstarter for

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
really was the Kickstarter for
Kickstarter<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> since<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.489> been

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
Kickstarter and since then there's been

many crowdfunding websites that have

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
many crowdfunding websites that have
popped<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.059> capitalize<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> success

the<00:01:01.920> pebble<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> hit<00:01:02.850> smashing<00:01:03.570> their

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the pebble was a hit smashing their

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.250 
the pebble was a hit smashing their
original<00:01:04.409> goal<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:05.000> $100,000<00:01:06.000> by<00:01:06.600> getting<00:01:06.930> ten

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
original goal of $100,000 by getting ten
million<00:01:08.189> dollars<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.070> pebble<00:01:11.460> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
million dollars but now the pebble is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
million dollars but now the pebble is
facing<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.210> stiff<00:01:12.479> competition<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:13.500> some

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
facing some stiff competition from some

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.490 
facing some stiff competition from some
big<00:01:14.040> players<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.549> Android<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> Apple<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
big players like Android and Apple this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.670 
big players like Android and Apple this
is<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.860> first<00:01:17.189> experience<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> pebble

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
is my first experience with the pebble

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
is my first experience with the pebble
so<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> can't<00:01:20.159> compare<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> last<00:01:21.090> year's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
so I can't compare it to last year's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
so I can't compare it to last year's
version<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.500> review<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> be

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
version and this review is going to be

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
version and this review is going to be
solely<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.090> experiences<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
solely on my experiences with this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
solely on my experiences with this
year's<00:01:25.740> version<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:27.119> overly<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.630> love

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
year's version I'm not overly in love

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.990 
year's version I'm not overly in love
with<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> pebbles<00:01:28.470> look<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.700> honest

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
with the pebbles look I got to be honest

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
with the pebbles look I got to be honest
it<00:01:30.180> looks<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> children's<00:01:31.079> toy<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it looks like a children's toy so I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.940 
it looks like a children's toy so I
opted<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> toss<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> slick<00:01:33.509> rap<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
opted to toss on a slick rap on it as I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
opted to toss on a slick rap on it as I
mentioned<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:35.820> videos<00:01:36.210> carbon

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
mentioned a lot of other videos carbon

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
mentioned a lot of other videos carbon
fiber<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.560> looks<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.979> good<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.400> me<00:01:38.430> now

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
fiber just looks really good to me now

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
fiber just looks really good to me now
I'm<00:01:39.180> aware<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> steel<00:01:39.869> version<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'm aware that the steel version is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
I'm aware that the steel version is
coming<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.770> soon<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.970> version<00:01:42.270> right

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
coming out soon but this version right

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.660 
coming out soon but this version right
now<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.290> looks<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.040> children's<00:01:44.340> toy

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
now this looks like a children's toy

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210 
now this looks like a children's toy
pebble<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.689> uses<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.110> neural<00:01:46.409> band<00:01:46.680> size<00:01:46.920> at

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
pebble also uses a neural band size at

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
pebble also uses a neural band size at
22<00:01:47.729> millimeters<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> easily<00:01:48.930> replace

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
22 millimeters so you can easily replace

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
22 millimeters so you can easily replace
it<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> switch<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:51.060> or

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it out if you want to switch it up or

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
it out if you want to switch it up or
even<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:51.780> own<00:01:51.960> metal<00:01:52.290> band<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.829> default

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
even by your own metal band the default

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
even by your own metal band the default
band<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.670> made<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.119> silicon<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:55.380> nothing

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
band is made from silicon it's nothing

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
band is made from silicon it's nothing
exciting<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.670> gets<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> job<00:01:56.969> done<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
exciting but it gets the job done the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.859 
exciting but it gets the job done the
face<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> watch<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.130> very<00:01:59.610> bezel<00:02:00.570> heavy

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
face of the watch is very bezel heavy

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
face of the watch is very bezel heavy
and<00:02:01.259> comparing<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> something<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and comparing it to something like the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.760 
and comparing it to something like the
Moto<00:02:03.270> threes

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
Moto threes

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.359

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
60 there is a huge difference the pebble

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.389 
60 there is a huge difference the pebble
really<00:02:07.670> feels<00:02:07.939> like<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.239> hipster<00:02:08.629> toy<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.470> really

appear<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.599> real<00:02:23.989> watch<00:02:24.230> while<00:02:24.620> having

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
appear like a real watch while having

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.070 
appear like a real watch while having
smart<00:02:25.250> functions<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.209> pebble<00:02:26.540> supports

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
smart functions the pebble supports

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.979 
smart functions the pebble supports
water<00:02:27.349> resistance<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.250> also<00:02:28.430> seven<00:02:29.120> days<00:02:29.420> of

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
water resistance and also seven days of

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.259 
water resistance and also seven days of
battery<00:02:30.530> life<00:02:30.890> even<00:02:31.160> after<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.760> seven<00:02:32.120> days

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
battery life even after the seven days

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.960 
battery life even after the seven days
of<00:02:32.480> battery<00:02:32.720> life<00:02:33.049> my<00:02:33.349> pebble<00:02:33.620> still<00:02:34.459> was<00:02:34.670> just

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of battery life my pebble still was just

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.750 
of battery life my pebble still was just
displaying<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> time<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:37.160> couldn't<00:02:37.579> do

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
displaying the time and I couldn't do

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.309 
displaying the time and I couldn't do
anything<00:02:37.940> else<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.569> still<00:02:38.780> had<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.079> time

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
anything else but I still had the time

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.289 
anything else but I still had the time
on<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> watch<00:02:39.739> even<00:02:40.130> though<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.489> battery<00:02:40.819> was

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
on the watch even though the battery was

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.330 
on the watch even though the battery was
actually<00:02:41.690> dead<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.739> lasted<00:02:43.040> like<00:02:43.099> that

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
actually dead and it lasted like that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.670 
actually dead and it lasted like that
for<00:02:43.549> several<00:02:43.819> more<00:02:44.120> hours<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.750> that's<00:02:45.470> my

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
awesome battery life it makes me jealous

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.960 
awesome battery life it makes me jealous
when<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.810> go<00:02:50.989> back<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.319> my<00:02:51.349> moto<00:02:51.590> 360<00:02:51.970> knowing

when I go back to my moto 360 knowing

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
when I go back to my moto 360 knowing
that<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.569> charge<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.989> again<00:02:54.019> that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that I have to charge it again that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680 
that I have to charge it again that
night<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.400> speaking<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> charger<00:02:56.480> it

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
night now speaking of the charger it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.229 
night now speaking of the charger it
uses<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.349> weird<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:58.069> pin<00:02:58.340> connector<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
uses this weird to pin connector and

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.020 
uses this weird to pin connector and
it's<00:02:59.720> not<00:02:59.930> really<00:03:00.230> elegant<00:03:00.709> at<00:03:00.769> all<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.790> since

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
it's not really elegant at all but since

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.850 
it's not really elegant at all but since
the<00:03:02.180> battery<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.660> pebble<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.319> good<00:03:03.620> I

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
the battery and the pebble is so good I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.850 
the battery and the pebble is so good I
really<00:03:04.459> don't<00:03:04.760> mind<00:03:05.079> now<00:03:06.079> you<00:03:06.110> can<00:03:06.410> go<00:03:06.560> from

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
really don't mind now you can go from

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.879 
really don't mind now you can go from
dead<00:03:07.190> back<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> hundred<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.650> couple

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
dead back to a hundred in just a couple

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.460 
dead back to a hundred in just a couple
of<00:03:10.069> hours<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.329> really<00:03:11.720> give<00:03:11.870> pebble<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.260> pass

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
of hours so I really give pebble to pass

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.920 
of hours so I really give pebble to pass
on<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.829> one<00:03:13.069> also<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:14.060> achieve<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.690> great

does well against scuffs so far now I'm
done<00:03:26.870> with<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.139> aesthetics<00:03:27.650> let's<00:03:28.370> talk

done with the aesthetics let's talk
about<00:03:28.730> how<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.030> watch<00:03:29.329> actually<00:03:29.810> works<00:03:30.049> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
about how the watch actually works the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.680 
about how the watch actually works the
initial<00:03:31.040> setup<00:03:31.310> process<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.970> pretty<00:03:32.389> simple

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
initial setup process is pretty simple

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.930 
initial setup process is pretty simple
install<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> pebble<00:03:33.920> app<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.340> you're<00:03:34.790> pretty

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
install the pebble app and you're pretty

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.940

let<00:04:01.580> me<00:04:01.670> explain<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.330> sure<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.410> can

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
let me explain this to you sure you can

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.260 
let me explain this to you sure you can
still<00:04:03.650> access<00:04:03.890> notifications<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.060> if<00:04:05.150> you're

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
still access notifications and if you're

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.850 
still access notifications and if you're
on<00:04:05.390> Android<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:06.050> interact<00:04:06.230> with<00:04:06.530> them

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
on Android you can interact with them

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.160 
on Android you can interact with them
like<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.400> do<00:04:07.520> on<00:04:07.550> ware<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.050> is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
like you do on ware but this is

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.010 
like you do on ware but this is
application<00:04:09.890> driven<00:04:10.490> not<00:04:10.640> pebble<00:04:11.030> driven<00:04:11.360> so

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
application driven not pebble driven so

application driven not pebble driven so
in<00:04:12.110> hangouts<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.770> can<00:04:12.950> do<00:04:13.100> things<00:04:13.310> like<00:04:13.670> voice

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
in hangouts you can do things like voice

in<00:04:30.350> there<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.130> applications<00:04:31.730> stay<00:04:31.940> open<00:04:32.240> as

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
in there the applications stay open as

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.250 
in there the applications stay open as
long<00:04:32.390> as<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:32.840> want

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
enjoyable but at the same time it ties

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.790 
enjoyable but at the same time it ties
back<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.670> what<00:05:10.850> I<00:05:11.000> said<00:05:11.330> earlier<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:12.530> looks

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
back to what I said earlier it looks

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.310 
back to what I said earlier it looks
like<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.010> toy<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:14.120> animations<00:05:14.630> come<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.170> they

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
like a toy the animations come in they

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.890 
like a toy the animations come in they
look<00:05:15.560> nice<00:05:15.800> but<00:05:16.100> they<00:05:16.160> remind<00:05:16.610> me<00:05:16.730> of<00:05:16.900> Road

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
look nice but they remind me of Road

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.620 
look nice but they remind me of Road
Runner<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.290> the<00:05:18.500> coyote<00:05:19.130> just<00:05:19.430> spy<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:20.270> see

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
Runner and the coyote just spy you see

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.590 
Runner and the coyote just spy you see
like<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> dust<00:05:21.140> trail<00:05:21.440> going<00:05:21.680> behind<00:05:21.920> different

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
like a dust trail going behind different

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.640 
like a dust trail going behind different
applications<00:05:23.600> or<00:05:23.900> when<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.170> send<00:05:24.410> a<00:05:24.500> message

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
applications or when you send a message

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.150 
applications or when you send a message
it<00:05:25.460> just<00:05:25.760> sort<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.300> looks<00:05:26.540> like<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.750> toy<00:05:27.140> so<00:05:27.920> here

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
it just sort of looks like a toy so here

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.640 
it just sort of looks like a toy so here
are<00:05:28.220> my<00:05:28.280> final<00:05:28.670> takeaways<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.690> think<00:05:30.560> the

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
are my final takeaways I think the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.820 
are my final takeaways I think the
Pebble<00:05:31.040> watch<00:05:31.480> as<00:05:32.480> far<00:05:32.780> as<00:05:32.870> practicality<00:05:33.410> is

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
Pebble watch as far as practicality is

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.820 
Pebble watch as far as practicality is
top-notch<00:05:34.780> extreme<00:05:35.780> battery<00:05:36.110> life<00:05:36.290> water

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
top-notch extreme battery life water

resistance and eating display that you

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.870 
resistance and eating display that you

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
can see in all brightness situations

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.650 
can see in all brightness situations
that's<00:05:41.510> good<00:05:41.870> but<00:05:42.590> functionality<00:05:43.400> it's<00:05:44.390> not

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
that's good but functionality it's not

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.990 
that's good but functionality it's not
it<00:05:45.350> doesn't<00:05:45.410> integrate<00:05:45.890> into<00:05:46.220> Google<00:05:46.490> now<00:05:46.640> and

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
it doesn't integrate into Google now and

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.930 
it doesn't integrate into Google now and
with<00:05:47.330> Apple<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:48.140> does<00:05:48.200> less<00:05:48.890> than<00:05:49.370> Apple<00:05:49.730> watch

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
with Apple it does less than Apple watch

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.360 
with Apple it does less than Apple watch
there's<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.990> great<00:05:51.410> pebble<00:05:51.860> community<00:05:52.250> out

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
there's a great pebble community out

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.520 
there's a great pebble community out
there<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:52.850> I'm<00:05:52.940> not<00:05:53.240> denying<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.290> the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
there and I'm not denying that but the

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.400 
there and I'm not denying that but the
competition<00:05:55.220> right<00:05:55.490> now<00:05:55.520> is<00:05:56.000> way<00:05:56.540> too<00:05:56.600> stiff

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
competition right now is way too stiff

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.550 
competition right now is way too stiff
from<00:05:58.130> Google<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.610> Apple

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
so pebble you're one of the originators
