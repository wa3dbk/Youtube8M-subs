00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
design this one is called belly button

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.820 
design this one is called belly button
and<00:00:17.830> it's<00:00:18.130> really<00:00:18.820> as<00:00:19.060> funny<00:00:19.540> as<00:00:19.840> it<00:00:19.869> sounds<00:00:20.140> so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
and it's really as funny as it sounds so

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.650 
and it's really as funny as it sounds so
let's<00:00:21.040> get<00:00:21.279> on<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.640> machine<00:00:21.760> and<00:00:22.180> see<00:00:22.420> what<00:00:22.570> it

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
let's get on the machine and see what it

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.160 
let's get on the machine and see what it
looks<00:00:22.690> like<00:00:22.960> in<00:00:23.320> free<00:00:23.650> motion<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.720> we're<00:00:26.020> gonna

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
looks like in free motion so we're gonna

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.109 
looks like in free motion so we're gonna
get<00:00:26.440> started<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.010> work<00:00:27.250> working<00:00:27.610> on<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.789> four

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
get started and work working on a four

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.840 
get started and work working on a four
inch<00:00:28.330> square<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:29.410> I'm<00:00:29.590> just<00:00:29.770> gonna<00:00:29.920> start<00:00:30.310> by

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
inch square so I'm just gonna start by

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.570 
inch square so I'm just gonna start by
stitching<00:00:31.720> out<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.320> swing<00:00:32.830> you<00:00:33.040> around<00:00:33.070> with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
stitching out and swing you around with

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.630 
stitching out and swing you around with
a<00:00:33.610> nice<00:00:33.910> sized<00:00:34.270> circle<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:39.040> yep<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.520> a

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
a nice sized circle so yep it's a

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.030 
a nice sized circle so yep it's a
circular<00:00:39.940> design<00:00:40.360> because<00:00:41.260> that's<00:00:41.770> what<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
circular design because that's what a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.790 
circular design because that's what a
belly<00:00:42.250> button<00:00:42.520> is<00:00:42.880> now<00:00:43.750> we're<00:00:43.989> going<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.290> pivot

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
belly button is now we're going to pivot

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.540 
belly button is now we're going to pivot
back<00:00:45.399> and<00:00:46.270> forth<00:00:46.510> around<00:00:46.690> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.370 

we're<00:00:51.550> kind<00:00:51.820> of<00:00:51.880> doing<00:00:52.060> that<00:00:52.329> same<00:00:52.810> type<00:00:53.350> of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
we're kind of doing that same type of

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.160 
we're kind of doing that same type of
battling<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.340> we<00:00:54.520> did<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:56.260> lava<00:00:57.160> rocks

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
battling that we did with lava rocks

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190 
battling that we did with lava rocks
just<00:00:59.170> back<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.680> forth<00:01:00.600> once<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:01.780> as<00:01:01.930> big<00:01:02.140> as

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
just back and forth once it's as big as

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.380 
just back and forth once it's as big as
you<00:01:02.470> want<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.980> be<00:01:03.129> just<00:01:03.400> simply<00:01:03.910> travel

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
you want it to be just simply travel

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.290 
you want it to be just simply travel
stitch<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.710> swirl<00:01:06.430> around<00:01:06.640> with<00:01:07.150> your

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
stitch out and swirl around with your

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.230 
stitch out and swirl around with your
next<00:01:07.479> circle<00:01:09.509> pivot<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:12.040> around<00:01:12.400> as<00:01:12.850> many

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
next circle pivot go around as many

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.470 
next circle pivot go around as many
times<00:01:13.360> as<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.930> like

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.630 

this<00:01:21.780> design<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.620> great<00:01:23.250> for

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this design is going to be great for

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.290 
this design is going to be great for
learning<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.830> go<00:01:25.970> consistently<00:01:26.970> because

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
learning how to go consistently because

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.170 
learning how to go consistently because
you've<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.630> multiple<00:01:28.320> lines<00:01:28.980> of<00:01:29.340> echoing<00:01:29.790> as

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you've got multiple lines of echoing as

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
you've got multiple lines of echoing as
you<00:01:30.330> build<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.750> each<00:01:30.960> shape<00:01:31.290> you've<00:01:31.710> got

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you build up each shape you've got

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
you build up each shape you've got
travel<00:01:32.580> stitching<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.330> into<00:01:33.570> these<00:01:33.720> weird

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
travel stitching to get into these weird

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.070 
travel stitching to get into these weird
spaces<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:35.040> fill<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> really

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
spaces and fill them up it's a really

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.060 
spaces and fill them up it's a really
good<00:01:37.260> skill<00:01:37.710> builder<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:39.300> for<00:01:40.290> keeping<00:01:40.620> those

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
good skill builder as for keeping those

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.090 
good skill builder as for keeping those
at<00:01:41.310> those<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.820> consistent<00:01:42.810> distance<00:01:43.320> apart

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
at those a consistent distance apart

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
at those a consistent distance apart
really<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.000> comes<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.690> time<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.320> practice

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
really that comes with time and practice

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.740 
really that comes with time and practice
more<00:01:47.070> than<00:01:47.190> anything<00:01:47.400> else<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.630> going

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
more than anything else now you're going

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
more than anything else now you're going
to<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:48.930> weird<00:01:49.200> areas<00:01:49.620> like<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:49.980> triangular

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to get weird areas like this triangular

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
to get weird areas like this triangular
shape<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:51.120> here<00:01:51.420> I'm<00:01:51.660> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> fill<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
shape right here I'm going to fill that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.210 
shape right here I'm going to fill that
in<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.890> repeated<00:01:53.370> lines

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.510 

swinging<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.120> certainly<00:01:57.330> echoes<00:01:58.520> but

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
swinging out and certainly echoes but

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
swinging out and certainly echoes but
truly<00:01:59.850> practice<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> what's<00:02:01.050> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.410> help

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
truly practice is what's going to help

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.820 
truly practice is what's going to help
you<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> consistency<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:04.020> would

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
you get this consistency down I would

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.950 
you get this consistency down I would
say<00:02:05.010> take<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.310> design<00:02:05.550> like<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.180> our<00:02:06.510> back<00:02:06.720> out

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
say take a design like this our back out

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 
say take a design like this our back out
Shou<00:02:07.490> something<00:02:08.490> like<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.180> literally

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
Shou something like that and literally

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
Shou something like that and literally
stitch<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:10.950> entire<00:02:11.070> out<00:02:12.500> don't<00:02:13.500> try

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
stitch it over an entire out don't try

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
stitch it over an entire out don't try
and<00:02:13.950> change<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.700> designs<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.360> lot<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.870> pick

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and change up designs a lot just pick

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.250 
and change up designs a lot just pick
the<00:02:16.260> same<00:02:16.530> design<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.730> work<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.930> one

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the same design and work on that one

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.380 
the same design and work on that one
technique<00:02:19.830> now<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.460> going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.760> perfect

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
technique now is it going to be perfect

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.750 
technique now is it going to be perfect
no<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.800> going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> give<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> whole

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
no but it's going to give you a whole

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
no but it's going to give you a whole
lot<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.180> practice<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.080> lot<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.500> bang<00:02:25.620> for

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
with it so you can see you can continue

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.120 
with it so you can see you can continue
to<00:02:35.190> build<00:02:35.580> these<00:02:35.760> up<00:02:35.820> quite<00:02:36.690> big<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.620> take

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
to build these up quite big you can take

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.620 
to build these up quite big you can take
one<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.730> build<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.420> hall

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
one and just build it up to your hall

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.260 
one and just build it up to your hall
space<00:02:39.959> or<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.950> can<00:02:41.130> keep<00:02:41.310> them<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.580> lot<00:02:41.820> smaller

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
space or you can keep them a lot smaller

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.470 
space or you can keep them a lot smaller
let's<00:02:42.690> try<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.280> one<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.490> only<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.820> few<00:02:45.209> lines

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
let's try just one with only a few lines

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.619 
let's try just one with only a few lines
about

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:56.090 

so<00:02:49.629> here's<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.959> little<00:02:50.349> one<00:02:52.349> with<00:02:53.349> one<00:02:53.910> two

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
so here's a little one with one two

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.730 
so here's a little one with one two
three<00:02:56.670> lines<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.210> there<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.320> can<00:02:58.470> see

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
three lines in there and you can see

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.460 
three lines in there and you can see
what<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> difference<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.730> makes<00:03:00.470> those

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
what a difference that makes those

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.080 
what a difference that makes those
little<00:03:01.800> weird<00:03:02.100> areas<00:03:02.460> you're<00:03:02.700> gonna<00:03:02.880> deal

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
little weird areas you're gonna deal

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.910 
little weird areas you're gonna deal
with<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.630> keep<00:03:03.900> wiggling<00:03:04.200> my<00:03:04.530> way<00:03:04.710> into

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
with you see I keep wiggling my way into

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.330 
with you see I keep wiggling my way into
them<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.580> filling<00:03:06.510> them<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.290> think<00:03:08.190> that's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
them and filling them up I think that's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.130 
them and filling them up I think that's
really<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> best<00:03:08.850> thing<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.240> do<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:09.840> fill

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
really the best thing to do is just fill

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.880 
really the best thing to do is just fill
them<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.530> with<00:03:10.590> some<00:03:10.890> repeated<00:03:11.670> lines<00:03:12.890> just

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
them up with some repeated lines just

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.410 
them up with some repeated lines just
pick<00:03:14.130> one<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.610> designs<00:03:14.940> one<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
pick one of the designs one of the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.610 
pick one of the designs one of the
shapes<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:17.750> stitch<00:03:18.750> some<00:03:18.960> carillon<00:03:19.380> lines

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
shapes and stitch some carillon lines

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.840 
shapes and stitch some carillon lines
within<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.070> space<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.460> I<00:03:20.520> think<00:03:20.700> that's

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
within that space and I think that's

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.610 
within that space and I think that's
going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> work<00:03:21.210> out<00:03:21.390> just<00:03:21.720> fine

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.110 

so<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.860> see<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.280> difference<00:03:30.700> when<00:03:31.060> you

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
so you can see the difference when you

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.270 
so you can see the difference when you
have<00:03:31.420> one<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.780> only<00:03:31.930> has<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.200> few<00:03:32.530> echoes<00:03:32.980> it

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
have one that only has a few echoes it

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.670 
have one that only has a few echoes it
stays<00:03:33.520> a<00:03:33.550> lot<00:03:33.819> smaller<00:03:34.240> when<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.200> have<00:03:35.470> one

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
stays a lot smaller when you have one

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.400 
stays a lot smaller when you have one
with<00:03:35.890> bigger<00:03:36.160> echoes<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:37.780> know<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:37.959> gets<00:03:38.110> it

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
with bigger echoes you know it gets it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.100 
with bigger echoes you know it gets it
expands<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.640> takes<00:03:39.910> over<00:03:40.180> more<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
expands and it takes over more of the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.260 
expands and it takes over more of the
texture<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.770> really<00:03:42.459> kind<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.730> play<00:03:42.940> with<00:03:43.120> this

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
texture so really kind of play with this

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.729 
texture so really kind of play with this
this<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.569> gonna<00:03:43.900> have<00:03:44.140> kind<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.650> a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
this is gonna have kind of a

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.920 
this is gonna have kind of a
polka-dotted<00:03:45.310> effect<00:03:45.790> because<00:03:46.180> these<00:03:46.330> empty

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
polka-dotted effect because these empty

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.780 
polka-dotted effect because these empty
circles<00:03:47.380> are<00:03:47.500> always<00:03:47.860> going<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.310> stand<00:03:48.580> out

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
circles are always going to stand out

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.240 
circles are always going to stand out
quite<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> bit<00:03:50.050> on<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.560> surface<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:51.010> your<00:03:51.160> quilt
