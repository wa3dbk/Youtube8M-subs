right now we need it hill and this is
some<00:00:03.780> kickass<00:00:04.230> hill<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:05.160> we<00:00:05.220> had<00:00:05.460> lots<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.730> fun

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
some kickass hill now we had lots of fun

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.010 
some kickass hill now we had lots of fun
with<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.089> builders<00:00:06.450> but<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:06.779> really

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
with the builders but we're really

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.140 
with the builders but we're really
testing<00:00:07.410> these<00:00:07.649> pickups<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.250> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
testing these pickups now we're going to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.870 
testing these pickups now we're going to
tie<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.500> 300<00:00:10.500> kilogram<00:00:10.920> bail<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.519> back<00:00:11.700> of

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
tie a 300 kilogram bail to the back of

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.419 
tie a 300 kilogram bail to the back of
them<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> see<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:13.170> far<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.559> they<00:00:13.769> well<00:00:14.280> it's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
them and see how far up they well it's

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.980 
them and see how far up they well it's
run<00:00:14.639> into<00:00:14.969> hill<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.360> far<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.809> get<00:00:15.900> up

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
run into hill how far they can get up

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.660 
run into hill how far they can get up
this<00:00:16.109> really<00:00:16.500> steep<00:00:16.710> hill<00:00:16.770> two<00:00:17.490> wheel<00:00:17.640> drive

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
this really steep hill two wheel drive

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.950 
this really steep hill two wheel drive
to<00:00:17.940> start<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.660> they<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
to start with when they get to the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.760 
to start with when they get to the
bottom<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> hill<00:00:19.439> they're<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.710> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
bottom of the hill they're going to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.620 
bottom of the hill they're going to
engage<00:00:19.920> four<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.580> then<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:20.939> fingers

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
engage four and then it's just fingers

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.759 
engage four and then it's just fingers
across<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.140> far<00:00:22.380> then<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.680> up

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
across to see how far then get up

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.960 
across to see how far then get up
because<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.100> doubt<00:00:23.430> whether<00:00:23.609> actually

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
because I doubt whether actually

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.220 
because I doubt whether actually
anything<00:00:24.510> we're<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> make<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
anything we're going to make it to the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.189 
anything we're going to make it to the
top<00:00:25.439> okay<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.340> start<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.779> Toyota

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
top okay so we start with the the Toyota

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
top okay so we start with the the Toyota
Hilux<00:00:28.590> house<00:00:29.039> okay<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.490> gonna<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.820> well

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
Hilux house okay this was gonna do well

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.700 
Hilux house okay this was gonna do well
it's<00:00:32.180> it's<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.390> powerful<00:00:33.540> engine<00:00:33.870> got<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's it's a more powerful engine got a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.840 
it's it's a more powerful engine got a
very<00:00:34.890> sophisticated<00:00:35.100> four-wheel<00:00:35.640> drive

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
very sophisticated four-wheel drive

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
very sophisticated four-wheel drive
system<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.380> does<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> hesitate<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
system but he does have to hesitate to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
system but he does have to hesitate to
select<00:00:39.210> four-wheel<00:00:39.540> drive<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.620> that's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
select four-wheel drive and that's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
select four-wheel drive and that's
what's<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.640> happened<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.030> there

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
what's gonna be what happened just there

he just lost it on the other hesitation
lost<00:01:01.910> his<00:01:02.030> momentum<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:02.989> probably

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
lost his momentum and that probably

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:04.570 
lost his momentum and that probably
cheers<00:01:04.009> Carl

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580

so<00:01:05.540> how<00:01:05.780> do<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.900> reckon<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.110> Mitsuba<00:01:06.380> she's

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
so how do you reckon the Mitsuba she's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.200 
so how do you reckon the Mitsuba she's
gonna<00:01:06.680> do<00:01:06.860> them<00:01:07.040> well<00:01:07.700> it's<00:01:07.850> got<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:07.970> similar

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
gonna do them well it's got a similar

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.609 
gonna do them well it's got a similar
four-wheel<00:01:08.600> drive<00:01:08.810> system<00:01:09.170> into<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.380> fact

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
four-wheel drive system into the fact

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.930 
four-wheel drive system into the fact
that<00:01:09.710> he's<00:01:09.890> got<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.220> lose<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.550> bit<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.790> momentum

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
that he's got to lose a bit of momentum

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.880 
that he's got to lose a bit of momentum
to<00:01:11.360> select<00:01:11.659> his<00:01:11.780> four-wheel<00:01:12.110> drive<00:01:12.350> hi

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
to select his four-wheel drive hi

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.469 
to select his four-wheel drive hi
having<00:01:13.399> said<00:01:13.550> that<00:01:13.580> it's<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.909> least<00:01:14.060> powerful

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
having said that it's the least powerful

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.450 
having said that it's the least powerful
in<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> three<00:01:15.050> be<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.470> least<00:01:15.680> half<00:01:16.009> all<00:01:16.250> right

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
in the three be the least half all right

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.950 
in the three be the least half all right
it<00:01:16.729> could<00:01:16.909> be<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:17.060> problem<00:01:17.420> there<00:01:17.600> but<00:01:17.780> we'll

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
it could be a problem there but we'll

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.690 
it could be a problem there but we'll
just<00:01:18.140> have<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.470> wait<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.770> see<00:01:18.950> there<00:01:19.520> he<00:01:19.670> is

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
just have to wait and see there he is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.490 
just have to wait and see there he is
there's<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.240> hesitation<00:01:20.659> as<00:01:21.020> he<00:01:21.170> selects

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
there's the hesitation as he selects

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.830 
there's the hesitation as he selects
into<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.159> four-wheel<00:01:22.610> drive<00:01:22.640> system<00:01:22.909> and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
into the four-wheel drive system and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.749 
into the four-wheel drive system and
that<00:01:23.990> might<00:01:24.229> well<00:01:24.380> be<00:01:24.440> something<00:01:24.799> okay<00:01:25.550> here

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
that might well be something okay here

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.230 
that might well be something okay here
he<00:01:25.850> comes<00:01:26.060> here<00:01:26.300> he<00:01:26.330> comes<00:01:26.690> oh<00:01:27.190> look<00:01:28.250> oh<00:01:28.640> come

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.630 
on Carl come on oh that's it that's it
yeah<00:01:32.990> that's<00:01:33.410> as<00:01:33.560> far<00:01:33.710> as<00:01:33.830> he's<00:01:33.979> gonna<00:01:34.130> go<00:01:34.369> it's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
yeah that's as far as he's gonna go it's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.400 
yeah that's as far as he's gonna go it's
just<00:01:34.820> slightly<00:01:35.420> less<00:01:35.780> than<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.050> highlights

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
just slightly less than the highlights

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.779 
just slightly less than the highlights
today<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.860> again<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.130> think<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.460> just<00:01:37.490> down

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
today and again I think it's just down

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.370 
today and again I think it's just down
to<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.060> momentum<00:01:38.300> of<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.659> vehicle<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.200> see

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
to the momentum of the vehicle can see

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.630 
to the momentum of the vehicle can see
can<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:39.800> see<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.070> can<00:01:40.190> see<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.520> gear

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
can you can see you can see the gear

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.160 
can you can see you can see the gear
change<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.330> that's<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.659> that's<00:01:41.869> right<00:01:42.050> it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
change and that's it that's right it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.389 
change and that's it that's right it
makes<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.530> little<00:01:42.800> bit<00:01:42.860> awkward<00:01:43.009> in<00:01:43.280> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
makes it that little bit awkward in a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.700 
makes it that little bit awkward in a
difficult<00:01:43.789> situation<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.869> how<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.380> Navara

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
difficult situation so how is the Navara

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.620 
difficult situation so how is the Navara
different<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:46.880> vehicle<00:01:47.390> has

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
different then this vehicle has

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.029 
different then this vehicle has
four-wheel<00:01:48.229> drive<00:01:48.560> system<00:01:48.950> this

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
four-wheel drive system this

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.889 
four-wheel drive system this
electronically<00:01:49.640> switchable<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.539> I'll<00:01:50.659> do<00:01:50.840> it

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
electronically switchable and I'll do it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.090 
electronically switchable and I'll do it
from<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> dashboard<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.710> means<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:51.979> won't

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
from the dashboard it means you won't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
from the dashboard it means you won't
lose<00:01:52.369> any<00:01:52.550> momentum<00:01:52.700> that's<00:01:53.240> just<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.450> flick<00:01:53.720> of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
lose any momentum that's just a flick of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.930 
lose any momentum that's just a flick of
a<00:01:53.899> switch<00:01:53.929> that<00:01:54.380> makes<00:01:55.130> all<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.340> difference

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
a switch that makes all the difference

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.550 
a switch that makes all the difference
okay<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.330> it's<00:01:56.509> moving<00:01:56.840> around<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.170> corner

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
okay so it's moving around the corner

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.830 
okay so it's moving around the corner
smoothly<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.729> base<00:01:58.940> -<00:01:59.149> hell<00:01:59.360> yeah<00:01:59.720> he

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
smoothly to the base - hell yeah he

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.419 
smoothly to the base - hell yeah he
knows<00:01:59.959> just<00:02:00.140> no<00:02:00.259> hesitation<00:02:00.830> now<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.099> already

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
knows just no hesitation now is already

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.400 
knows just no hesitation now is already
selected<00:02:01.610> four-wheel<00:02:02.179> drive<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.780> here<00:02:03.289> he

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
selected four-wheel drive and here he

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.850 
selected four-wheel drive and here he
comes

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
comes

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.219 
comes
always<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.369> wet<00:02:04.520> muddy<00:02:04.729> bit<00:02:04.970> Oh

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.510 

and<00:02:09.229> he's<00:02:09.320> done<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.530> didn't<00:02:09.950> quite<00:02:10.040> easily

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
and he's done it didn't quite easily

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.850 
and he's done it didn't quite easily
didn't<00:02:10.790> stand<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.090> chance<00:02:11.120> at<00:02:11.630> hay<00:02:11.810> bale<00:02:12.050> and

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
didn't stand a chance at hay bale and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.260 
didn't stand a chance at hay bale and
equally<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.250> could<00:02:13.400> see<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.820> just<00:02:13.850> continue

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
equally you could see you just continue

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.420 
equally you could see you just continue
the<00:02:14.510> momentum<00:02:14.600> up<00:02:14.990> absolutely<00:02:15.500> nothing<00:02:16.160> to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
the momentum up absolutely nothing to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.730 
the momentum up absolutely nothing to
really<00:02:17.180> was<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> pre<00:02:17.900> convincing<00:02:18.410> wasn't<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
really was a pre convincing wasn't it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.070 
really was a pre convincing wasn't it
very<00:02:18.980> good<00:02:19.340> sandy<00:02:20.150> after<00:02:20.270> all<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> fun<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
very good sandy after all the fun and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.540 
very good sandy after all the fun and
games<00:02:21.110> today<00:02:21.590> what<00:02:21.830> what<00:02:22.130> we<00:02:22.280> learned<00:02:22.460> about

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
games today what what we learned about

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.790 
games today what what we learned about
the<00:02:22.730> benefits<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> Navara<00:02:23.840> well<00:02:24.320> because

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the benefits of the Navara well because

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.960 
the benefits of the Navara well because
we've<00:02:24.920> got<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.130> switchable<00:02:25.610> four-wheel

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
we've got this switchable four-wheel

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.790 
we've got this switchable four-wheel
drive<00:02:26.210> system<00:02:26.660> which<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.960> electronic<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
drive system which is electronic it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.530 
drive system which is electronic it
means<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.220> don't<00:02:28.340> lose<00:02:28.580> any<00:02:28.880> momentum<00:02:29.060> in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
means we don't lose any momentum in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.690 
means we don't lose any momentum in
really<00:02:30.050> critical<00:02:30.530> situations<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.490> it's<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
really critical situations and it's the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.550 
really critical situations and it's the
most<00:02:31.850> powerful<00:02:32.150> engineering<00:02:32.720> events<00:02:33.080> with

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
most powerful engineering events with

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.420 
most powerful engineering events with
the<00:02:33.680> most<00:02:33.860> torque

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the most torque

absolutely<00:02:37.270> right<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.540> take<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
absolutely right you can take the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.170 
absolutely right you can take the
hay-bale<00:02:38.870> back
