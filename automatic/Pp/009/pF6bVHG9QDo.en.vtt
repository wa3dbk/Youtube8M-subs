strategy<00:00:06.540> or<00:00:06.690> move<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> quick<00:00:07.589> win<00:00:07.859> and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
strategy or move for a quick win and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.910 
strategy or move for a quick win and
often<00:00:09.120> times<00:00:09.300> when<00:00:09.480> I'm<00:00:09.570> opening<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> game

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
often times when I'm opening on a game

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.620 
often times when I'm opening on a game
this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.280> what<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> go<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.179> initial

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
this is what I go for this is my initial

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.419 
this is what I go for this is my initial
strategy<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.230> if<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.410> blocked<00:00:13.679> or

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
strategy and if it's blocked or

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.820 
strategy and if it's blocked or
compromised<00:00:14.969> somehow<00:00:15.269> then<00:00:15.599> I'll<00:00:15.870> go<00:00:16.529> into

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
compromised somehow then I'll go into

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.290 
compromised somehow then I'll go into
backup<00:00:17.250> plans<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.940> basically<00:00:18.180> how

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
backup plans but this is basically how

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.019 
backup plans but this is basically how
I'll<00:00:18.570> start<00:00:18.840> most<00:00:19.170> games<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> change

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
I'll start most games I like to change

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.310 
I'll start most games I like to change
up<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.270> bit<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.720> especially<00:00:22.050> if<00:00:22.230> I'm

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
up a little bit so especially if I'm

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.480 
up a little bit so especially if I'm
playing<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> same<00:00:22.740> person<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> time

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
playing the same person all the time

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
playing the same person all the time
they<00:00:24.240> kind<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.600> used<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
they kind of get used to what you do and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.769 
they kind of get used to what you do and
it's<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.029> switching<00:00:27.330> around<00:00:27.510> so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it's good to what to switching around so

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.570 
it's good to what to switching around so
they're<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.560> prepared<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.490> know

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
they're not you know prepared you know

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.919 
they're not you know prepared you know
for<00:00:29.760> your<00:00:29.880> specific<00:00:30.359> attack<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.810> your

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
for your specific attack or your

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.979 
for your specific attack or your
strategy<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:32.309> basically<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
strategy but basically this is one of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
strategy but basically this is one of
the<00:00:34.170> quickest<00:00:34.800> ways<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.340> win<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> game<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> chess

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the quickest ways to win a game of chess

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.180 
the quickest ways to win a game of chess
all<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> traditional

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
all right this is not a traditional

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.610 
all right this is not a traditional
chess<00:00:38.610> board<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.809> you're<00:00:39.930> new<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> chess<00:00:40.410> or

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
chess board so if you're new to chess or

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
chess board so if you're new to chess or
don't<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> great<00:00:41.640> understanding<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
don't have a great understanding the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.760 
don't have a great understanding the
pieces<00:00:42.780> may<00:00:42.930> seem<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.290> odd

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pieces may seem a little odd

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.930 
pieces may seem a little odd
you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> bishops<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:44.850> bit

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you know the bishops a little bit

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
you know the bishops a little bit
different<00:00:45.270> all<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> other<00:00:46.140> pieces<00:00:46.260> are

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
different all the other pieces are

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.779 
different all the other pieces are
pretty<00:00:46.890> close<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.640> look<00:00:47.730> like

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
pretty close to what it would look like

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.760 
pretty close to what it would look like
you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> rooks<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.500> course

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you know like the rooks and of course

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
you know like the rooks and of course
the<00:00:49.890> Knights<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.280> always<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> horse<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.000> some

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the Knights are always a horse of some

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
the Knights are always a horse of some
kind<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.079> king<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.289> queen<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.469> pretty

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
kind on the king and queen are pretty

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.119 
kind on the king and queen are pretty
obvious<00:00:52.969> but<00:00:53.969> anyway<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:55.440> playing<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> red

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
obvious but anyway I'm playing the red

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
obvious but anyway I'm playing the red
side<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.120> white<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
side here which would be white and the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
side here which would be white and the
Queen<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.260> her<00:00:58.469> her<00:00:58.800> color<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Queen has her her color so this is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
Queen has her her color so this is
considered<00:00:59.940> white<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.629> considered

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
considered white and that is considered

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.889 
considered white and that is considered
black<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> purposes<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
black you know for the purposes of the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.640 
black you know for the purposes of the
game<00:01:04.129> now<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.330> usually<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
game now what I will usually do for a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.820 
game now what I will usually do for a
quick<00:01:08.010> win<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> most

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
quick win is I want to go to the most

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
quick win is I want to go to the most
vulnerable<00:01:11.040> spot<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> beginning<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> game

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
vulnerable spot and beginning the game

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
vulnerable spot and beginning the game
which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.260> here

which is right here

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.760 
which is right here
it's<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.119> diagonal<00:01:15.119> spot<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> King<00:01:16.590> on

the opposite side my weak point is right

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.570 
the opposite side my weak point is right
here<00:01:19.590> okay

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
here okay

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810 
here okay
in<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:21.180> case<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.080> f2<00:01:22.920> that's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
in my case it's going to be f2 that's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.200 
in my case it's going to be f2 that's
the<00:01:24.000> position<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:25.229> weak<00:01:25.619> spot<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> on

the position that my weak spot is and on

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.140 
the position that my weak spot is and on
the<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.540> side<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> green<00:01:28.650> side

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.390 
their position is going to be f7 okay
right<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
right here so what I want to do is I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.210 
right here so what I want to do is I
want<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.939> bring<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:36.630> Queen<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.560> f7<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
want to bring in my Queen to f7 but I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
want to bring in my Queen to f7 but I
have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> use<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> piece<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.900> block<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.320> all

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
have to use a piece to block it all

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
have to use a piece to block it all
right<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.640> opening<00:01:42.060> move<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> usually<00:01:42.810> my

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
right so my opening move is usually my

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.499 
right so my opening move is usually my
King's<00:01:43.259> pawn<00:01:43.560> okay<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.090> case<00:01:45.149> it's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
King's pawn okay so in this case it's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.440 
King's pawn okay so in this case it's
going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.810> e<00:01:46.020> 2<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:47.399> e4<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> very

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
going to be e 2 to e4 this is a very

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
going to be e 2 to e4 this is a very
common<00:01:48.810> opening<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.350> study<00:01:49.649> chess<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
common opening if you study chess and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.859 
common opening if you study chess and
some<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> big<00:01:50.579> matches<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
some of the big matches this is

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
some of the big matches this is
something<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.409> often<00:01:52.649> seen<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
something that's often seen a lot of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.780 
something that's often seen a lot of
times<00:01:53.670> would<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> King's<00:01:54.240> pawn<00:01:54.509> e<00:01:54.799> 2<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> 4

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
times would be the King's pawn e 2 to 4

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
times would be the King's pawn e 2 to 4
or<00:01:57.030> d2<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.049> d4<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.680> would<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:58.950> Queens

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
or d2 to d4 which would be your Queens

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.249 
or d2 to d4 which would be your Queens
pawn<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.450> what<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.659> does<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
pawn out but what this does is this

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
pawn out but what this does is this
gives<00:02:01.469> me<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> crisscross<00:02:02.070> opening<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> can

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
gives me a crisscross opening so I can

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.300 
gives me a crisscross opening so I can
now<00:02:03.270> move<00:02:03.450> my<00:02:03.689> bishop<00:02:03.899> freely<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.979> bring<00:02:05.189> out

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
now move my bishop freely to bring out

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.039 
now move my bishop freely to bring out
into<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> game<00:02:05.820> play<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.840> bring<00:02:06.899> my

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
into the game play or I could bring my

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
into the game play or I could bring my
Queen<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.469> now

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
Queen out now

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.339 
Queen out now
again<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.149> goal<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.720> my<00:02:09.869> Queen<00:02:10.110> right

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
again my goal is to get my Queen right

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.530 
again my goal is to get my Queen right
here<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.890> also<00:02:11.370> block<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.270> there's<00:02:12.420> two

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
here and also block it so there's two

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.680 
here and also block it so there's two
ways<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
ways I can do this the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.040 
ways I can do this the
this<00:02:13.780> way<00:02:13.960> okay<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.010> bring<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.520> here<00:02:16.050> but

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
this way okay is to bring it to here but

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.780 
this way okay is to bring it to here but
when<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.770> sometimes<00:02:18.100> people<00:02:18.340> panic

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
when you do that sometimes people panic

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.400 
when you do that sometimes people panic
they'll<00:02:19.090> bring<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.300> pawn<00:02:19.540> up<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.170> know<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
they'll bring a pawn up you know and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.690 
they'll bring a pawn up you know and
freaks<00:02:20.680> everyone<00:02:21.040> else<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.430> I'll<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.670> is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
freaks everyone else so what I'll do is

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.000 
freaks everyone else so what I'll do is
a<00:02:21.970> little<00:02:22.150> bit<00:02:22.270> not<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.320> obvious<00:02:23.740> as<00:02:23.860> I'll

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
a little bit not so obvious as I'll

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.250 
a little bit not so obvious as I'll
bring<00:02:24.130> my<00:02:24.310> queen<00:02:24.930> right<00:02:25.930> here<00:02:26.230> okay<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
next thing so let's pretend we're play

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.970 
next thing so let's pretend we're play
the<00:02:31.840> game<00:02:32.050> right

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the game right

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.250 
the game right

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
since I'm white here I go first boom

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.050 
since I'm white here I go first boom
okay<00:02:35.710> they<00:02:35.950> go<00:02:36.070> first<00:02:36.280> maybe<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.580> counter<00:02:37.000> it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
okay they go first maybe the counter it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.370 
okay they go first maybe the counter it
doesn't<00:02:37.480> really<00:02:37.600> make<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> difference

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
doesn't really make a difference

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.440 
doesn't really make a difference
bring<00:02:38.980> my<00:02:39.100> queen<00:02:39.340> out<00:02:39.520> maybe<00:02:40.090> they<00:02:40.240> bring

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it's going to be two moves in order to

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.960 
it's going to be two moves in order to
get<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.470> same<00:03:02.830> position<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.550> block<00:03:03.670> it

get to that same position to block it
it's<00:03:04.420> not<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:04.780> obvious<00:03:05.140> okay<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.430> fastest<00:03:06.880> way

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it's not as obvious okay the fastest way

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's not as obvious okay the fastest way
to<00:03:07.060> really<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:08.020> with<00:03:08.530> your<00:03:08.770> your

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.540 
overlooked even by some professionals or
najin<00:03:56.560> say<00:03:56.680> professionals<00:03:57.160> but<00:03:57.250> people<00:03:57.430> who

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
najin say professionals but people who

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.880 
najin say professionals but people who
play<00:03:57.700> chess<00:03:57.940> often<00:03:58.420> they<00:03:59.080> have<00:03:59.200> such<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.440> deep

play chess often they have such a deep
strategy<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.610> mind<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:01.420> sometimes

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
strategy in mind that sometimes

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.630

something<00:04:02.050> as<00:04:02.230> simple<00:04:02.380> this<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.800> overlooked

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
something as simple this is overlooked

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.050 
something as simple this is overlooked
so<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.680> said<00:04:05.739> find<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.340> weak<00:04:06.519> spot<00:04:06.700> on

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
so like I said find that weak spot on

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.229 
so like I said find that weak spot on
the<00:04:07.150> other<00:04:07.269> other<00:04:08.019> side<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.530> board<00:04:08.739> and

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the other other side of the board and

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.759 
the other other side of the board and
get<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.269> piece<00:04:10.480> in<00:04:10.630> position<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.140> block<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.560> and

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
get a piece in position to block it and

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.259 
get a piece in position to block it and
bring<00:04:12.310> your<00:04:12.400> queen<00:04:12.640> in<00:04:12.760> for<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.940> kill

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
and that's checkmate some things that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.229 
and that's checkmate some things that
will<00:04:17.080> foil<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.620> plan<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.130> your<00:04:18.850> opponent

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
will foil this plan and your opponent

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.300 
will foil this plan and your opponent
may<00:04:19.359> may<00:04:20.080> screw<00:04:20.380> this<00:04:20.500> up<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.859> not<00:04:20.950> even<00:04:21.190> know

lot of people don't play because I think

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.879 
lot of people don't play because I think
it's<00:06:11.050> intimidating<00:06:11.260> or<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:11.770> too

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
it's intimidating or it's too

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.950 
it's intimidating or it's too
complicated<00:06:12.190> and<00:06:12.639> once<00:06:13.360> you<00:06:13.449> get<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.630> basics

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
complicated and once you get the basics

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.360 
complicated and once you get the basics
down<00:06:13.990> it<00:06:14.289> really<00:06:14.530> isn't<00:06:14.650> complicated<00:06:14.979> and

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
down it really isn't complicated and

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.760 
down it really isn't complicated and
some<00:06:15.729> of<00:06:15.820> the<00:06:15.880> hardest<00:06:16.240> people<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.599> the<00:06:17.590> play

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
some of the hardest people to the play

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.320 
some of the hardest people to the play
against<00:06:18.159> are<00:06:18.280> people<00:06:18.580> who<00:06:18.699> who<00:06:19.030> are<00:06:19.060> new

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
against are people who who are new

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.700 
against are people who who are new
because<00:06:19.990> they<00:06:20.080> don't<00:06:20.229> have<00:06:20.380> a<00:06:20.409> strategy

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
because they don't have a strategy

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.560 
because they don't have a strategy
because<00:06:21.610> they're<00:06:21.789> kind<00:06:21.940> of<00:06:22.000> randomly<00:06:22.300> moving

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
because they're kind of randomly moving

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.939 
because they're kind of randomly moving
pieces<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:22.960> screwing<00:06:23.530> you<00:06:23.620> up<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:23.889> they

don't even know it those are some of the
