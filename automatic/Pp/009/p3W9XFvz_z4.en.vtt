00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
from some of the gate areas that I've

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.810 
from some of the gate areas that I've
got<00:00:55.739> gaps<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:56.699> they'd

out<00:01:02.460> very<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.850> slowly<00:01:03.059> although<00:01:03.390> will

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
out very very slowly although will

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
out very very slowly although will
suddenly<00:01:03.719> dart<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.769> suddenly<00:01:04.979> run

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
suddenly dart out if they suddenly run
out<00:01:05.309> quite<00:01:05.640> fast<00:01:06.000> where<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> gaps<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.810> they

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
out quite fast where the gaps are they

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.390 
out quite fast where the gaps are they
will<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.260> head<00:01:07.380> straight<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.979> they

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
other parts of the gates there so it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.460

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.800 
starters and all the other females in
the<00:01:45.380> herd<00:01:46.150> but<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.180> think<00:01:47.390> they<00:01:47.450> will<00:01:47.570> settle

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the herd but I think they will settle

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.940 
the herd but I think they will settle
down<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.230> they've<00:01:48.320> got<00:01:48.500> each<00:01:48.620> other

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
down and they've got each other

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.110 
down and they've got each other
so<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.460> think<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:49.730> think<00:01:49.910> they'll<00:01:50.000> be<00:01:50.090> fine

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120
