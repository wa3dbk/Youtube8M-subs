00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.400
 hi everyone has happened these 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.410
 today's people I will make you 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.600
 listen to the radio messages that we 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.450
 can listen so on reese disease 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.770
 that's thanks to the intermediary of 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.270
 these little TVs that you are very 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.380
 certainly could have noticed that they are a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.170
 little in the whole map 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.870
 we have four or five I believe 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 personally I knew how to reactivate 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.079
 than the TV that is next to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 electricity and above the waist 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 Kraft crafting and here we go again 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.269
 so that the same TV obviously then 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.530
 to listen to the fun radio message the 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.809
 radio messages because there are still 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 three or four minutes of messages with 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.290
 different characters it takes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 turn on the electricity remained at 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.979
 repeat 15 plants in front of the small TV 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.019
 by pressing x as a guignol lo 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.540
 and after a while you should 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.729
 hear the characters speak and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.629
 this is simply 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.769
 I also want to apologize because 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.000
 you certainly hear a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.950
 zombie because you can not 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.270
 disable the path of ambition if we 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.440
 disables the channels between then the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.330
 radio messages so it's a bit of a 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.220
 shit you really sorry so open 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:14.700
 surviving topics and paranoia we 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.700
 but this remains to be confirmed 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.090

 we operate our own base of operation 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.380
 Well these data appear to have been 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.360
 destroyed in a fire just before 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.289

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.349
