00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
but you can see it's a different design

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.130 
but you can see it's a different design
in<00:00:49.350> terms<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> decals<00:00:50.660> no<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.870> a

very<00:01:00.870> subtle<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.440> cool<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.840> in

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
very subtle and cool I like that and in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
very subtle and cool I like that and in
terms<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> shape<00:01:04.909> it's<00:01:05.909> fairly<00:01:06.180> standard

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
terms of the shape it's fairly standard

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.960 
terms of the shape it's fairly standard
I'll<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.990> honest<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> slight<00:01:08.400> issue<00:01:08.700> I've

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
I'll be honest this is slight issue I've

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
I'll be honest this is slight issue I've
got<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.360> surfaced<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> bit<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.350> CAA

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
got that surfaced on for a bit like CAA

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.590 
got that surfaced on for a bit like CAA
they<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.640> reproducing<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> same

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
they just it's reproducing the same

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
they just it's reproducing the same
shape<00:01:13.200> over<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:13.950> again<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.490> there's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
shape over and over again really there's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.990 
shape over and over again really there's
not<00:01:14.820> much<00:01:14.939> variety<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.750> imagination<00:01:16.259> there

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
not much variety or imagination there

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
not much variety or imagination there
which<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> little<00:01:18.299> bit<00:01:18.630> frustrating<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.380> at

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
which is a little bit frustrating but at

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870 
which is a little bit frustrating but at
least<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.799> particular<00:01:19.979> piece<00:01:20.640> it's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
least in this particular piece it's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.310 
least in this particular piece it's
slightly<00:01:21.210> different<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> look

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
slightly different because if you look

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
slightly different because if you look
at<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:23.610> how<00:01:23.640> there's<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.689> really

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
at that look how there's just not really

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
at that look how there's just not really
any<00:01:25.080> concave<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> tiniest

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
any concave in there just the tiniest

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.960 
any concave in there just the tiniest
bit<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:28.320> less<00:01:28.500> concave<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.460> back<00:01:29.729> then

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
bit a lot less concave on this back then

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
bit a lot less concave on this back then
on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> rest<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> earth<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.930> Sanford

range<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:32.790> fact<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> bat<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:33.659> actually

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
range in fact this bat was actually

range in fact this bat was actually
hand-picked<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.430> SF<00:01:35.909> Stanford

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
hand-picked from our SF Stanford

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960 
hand-picked from our SF Stanford
distributor<00:01:37.020> recently<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.520> last<00:01:38.670> week

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
distributor recently just last week

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.640 
distributor recently just last week
actually<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> few<00:01:40.229> available

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
actually and there are a few available

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
actually and there are a few available
we<00:01:41.250> picked<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.700> one

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
we picked this one

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
we picked this one
one<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> reasons<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.350> picked<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.770> was

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
one the reasons we picked it was

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.990 
one the reasons we picked it was
certainly<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> full

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
certainly because it had more of a full

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.999 
certainly because it had more of a full
profile<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> wider<00:01:46.320> sweet<00:01:46.710> spot

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
profile so it had a wider sweet spot

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.550 
profile so it had a wider sweet spot
less<00:01:47.520> concaving<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.689> therefore<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.439> you're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
less concaving and therefore if you're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
less concaving and therefore if you're
hitting<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> ball<00:01:50.100> off-center<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.030> know

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
hitting the ball off-center you know

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.160 
hitting the ball off-center you know
you're<00:01:51.390> getting<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.720> bit<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.020> wood

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you're getting a little bit more wood

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.649 
you're getting a little bit more wood
behind<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.890> another<00:01:53.790> reason<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.180> picked<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
behind it another reason we picked it

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
behind it another reason we picked it
was<00:01:55.290> looks<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.369> performance<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.030> just

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
was looks and performance we just

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
was looks and performance we just
thought<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.540> superior<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> other<00:01:58.409> ones

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
thought was superior to the other ones

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
thought was superior to the other ones
that<00:01:58.890> were<00:01:59.009> available<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.329> at

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that were available and if you look at

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030 
that were available and if you look at
the<00:02:00.509> looks<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.560> sentence<00:02:01.890> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the looks you know you can sentence you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.450 
the looks you know you can sentence you
are<00:02:02.159> 11<00:02:02.579> grains<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.320> no<00:02:04.320> heart<00:02:04.619> would<00:02:04.860> only

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
are 11 grains there no heart would only

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
are 11 grains there no heart would only
really<00:02:05.700> one<00:02:05.969> blemish<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.290> there

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
really one blemish that little one there

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
really one blemish that little one there
which<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> way<00:02:08.220> from<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> main<00:02:08.700> playing<00:02:09.030> area

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
which is way from the main playing area

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.830 
which is way from the main playing area
anyway

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
anyway

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
anyway
and<00:02:09.989> won't<00:02:10.530> affect<00:02:10.830> performance<00:02:10.950> at<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and won't affect performance at all so

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330 
and won't affect performance at all so
very<00:02:12.420> good<00:02:12.690> looking<00:02:12.989> back<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.440> incident<00:02:13.920> great

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.710 
mallet and the board like normal just
worked<00:02:25.950> my<00:02:26.099> way<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.280> from<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.700> toe<00:02:26.970> right<00:02:27.540> up

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
worked my way up from the toe right up

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
worked my way up from the toe right up
to<00:02:27.930> brains<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> signature<00:02:29.010> there<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
sticker I'll be honest and say it's a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.840 
sticker I'll be honest and say it's a
little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:40.739> harder<00:02:41.220> than<00:02:41.340> some<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> other

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
little bit harder than some of the other

little bit harder than some of the other
SS<00:02:42.209> sound<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.690> bats<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:44.430> not

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
SS sound for bats that we have it's not

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.750 
SS sound for bats that we have it's not
a<00:02:44.670> softer<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.830> probably<00:02:47.370> might<00:02:47.549> take

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
a softer some so it probably might take

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.789 
a softer some so it probably might take
a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:48.180> bit<00:02:48.330> more<00:02:48.390> playing<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.200> before<00:02:49.739> it

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
a little bit more playing in before it

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.490 
a little bit more playing in before it
reaches<00:02:50.100> its<00:02:50.250> peak<00:02:50.459> maybe<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.819> few<00:02:51.060> games<00:02:51.500> but

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
reaches its peak maybe a few games but

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.960 
reaches its peak maybe a few games but
it's<00:02:52.680> having<00:02:53.160> knocked<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.549> few<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.910> these

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
it's having knocked in a few of these

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
it's having knocked in a few of these
bucks<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.019> do<00:02:55.440> soften

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
bucks I know that they really do soften

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
bucks I know that they really do soften
up<00:02:56.040> after<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.489> knocking<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.540> they're<00:02:57.690> only

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
up after the knocking in so they're only

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
up after the knocking in so they're only
gonna<00:02:58.110> improve<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.739> improve<00:02:58.830> pretty<00:02:59.489> quickly

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
gonna improve and improve pretty quickly

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.180 
gonna improve and improve pretty quickly
as<00:03:00.060> well<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.140> bear<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.530> mind<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:02.069> only

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
as well so bear that in mind it's only

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:16.360 
as well so bear that in mind it's only
gonna<00:03:02.400> get<00:03:02.519> better

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.009 

yeah<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.640> need<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> get<00:03:18.060> better<00:03:18.239> that's<00:03:18.570> not<00:03:18.900> an

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
yeah I need to get better that's not an

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.680 
yeah I need to get better that's not an
improvement<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.680> these<00:03:19.890> videos<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.640> if<00:03:21.600> you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
improvement for these videos and if you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.220 
improvement for these videos and if you
see<00:03:22.019> marks<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:23.359> never<00:03:24.359> surprise<00:03:24.810> obviously

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
see marks of never surprise obviously

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.750 
see marks of never surprise obviously
they<00:03:25.380> won't<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.769> present<00:03:26.190> once<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.549> fully

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
they won't be present once it's fully

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.780 
they won't be present once it's fully
knocked<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.319> but<00:03:28.319> yeah<00:03:28.500> really<00:03:29.040> good<00:03:29.280> response

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
knocked in but yeah really good response

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.550 
knocked in but yeah really good response
I<00:03:30.030> think<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:30.900> these<00:03:31.200> are<00:03:31.380> such

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
I think it's you know these are such

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.349 
I think it's you know these are such
time<00:03:31.769> for<00:03:31.950> bats<00:03:32.100> are<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.400> consistently<00:03:33.150> good

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
time for bats are so consistently good

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.920 
time for bats are so consistently good
in<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.260> regard<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.859> really<00:03:35.130> do<00:03:35.310> rate<00:03:35.579> me<00:03:35.930> pick

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
in that regard I really do rate me pick

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.830 
in that regard I really do rate me pick
up<00:03:37.079> on<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.799> also<00:03:38.000> very<00:03:39.000> good<00:03:39.359> but<00:03:39.600> I

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
up on this one it's also very good but I

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.090 
up on this one it's also very good but I
just<00:03:40.319> think<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.530> pick<00:03:40.709> up<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.040> is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
just think they pick up and this is

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.500 
just think they pick up and this is
slightly<00:03:41.430> lighter<00:03:41.639> than<00:03:42.000> some<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.389> other

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
slightly lighter than some of the other

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.830 
slightly lighter than some of the other
SF<00:03:43.170> but<00:03:43.380> see<00:03:43.560> how<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:44.130> one's<00:03:44.370> 210<00:03:45.030> but<00:03:45.720> it

recently<00:03:55.139> had<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.889> ridiculously<00:03:56.760> light<00:03:57.000> pickup

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
recently had a ridiculously light pickup

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.569 
recently had a ridiculously light pickup
I'll<00:03:57.750> say<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.470> picks<00:03:58.709> up<00:03:58.829> lighter<00:03:59.130> than<00:03:59.400> this

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
I'll say that picks up lighter than this

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.270 
I'll say that picks up lighter than this
and<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.079> still<00:04:01.410> think<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.889> up<00:04:02.040> there

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and but I still think this is up there

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.789 
and but I still think this is up there
as<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> lighter<00:04:03.620> feeling<00:04:04.620> as

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
as one of the lighter feeling as

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.440 
as one of the lighter feeling as
setbacks<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.639> we<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.880> them<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.269> feels

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
setbacks that we have them that it feels

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.690 
setbacks that we have them that it feels
bit<00:04:07.139> less<00:04:07.350> than<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.769> which<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.010> all<00:04:08.489> more

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
bit less than it is which is all more

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.979 
bit less than it is which is all more
impressive<00:04:09.150> when<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.299> consider<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.780> full

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
impressive when you consider the full

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.110 
impressive when you consider the full
profile<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:11.190> fact<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.430> has<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> mid<00:04:11.970> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
profile and the fact that has a mid to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.180 
profile and the fact that has a mid to
low<00:04:12.299> sweet<00:04:12.660> spot<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.470> one<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.769> reasons<00:04:14.069> it

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
low sweet spot and one of the reasons it

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.250 
low sweet spot and one of the reasons it
picks<00:04:14.400> up<00:04:14.639> well<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.239> there's<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.630> nice<00:04:15.870> bow

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
picks up well is there's that nice bow

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.300 
picks up well is there's that nice bow

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
especially down low that's really going

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.710 
especially down low that's really going

generally with front foreplay as well
with<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.610> bug<00:04:26.820> because<00:04:27.120> it's<00:04:27.270> got<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.510> mid

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
with this bug because it's got the mid

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.500 
with this bug because it's got the mid
slow<00:04:27.990> middle<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:29.490> great<00:04:29.790> for<00:04:30.030> use<00:04:30.240> on

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
slow middle and it's great for use on

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.240 
slow middle and it's great for use on
slow<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.020> low<00:04:31.170> pitches<00:04:31.470> or<00:04:31.830> anyone<00:04:32.130> who

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
worth considering I haven't done the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.180 
worth considering I haven't done the
specs<00:04:45.960> yeah<00:04:46.290> it's<00:04:46.440> quite<00:04:46.620> an<00:04:46.680> interesting<00:04:46.740> one

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
specs yeah it's quite an interesting one

specs yeah it's quite an interesting one
on<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.430> bat<00:04:47.670> look<00:04:48.330> at<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.540> edges<00:04:48.840> of<00:04:48.960> this

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
on this bat look at the edges of this

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.150 
on this bat look at the edges of this
138<00:04:49.980> millimeters<00:04:50.640> with<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.570> spine<00:04:52.020> of<00:04:52.160> 63

138 millimeters with a spine of 63
millimeters<00:04:53.840> which<00:04:54.840> were<00:04:54.990> battles<00:04:55.350> only

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
millimeters which were battles only

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.090 
millimeters which were battles only
cheap<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.980> 10<00:04:56.340> with<00:04:57.210> minimal<00:04:57.630> concaving<00:04:58.140> that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
cheap and 10 with minimal concaving that

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.040 
cheap and 10 with minimal concaving that
is<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.250> light<00:04:59.490> clef<00:04:59.850> that's<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.210> very<00:05:00.600> generous

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
is a light clef that's a very generous

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.870 
is a light clef that's a very generous
amount<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.350> wood<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> way<00:05:01.980> what's<00:05:02.700> also

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
amount of wood for the way what's also

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.280 
amount of wood for the way what's also
interesting<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.660> fact<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.170> other

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
interesting is the fact that the other

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.860 
interesting is the fact that the other
edge<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:05.070> right-handers<00:05:05.730> inside<00:05:06.240> edge<00:05:06.450> or

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
edge the right-handers inside edge or

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.680 
edge the right-handers inside edge or
the<00:05:07.140> left<00:05:07.560> fenders<00:05:07.950> outside<00:05:08.430> edge<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:09.360> thicker

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
the left fenders outside edge is thicker

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.780 
the left fenders outside edge is thicker
by<00:05:10.230> a<00:05:10.260> couple<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.650> millimeters<00:05:11.130> that's<00:05:11.280> 40

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
by a couple of millimeters that's 40

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.140 
by a couple of millimeters that's 40
maybe<00:05:12.000> 41<00:05:12.690> millimeters<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.790> we've

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
maybe 41 millimeters and so that we've

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.060 
maybe 41 millimeters and so that we've
seen<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.510> another<00:05:15.750> video<00:05:16.080> as<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.800> often

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
seen that another video as you you often

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.010 
seen that another video as you you often
see<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.669> sometimes<00:05:18.120> one<00:05:18.600> millimeter

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
see this this sometimes one millimeter

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.200 
see this this sometimes one millimeter
two<00:05:19.350> millimeter<00:05:19.710> difference<00:05:19.950> between<00:05:20.580> quite

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
two millimeter difference between quite

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.030 
two millimeter difference between quite
often<00:05:21.390> it's<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.780> right-handers<00:05:22.620> outside

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
often it's the right-handers outside

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.920 
often it's the right-handers outside
edge<00:05:23.190> that's<00:05:23.580> thicker<00:05:23.880> up<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.419> case<00:05:24.690> as<00:05:24.840> I

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
edge that's thicker up in this case as I

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.880 
edge that's thicker up in this case as I
feel<00:05:25.140> that<00:05:25.290> way<00:05:25.380> around<00:05:25.440> if<00:05:25.800> you're

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
feel that way around if you're

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.430 
feel that way around if you're
left-handed<00:05:26.340> this<00:05:27.300> was<00:05:27.630> simply<00:05:28.050> good<00:05:28.320> you're

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
left-handed this was simply good you're

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.830 
left-handed this was simply good you're
getting<00:05:28.530> more<00:05:28.800> generous<00:05:29.280> edge<00:05:29.669> on<00:05:30.630> your

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
looks really cool and so will the new

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.400 
looks really cool and so will the new
walk<00:06:10.290> all<00:06:11.160> this<00:06:11.460> for<00:06:11.790> price<00:06:12.890> 279<00:06:13.890> pounds<00:06:14.600> 99<00:06:15.600> so

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
walk all this for price 279 pounds 99 so

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.260 
walk all this for price 279 pounds 99 so
it's<00:06:16.830> lower<00:06:17.370> than<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.850> Black<00:06:18.120> Edition

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
it's lower than the Black Edition

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.270 
it's lower than the Black Edition
obviously<00:06:19.110> it's<00:06:19.320> also<00:06:19.620> lower<00:06:20.010> than<00:06:20.130> the

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
obviously it's also lower than the

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.670 
obviously it's also lower than the
optimist<00:06:20.880> but<00:06:21.750> it's<00:06:21.930> higher<00:06:22.229> than<00:06:22.260> the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
optimist but it's higher than the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.340 
optimist but it's higher than the
limited<00:06:23.130> edition<00:06:23.580> so<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:23.940> sits<00:06:24.300> right<00:06:25.110> at<00:06:25.260> the

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
limited edition so it sits right at the

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.950 
limited edition so it sits right at the
top<00:06:25.620> well<00:06:26.150> towards<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:27.300> top<00:06:27.510> but<00:06:27.690> not<00:06:27.720> the

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
top well towards the top but not the

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.719 
top well towards the top but not the
very<00:06:28.200> very<00:06:28.470> top<00:06:28.800> which<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.400> think<00:06:29.550> for<00:06:29.700> a

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
very very top which I think for a

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.210 
very very top which I think for a
