00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
but I didn't catch any fish so I might

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.140 
but I didn't catch any fish so I might
go<00:01:41.890> back<00:01:41.920> there<00:01:42.250> later<00:01:44.310> no<00:01:45.310> current<00:01:45.729> flying<00:01:46.060> at

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
go back there later no current flying at

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.100 
go back there later no current flying at
the<00:01:46.180> moment<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:46.990> Fisher<00:01:47.740> pretty<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.840> dos

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
the moment so Fisher pretty pretty dos

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
the moment so Fisher pretty pretty dos
are<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:51.220> also<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.520> bit<00:01:51.670> cold

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
are it's also a bit cold

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.820 
are it's also a bit cold
so<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.610> little<00:01:54.850> I'm<00:01:55.000> going<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.180> use
