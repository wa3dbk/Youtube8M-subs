00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
turn it on and off and here's where you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
turn it on and off and here's where you
put<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.679> gas<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> go<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> down

and then press the on button up near
your<00:01:49.539> yeah<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.080> might<00:01:51.259> take<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> while<00:01:51.710> cuz

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
your yeah that it might take a while cuz

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.160 
your yeah that it might take a while cuz
sometimes<00:01:52.220> it's<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.700> little<00:01:52.789> cold<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.899> takes

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
sometimes it's a little cold so it takes

00:01:54.170 --> 00:03:05.470 
sometimes it's a little cold so it takes
a<00:01:54.380> while<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.300> start

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.270 

okay<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.840> give<00:03:07.770> up

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
okay I give up

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.790 
okay I give up
but<00:03:08.820> yes<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.240> does<00:03:09.450> usually<00:03:09.720> start<00:03:10.410> about<00:03:10.740> I

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
but yes it does usually start about I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.980 
but yes it does usually start about I
just<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.250> keep<00:03:11.540> doing<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.660> until<00:03:12.900> it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
just have to keep doing that until it

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.340 
just have to keep doing that until it
starts<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.500> actually<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.400> did<00:03:15.000> write<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.840> quite

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
starts and actually I did write it quite

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.850 
starts and actually I did write it quite
a<00:03:16.380> bit

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
a bit

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.990 
a bit
so<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:18.240> problem<00:03:18.600> might<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.820> needs

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
so the problem might be that it needs

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.740 
so the problem might be that it needs
one<00:03:21.180> gas<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.790> don't<00:03:23.850> have<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> key<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.570> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
one gas and I don't have the key to the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.290 
one gas and I don't have the key to the
shed<00:03:25.410> right<00:03:25.560> now<00:03:25.740> so<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.220> can't<00:03:26.910> get<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> gas

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
shed right now so I can't get the gas

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.710 
shed right now so I can't get the gas
but<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.250> will<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.400> probably<00:03:29.820> will<00:03:30.120> make<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> video

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
but I will I probably will make a video

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.000 
but I will I probably will make a video
of<00:03:30.960> me<00:03:31.260> riding<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.670> guess<00:03:33.800> see<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.860> guys

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
keep trying to keep pulling that thing

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.430 
keep trying to keep pulling that thing
you<00:03:40.650> know<00:03:40.770> what<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.160> start
