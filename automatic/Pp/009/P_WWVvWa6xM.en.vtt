it's on 75% so each light is 25% and has

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's on 75% so each light is 25% and has
four<00:01:16.380> lights<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.270> here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
four lights right there and right here

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.200 
four lights right there and right here
got<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> microphone<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.460> speaker<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
got the microphone and the speaker and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
got the microphone and the speaker and
the<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.810> thing<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the good thing about this is the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
the good thing about this is the
speaker's<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> bottom<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.000> basically

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
speaker's not at the bottom so basically

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
speaker's not at the bottom so basically
it<00:01:24.600> directs<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> speaker<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.770> front<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it directs the speaker in front of you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.039 
it directs the speaker in front of you
instead<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.720> hand<00:01:27.900> like

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
instead so when you got your hand like

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
instead so when you got your hand like
this<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.320> doesn't<00:01:28.860> block<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> sound<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this it doesn't block the sound so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
this it doesn't block the sound so
that's<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> tailless

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's so that's one of the tailless

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.600 
that's so that's one of the tailless
talked<00:01:31.439> about<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> thing<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> I'll<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
talked about the thing that I'll do like

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.069 
talked about the thing that I'll do like
and<00:01:32.880> that's<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> main<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.049> about
