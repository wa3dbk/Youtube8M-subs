 showing and teaching this time to 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.910
 how to repair the views in thumbnails of 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.189
 your videos made by own experience 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.859
 I had this little problem in my 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.660
 pc before I saw the videos well 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.640
 then I do not know what happened and they went back 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.560
 everyone in this thumbnail view that does not 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.750
 it's not nice at all I thought it was 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.610
 this configuration but I was trying 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.440
 I tried but I did not know what was going on 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.930
 same wait my friend has something that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.210
 tell them to keep it in mind hello a 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.129
 I greet everyone good attention is not 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 although this configuration that I will 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.410
 soon do not fix the problem is 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.789
 necessary in the repair of the problem 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.010
 let's start first I have in this 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.739
 folder a video you goals in a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.780
 any folder they open it is not me anymore 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.660
 I have fixed the problem so that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.840
 see well video well let's organize 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.449
 then folder and search options in 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.420
 the drop-down here we go to the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.729
 selection see good here is necessary 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.230
 have this box active in which it says 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.630
 show thumbnail file icon 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.000
 if it is active, leave it as is 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.790
 ready this is first step pedro friend 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.620
 keeps narrating good once having in 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.210
 tell what my friend said and did 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.740
 what we are going to do is download the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.960
 program that left in the description 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.790
 of the video does not weigh much 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.040
 so they are left after being downloaded 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.960
 decompress and they have this executable 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.010
 or installer of the program we are going to 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.860
 run open double click right click and 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.720
 install etc. you already know them 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.580
 it seems this window give in next and 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.380
 successively they install it I do not 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.180
 install and because you have already given 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.730
 the miniatures are fine for this 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.830
 good program after finished with 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.930
 success will be executed only the program 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.060
 you open the access and your direct 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.700
 here simply leave everything as is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.860
 except this they go to the second box 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.930
 from above file format if here it happens be 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.120
 functional with all formats give you 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.190
 in selecting all select those that 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.260
 are not selected and ready 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.780
 they give in to you or apply in Spanish and it comes out 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.850
 of the program there is no need to 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.200
 open the program every time we start 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.629
 the pc 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.970
 the program does not run alone and does not come up 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.010
 pc performance not the pc follows 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.019
 just as if he had not executed 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.550
 no program does not even appear in 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.830
 the toolbar but the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.349
 program if it is in continuous use 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.269
 well that was all for today this is the 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.340
 better way not like this one of the codes 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.050
 in a text document and I do not know 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.970
 but at least to me this way 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.340
 repair the views with these codes does not 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.120
 it worked for me but the ones I showed you is 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.290
 100% functional thank you until next time 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.290
