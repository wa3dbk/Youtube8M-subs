00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so all I'm gonna do is run to the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
so all I'm gonna do is run to the
microwave<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> melt<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.910> increments

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
microwave and melt this in increments

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.549 
microwave and melt this in increments
I'm<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> start<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.110> minute<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
I'm going to start with one minute and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.900 
I'm going to start with one minute and
then<00:00:43.829> stir<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.460> we'll<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.789> from

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
then stir it and then we'll go from

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
then stir it and then we'll go from
there<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.260> after<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.860> minute

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

there so here it is after one minute
you'll<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> still<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:47.910> its<00:00:48.090> shape

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to melt so all I wanted to do at this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.790 
to melt so all I wanted to do at this
point<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.660> Stewart<00:00:51.989> real<00:00:52.199> thoroughly<00:00:52.620> make

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
point this Stewart real thoroughly make

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.959 
point this Stewart real thoroughly make
sure<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.370> from<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> bottom<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
sure you get it up from the bottom so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.810 
sure you get it up from the bottom so
you<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.329> burnt<00:00:54.600> spots<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:56.070> once

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you don't get burnt spots and then once

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
you don't get burnt spots and then once
you<00:00:56.969> feel<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.420> stirred<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:58.020> around

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
you feel like it's stirred all around

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.389 
you feel like it's stirred all around
pretty<00:00:58.559> well<00:00:58.710> we're<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> put<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
pretty well we're going to put it in the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
pretty well we're going to put it in the
microwave<00:00:59.699> again<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.270> about<00:01:00.480> 40<00:01:00.870> more

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.549 
microwave again for about 40 more
seconds<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> stir<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.559> okay

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
seconds and stir it one more time okay

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
seconds and stir it one more time okay
so<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.070> after<00:01:05.250> another<00:01:05.640> 40<00:01:06.000> seconds

maybe<00:01:12.810> try<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> few<00:01:13.409> seconds<00:01:13.799> less<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.250> maybe

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
maybe try a few seconds less like maybe

second 3 months after that this is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.789 
second 3 months after that this is
looking<00:01:18.840> pretty<00:01:18.900> good<00:01:19.170> even<00:01:19.560> though<00:01:19.619> there's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
looking pretty good even though there's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
looking pretty good even though there's
a<00:01:19.830> few<00:01:20.009> lumps<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.490> there<00:01:20.700> there's<00:01:21.060> enough<00:01:21.299> heat

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
a few lumps in there there's enough heat

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
a few lumps in there there's enough heat
in<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> stir<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.610> getting

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
in here that as I stir it it's getting

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
in here that as I stir it it's getting
nice<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> smooth<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.930> definitely<00:01:25.560> don't

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
nice and smooth you definitely don't

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.109 
nice and smooth you definitely don't
want<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> overcook<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.490> chocolate<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
want to overcook your chocolate it can
burn<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.560> looks<00:01:28.740> nice<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:28.950> smooth

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
burn so that looks nice and smooth

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
burn so that looks nice and smooth
really<00:01:30.000> easy<00:01:30.240> second<00:01:31.110> step<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> you're

stretch a little bit farther that's fine
as<00:01:40.290> well<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.220> makes<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> makes<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880

all<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.989> one<00:02:43.110> piece<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.190> easy

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
all up in one piece and it's really easy

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.559 
all up in one piece and it's really easy
to<00:02:44.459> break<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.849> can<00:02:44.970> break<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.269> either<00:02:45.390> in

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
to break you can break it either in

look how really great this looks when
you<00:02:50.069> crack<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.549> open<00:02:50.760> about<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> color<00:02:52.049> in<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
you crack it open about the color in it

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.470 
you crack it open about the color in it
it's<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.340> pretty<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:53.819> have<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> really<00:02:54.299> good

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's really pretty I have a really good

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.000 
it's really pretty I have a really good
idea<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.989> about<00:02:55.140> packaging<00:02:55.680> your<00:02:55.769> bark

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
idea for you about packaging your bark

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.920 
idea for you about packaging your bark
as<00:02:56.190> well<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.910> what<00:02:57.060> I've<00:02:57.150> got<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:57.390> are<00:02:57.720> a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
as well so what I've got here are a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.650 
as well so what I've got here are a
couple<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.440> treat<00:02:58.799> bags<00:02:59.040> these<00:02:59.489> are<00:02:59.660> really

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
couple of treat bags these are really

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.420 
couple of treat bags these are really
just<00:03:00.810> piping<00:03:01.049> bags<00:03:01.349> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.739> also<00:03:01.920> use<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
just piping bags you can also use the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.150 
just piping bags you can also use the
squared<00:03:02.700> off<00:03:02.910> clear<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.900> tree<00:03:04.799> bags<00:03:05.010> if

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
squared off clear like tree bags if

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
squared off clear like tree bags if
you'd<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.849> then<00:03:06.299> whatever<00:03:06.599> color

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
you'd like to and then whatever color

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.600 
you'd like to and then whatever color
ribbon<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.620> coordinates<00:03:08.099> with<00:03:08.220> what<00:03:08.459> you're
