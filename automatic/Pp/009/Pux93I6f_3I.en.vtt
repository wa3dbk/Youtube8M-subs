00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
pretty hollow up here under the under

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.910 
pretty hollow up here under the under
side<00:01:08.270> seems<00:01:08.630> like<00:01:08.780> Legos<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.470> figuring<00:01:09.920> out

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
side seems like Legos is figuring out

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.790 
side seems like Legos is figuring out
how<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.430> get<00:01:10.640> more<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.119> more<00:01:11.150> lean<00:01:11.570> as<00:01:12.440> far<00:01:12.650> as

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
how to get more and more lean as far as

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.170 
how to get more and more lean as far as
being<00:01:12.979> able<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.310> build<00:01:13.520> up<00:01:13.640> their<00:01:13.790> models

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
being able to build up their models

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.359 
being able to build up their models
using<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.990> least<00:01:15.290> amount<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.860> bricks<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
using the least amount of bricks and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.600 
using the least amount of bricks and
still<00:01:16.550> have<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.790> same<00:01:17.560> aesthetic<00:01:18.560> effect<00:01:18.979> as

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
still have the same aesthetic effect as

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.889 
still have the same aesthetic effect as
far<00:01:19.850> as<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.060> way<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.270> looks<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.570> everything

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
far as the way it looks and everything

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.469 
far as the way it looks and everything
okay<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.250> one<00:01:22.490> thing<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.759> want<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:22.940> do<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.090> you

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
okay so one thing I want to do is you

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.330 
okay so one thing I want to do is you
know<00:01:23.930> there's<00:01:24.200> there's<00:01:24.409> a<00:01:24.530> big<00:01:24.710> trend<00:01:24.950> as<00:01:25.190> far

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
know there's there's a big trend as far

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.880 
know there's there's a big trend as far
as<00:01:25.490> if<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:26.060> LEGO<00:01:26.390> sets<00:01:26.720> retire<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.649> missed

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
as if if LEGO sets retire and you missed

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.410 
as if if LEGO sets retire and you missed
out<00:01:28.070> on<00:01:28.100> them<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:29.000> know<00:01:29.090> they<00:01:29.119> have<00:01:29.390> a

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
out on them you know they have a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570 
out on them you know they have a
tendency<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.680> get<00:01:30.770> expensive<00:01:31.159> if<00:01:31.490> you

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
tendency to to get expensive if you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.550 
tendency to to get expensive if you
missed<00:01:31.789> out<00:01:31.940> on<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.810> there<00:01:33.110> seems<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.440> be<00:01:33.530> a

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
missed out on but there seems to be a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.290 
missed out on but there seems to be a
common<00:01:33.950> thread<00:01:34.460> going<00:01:34.700> here<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.119> if<00:01:35.210> you

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
common thread going here that if you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.760 
common thread going here that if you
miss<00:01:35.479> out<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.660> some<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.170> lego<00:01:36.350> creator

don't worry this is the one that came
out<00:01:59.780> before<00:01:59.929> that<00:02:01.030> lego<00:02:02.030> creator<00:02:02.080> same<00:02:03.080> scale

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
out before that lego creator same scale

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.740 
out before that lego creator same scale
and<00:02:05.360> don't<00:02:05.570> worry<00:02:05.780> if<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.380> missed<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.770> one

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
and don't worry if you missed that one

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.259 
and don't worry if you missed that one
there's<00:02:08.750> always<00:02:09.019> this<00:02:09.170> one<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.910> point<00:02:11.060> is

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
there's always this one so the point is

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.690 
there's always this one so the point is
is<00:02:11.600> if<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.829> lego<00:02:13.100> set<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.670> you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
out on it don't worry it's most likely

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.500 
out on it don't worry it's most likely
that<00:02:18.430> lego<00:02:19.430> will<00:02:19.670> probably<00:02:20.000> release<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that lego will probably release a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.210 
that lego will probably release a
another<00:02:20.720> version<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.290> before<00:02:21.560> long<00:02:21.860> so

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
another version of it before long so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.060 
another version of it before long so
these<00:02:22.640> are<00:02:22.850> just<00:02:23.000> three<00:02:23.350> small<00:02:24.350> lego<00:02:24.680> creator

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
these are just three small lego creator

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.039 
these are just three small lego creator
cars<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:26.090> are<00:02:26.209> all<00:02:26.329> pretty<00:02:26.570> much<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.840> same

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
cars that are all pretty much the same

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.440 
cars that are all pretty much the same
scale<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> latest<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.060> come<00:02:29.239> out

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
scale this is the latest one to come out

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.270 
scale this is the latest one to come out
and<00:02:29.720> they're<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.680> pretty<00:02:30.860> much<00:02:30.980> identical

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
and they're all pretty much identical

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.640 
and they're all pretty much identical
except<00:02:32.209> for<00:02:32.239> color<00:02:32.660> they're<00:02:33.380> all<00:02:33.500> identical

in<00:02:34.130> size<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.200> newest<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:36.650> is

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
in size this one the newest one is

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.620 
in size this one the newest one is
actually<00:02:37.100> got<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.670> fewest<00:02:38.030> number<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.360> pieces

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
actually got the fewest number of pieces

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.630 
actually got the fewest number of pieces
has<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.890> least<00:02:40.070> amount<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.430> functionality

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
has the least amount of functionality

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.240 
has the least amount of functionality
all<00:02:41.239> these<00:02:41.390> others<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.840> doors<00:02:42.049> open<00:02:42.590> things

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
all these others the doors open things

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.800 
all these others the doors open things
like<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.609> this<00:02:43.880> one<00:02:44.030> has<00:02:44.060> no<00:02:44.180> functionality

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
like that this one has no functionality

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.289 
like that this one has no functionality
the<00:02:45.140> doors<00:02:45.380> don't<00:02:45.620> open<00:02:46.000> anything<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.269> that

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
the doors don't open anything like that

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.830 
the doors don't open anything like that
so<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:49.250> actually<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.630> little

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
so I actually it's a little

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.210 
so I actually it's a little
disappointment<00:02:51.470> as<00:02:51.590> compared<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.040> other

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
disappointment as compared to the other

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.390 
disappointment as compared to the other
three<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.820> is<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.480> same<00:02:53.859> category<00:02:54.859> as

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
three but it is in the same category as

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.550 
three but it is in the same category as
these<00:02:55.579> other<00:02:55.790> three<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.239> anyway<00:02:56.780> guys<00:02:56.930> the
