00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you put them in and then you have the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.849 
you put them in and then you have the
positive<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.840> too<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.740> will

on so you open the door key or unlock it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.890 
on so you open the door key or unlock it
from<00:02:13.890> outside<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> key<00:02:14.609> they'll<00:02:15.420> pop<00:02:15.660> on

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
from outside with the key they'll pop on

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.850 
from outside with the key they'll pop on
so<00:02:16.530> let<00:02:16.980> me<00:02:17.070> just<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.830 

you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.710 

alright<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.080> there's<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.470> plug<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.600> will

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
alright so there's the plug and it will

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.200 
alright so there's the plug and it will
already<00:02:31.960> have<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:33.010> two<00:02:33.280> wires<00:02:33.550> actually<00:02:33.910> in

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
already have the two wires actually in

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.510 
already have the two wires actually in
it<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> then<00:02:34.900> all<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.230> do<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.220> pin

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
it and then all you do is you get a pin

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.350 
it and then all you do is you get a pin
connector<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.380> attach<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.970> end<00:02:40.150> of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
connector you attach that to the end of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.760 
connector you attach that to the end of
your<00:02:40.950> positive<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.310> ground<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.620> plug<00:02:44.620> them

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
your positive and ground you plug them

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.560 
your positive and ground you plug them
in<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.160> same<00:02:45.430> hole<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.030> you've<00:02:46.150> one<00:02:46.390> of

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
in in the same hole so you've one of

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.090 
in in the same hole so you've one of
those<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:47.050> ground<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.620> positive<00:02:47.770> I'm

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
those is ground and one is positive I'm

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.710 
those is ground and one is positive I'm
not<00:02:48.340> sure<00:02:48.550> which<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.880> which<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.480> plug

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
not sure which is which you just plug

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.610 
not sure which is which you just plug
them<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:51.100> plug<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.610> back<00:02:51.880> in<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
them in and then plug that back in to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.230 
them in and then plug that back in to
the<00:02:55.709> where<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.890> goes<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.610> actual<00:02:57.910> car

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
the where it goes in in the actual car

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.070 
the where it goes in in the actual car
and<00:02:59.130> then<00:03:00.130> open<00:03:00.910> your<00:03:01.030> door<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:01.930> it

and then open your door and see if it

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.980 
and then open your door and see if it
works<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:03.670> pretty<00:03:04.030> much<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.600> aside

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
works and that's pretty much it aside

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.990 
works and that's pretty much it aside
from<00:03:05.200> like<00:03:05.350> hiding<00:03:05.800> wires<00:03:06.040> under<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> mats

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
from like hiding wires under the mats

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.190 
from like hiding wires under the mats
and<00:03:07.270> stuff<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:09.010> all<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:10.020> planning<00:03:11.020> out
