00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
in first Corinthians 15 how the Apostle

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.910 
in first Corinthians 15 how the Apostle
Paul<00:02:26.930> makes<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.290> analogy

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
Paul makes this analogy

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.000

in their glory and the way they appear

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.920 
in their glory and the way they appear
and<00:02:33.740> how<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.100> shine<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:35.810> we're

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and how they shine and I think we're

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.830 
and how they shine and I think we're
going<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.520> distinctions<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:38.330> terms<00:02:38.690> of
