00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.869 

got<00:00:03.870> an<00:00:04.020> inch<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.319> snow<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.370> driveway<00:00:05.670> I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
got an inch of snow and the driveway I

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.709 
got an inch of snow and the driveway I
need<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.589> shovel<00:00:07.589> before<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.599> melts<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.690> little

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
need to shovel before it melts a little

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.310 
need to shovel before it melts a little
bit<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.200> turns<00:00:10.380> into<00:00:10.590> ice<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:12.320> course

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
bit and turns into ice and course

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.000 
bit and turns into ice and course
traditionally<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:17.869> would<00:00:18.869> use<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> these

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.370 

but<00:00:24.500> it's<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:27.230> user-friendly<00:00:28.230> as

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
but it's just not that user-friendly as

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.650 
but it's just not that user-friendly as
far<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.920> getting<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.760> large<00:00:30.390> area<00:00:30.869> done<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.619> once

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
far as getting a large area done at once

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:58.869 
far as getting a large area done at once
especially<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> lights<00:00:34.200> fluffy<00:00:34.710> stuff

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.600 

now<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.289> did<00:01:02.539> use<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:04.080> push<00:01:04.350> broom<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.339> used

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
now I did use my push broom I have used

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.800 
now I did use my push broom I have used
my<00:01:05.729> push<00:01:06.000> broom<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:07.430> couple<00:01:08.430> times<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
my push broom a couple times because it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
my push broom a couple times because it
was<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:11.400> convenient<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.030> didn't<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
was just convenient I didn't want to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
was just convenient I didn't want to
drag<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.170> shovel<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> shovel<00:01:14.490> made

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
drag out the shovel and the shovel made

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.800 
drag out the shovel and the shovel made
a<00:01:14.670> lot<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> noise<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.570> pretty

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a lot of noise and it was pretty

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.550 
a lot of noise and it was pretty
effective<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> found<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> push

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
effective but I found that the push

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
effective but I found that the push
broom<00:01:20.600> was<00:01:22.880> not<00:01:23.880> wide<00:01:24.150> enough<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.810> plus<00:01:25.140> my

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
broom was not wide enough and plus my

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.700 
broom was not wide enough and plus my
last<00:01:25.920> stick<00:01:26.520> broke<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.330> left<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> out

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
last stick broke I left it out

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:49.330 
last stick broke I left it out
and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.159> broke<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> stick

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.020 

so<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.619> did<00:01:52.689> was<00:01:53.689> I<00:01:53.869> came<00:01:53.930> up<00:01:54.290> with<00:01:54.320> a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
so what I did was I came up with a

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.960 
so what I did was I came up with a
redneck<00:01:56.030> snow<00:01:56.390> pusher<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:57.820> got<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> piece<00:01:59.180> of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
redneck snow pusher I got a piece of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.590 
redneck snow pusher I got a piece of
pallet<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.740> stuck<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.670> piece

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
pallet and I just stuck it on this piece

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.880 
pallet and I just stuck it on this piece
of<00:02:05.659> wood<00:02:05.869> here<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:06.110> couple<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.500> things<00:02:06.679> I<00:02:06.830> would

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
of wood here a couple of things I would

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.999 
of wood here a couple of things I would
do<00:02:07.700> modify<00:02:08.450> as<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.750> drowned<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.470> off<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> little

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
do modify as I drowned that off a little

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.120 
do modify as I drowned that off a little
bit<00:02:10.099> better<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.510> was<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.930> trial<00:02:12.260> trial

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
bit better but it was just a trial trial

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.839 
bit better but it was just a trial trial
deal<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.690> mounted<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:19.640> little

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
deal and but I mounted it to a little

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.259 
deal and but I mounted it to a little
wedge<00:02:20.120> block<00:02:20.360> here<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:22.549> couple<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.880> drywall

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
wedge block here so a couple of drywall

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.500 
wedge block here so a couple of drywall
screws<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.810> did<00:02:23.989> have<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.200> brace<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.680> up

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
screws and I did have to brace it up

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.840 
screws and I did have to brace it up
because<00:02:26.709> because<00:02:27.709> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.950> torque<00:02:28.280> left<00:02:28.670> and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
because because of the torque left and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.330 
because because of the torque left and
right<00:02:28.970> torque<00:02:29.299> I<00:02:29.799> didn't<00:02:30.799> want<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> rip<00:02:31.160> these

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
right torque I didn't want to rip these

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.370 
right torque I didn't want to rip these
screws<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:31.819> but<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.930> working<00:02:33.230> pretty

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
screws out but this is working pretty

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:52.240 
screws out but this is working pretty
good<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.830> let's<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.459> action<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> big

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
good so let's see this in action so big

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.050 
good so let's see this in action so big
difference<00:02:53.380> here's<00:02:54.380> my<00:02:54.670> raid<00:02:55.670> with<00:02:55.850> snow

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
difference here's my raid with snow

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.630 
difference here's my raid with snow
shovel<00:02:56.450> here's<00:02:57.049> my<00:02:57.230> redneck<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.040> snow<00:02:58.280> pusher

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640

shovel here's my redneck it snow pusher
and<00:02:58.760> what<00:02:58.910> I'll<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.560> I'll<00:03:00.560> actually<00:03:00.859> just

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
and what I'll do is I'll actually just

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.550 
and what I'll do is I'll actually just
either<00:03:01.880> push<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.390> up<00:03:02.510> against<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.989> retaining

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
either push it up against the retaining

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.880 
either push it up against the retaining
wall<00:03:03.769> there<00:03:04.630> or<00:03:05.630> I'll<00:03:06.049> just<00:03:06.260> push<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.769> all<00:03:06.859> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
wall there or I'll just push it all the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.800 
wall there or I'll just push it all the
way<00:03:07.130> out<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> back<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.540> way<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> don't

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
way out to the back and that way I don't

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.890 
way out to the back and that way I don't
have<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.079> scoop<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.370> shovel<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.790> over<00:03:11.090> but

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
have to scoop it and shovel it over but

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.210 
have to scoop it and shovel it over but
it<00:03:12.019> does<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> good<00:03:12.410> job<00:03:14.799> you<00:03:15.799> see<00:03:15.980> some

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.509 
it does a good job you see some
semblance<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.880> driveway<00:03:17.359> there<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.650> I'm

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
semblance of a driveway there but I'm

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.740 
semblance of a driveway there but I'm
gonna<00:03:19.670> go<00:03:20.709> time<00:03:21.709> lapse<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.720> show<00:03:23.720> you

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
gonna go time lapse this and show you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.170 
gonna go time lapse this and show you
how<00:03:23.930> fast<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.410> goes<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:25.010> redneck<00:03:25.940> snow

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
how fast it goes with the redneck snow

00:03:26.180 --> 00:04:12.460 
how fast it goes with the redneck snow
pusher

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.090 

so<00:04:13.470> there<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.650> go
