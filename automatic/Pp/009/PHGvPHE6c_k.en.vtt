00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.050
 Hello 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.230
 today's proposal is sweet tomato 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.500
 that with these hard prices 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.250
 that is already the chopped tomato do the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.680
 sweet and with this gesture more than chopped 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.640
 I'm going to do it 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.090
 chosen as they taught me and I like 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.900
 brown sugar 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.510
 and something that can not be missed or can be 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.910
 replace 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.750
 the tonic of a tomato candy is the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.989
 boar first step is already the pan 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.989
 to the fire we are going to put the sugar 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.479
 of candy then 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.009
 after returning half the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.009
 liquid of this wonder 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.579
 I'm going to put vanilla 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.579
 observe 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.689
 see that it was practically more than one 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.689
 large scoop 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.260
 I had left him in a seven and a half 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 I'm going to leave it in a 7 and let's leave it 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.180
 there to the fire and we will be observing the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.180
 systematically 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.629
 notice how to continue living 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.250
 and when it threatens to go up though now 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.520
 it is less because it has been decreasing 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.830
 I'll return them 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.800
 remember that for these two cans of 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.350
 tomato I introduce 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.350
 I had put in two cups of sugar 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.040
 look at how it looks 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.430
 and I've had to lower the fire of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.209
 new 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.209
 of revolver 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.739
 so that it does not stick 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.170
 and now before downloading it 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.170
 we put vanilla again 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.450
 we stir 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.500
 and we already closed the fire and our sweet 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.370
 she is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.730
 and we remove it immediately from the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.730
 burner 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.230
 lets go 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.040
 now we let it cool and I'm going to 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.560
 show how friends live 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.680
 here we have it 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.020
 and see the variants the suggestions with 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.230
 that you can eat quesito creams 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:56.630
 cookies there are those who make smoothie with 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:00.680
 finally milk on toast in the end choose 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.650
