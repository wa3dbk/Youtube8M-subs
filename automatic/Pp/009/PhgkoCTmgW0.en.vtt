kind of scared and it's not pleasant to
have<00:01:00.500> these<00:01:00.770> sort<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:01.160> psychological<00:01:01.670> deaths

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
have these sort of psychological deaths

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.140 
have these sort of psychological deaths
every<00:01:02.960> day<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.560> just<00:01:03.740> gets<00:01:03.980> frustrating<00:01:04.430> and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
every day it just gets frustrating and

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150 
every day it just gets frustrating and
boring<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.780> I'm<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.470> fed<00:01:06.680> up<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:07.010> being

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
boring and I'm just fed up of being

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.700 
boring and I'm just fed up of being
scared<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.060> not<00:01:08.480> making<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.500> full

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
scared and not making that full

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.560 
scared and not making that full
commitment<00:01:10.160> I'd<00:01:10.310> rather<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:10.880> step<00:01:11.210> over<00:01:11.480> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
commitment I'd rather just step over the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.680 
commitment I'd rather just step over the
line<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.290> go<00:01:12.680> forward<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.730> a<00:01:14.000> way<00:01:14.240> that's

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
line and go forward in a way that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.590 
line and go forward in a way that's
meaningful<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.920> way<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.700> makes<00:01:17.090> at<00:01:17.540> least

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
meaningful in a way that makes at least

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.250 
meaningful in a way that makes at least
an<00:01:18.050> attempt<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:19.100> establish<00:01:19.840> change<00:01:20.840> that

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
an attempt to establish change that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.440 
an attempt to establish change that
first<00:01:21.500> step<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.890> quite<00:01:22.100> terrifying<00:01:22.580> but<00:01:23.180> once

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
first step is quite terrifying but once

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.510 
first step is quite terrifying but once
you've<00:01:23.660> made<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:24.710> actually<00:01:25.160> find<00:01:25.370> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
you've made it you actually find the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.850 
you've made it you actually find the
next<00:01:25.970> step<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.660> much<00:01:26.960> much<00:01:27.260> easier<00:01:27.320> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
next step on is much much easier and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.830 
next step on is much much easier and
from<00:01:28.310> there<00:01:28.580> it<00:01:28.790> gets<00:01:28.910> easier<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.659> gets

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
from there it gets easier and it gets

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.620 
from there it gets easier and it gets
quicker<00:01:30.140> what<00:01:30.740> turns<00:01:31.190> from<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.730> step<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.600> a

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
quicker what turns from a step to a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.800 
quicker what turns from a step to a
stride<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> pace<00:01:34.040> turns<00:01:34.550> into<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.880> run<00:01:35.180> turns

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
stride to a pace turns into a run turns

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.290 
stride to a pace turns into a run turns
into<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300
