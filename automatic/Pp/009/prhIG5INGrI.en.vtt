00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm going to put some oil on the pan

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:18.433
and I turn on

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:24.600
Now we prepare the brown of carrots

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:25.813
celery

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:31.255
and onion

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:43.300
In this moment we put the minced meat

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:49.200
bought in net, I mean without fat

00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:58.500
Now we turn and cut in pieces our minced

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:05.500
We put a pinch of salt, just for the meat

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:17.100
I put some nutmeg, only a little

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.100
and then, I shade the minced with the wine

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.500
Now we proceed to the preparation of the ragout (Put the peeled tomatoes and cherry tomatoes, amount at your free own)

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.500
In my way, I don't know if you do it like this too

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.134
Some garlic

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:38.300
Some basil

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.000
Some celery raw

00:01:43.254 --> 00:01:44.254
Salt

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:48.700
I don't know if other put it, a spoon of sugar

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:52.700
to soften the tomato

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:58.900
After that, I turn on and I let cook the tomato

00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:02.100
Earlier, I forgot to say

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.700
that on the ragout, I use to put some concentrate of tomato

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.100
On this case, it's this one

00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:15.900
so, I'll put two and half spoons

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.200
At the first cooking of the sauce

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.900
of the ragout

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.400
I put the peas

00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:31.200
I add the brown with the minced

00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:34.300
which is the ragout

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520
This is the ragout finished

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:48.000
This is how the consistence of the ragout will be

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.100
Here's the pasta with the ragout

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.400
with enough parmigiano

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:57.800
it'll be delicious

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.600
Then, with the same ragout we can do the baked pasta, but I'll show you on the next video

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.100
Thank you for following me and see you on the next recipes
