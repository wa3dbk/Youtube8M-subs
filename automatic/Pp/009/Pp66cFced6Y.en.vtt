50 or so the past couple days I've been
really<00:01:49.429> powering<00:01:49.939> out<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.539> levels<00:01:50.869> just

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
really powering out the levels just

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.260 
really powering out the levels just
trying<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.859> really<00:01:52.070> set<00:01:52.340> up<00:01:52.460> my<00:01:52.579> skill<00:01:52.880> trees

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
trying to really set up my skill trees

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.690 
trying to really set up my skill trees

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and you know just get up to the to the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.859 
and you know just get up to the to the
level<00:01:55.999> cap<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:56.329> that's<00:01:56.450> kind<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.630> what<00:01:56.780> I've

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
level cap so that's kind of what I've

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.279 
level cap so that's kind of what I've
been<00:01:56.929> doing<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:58.539> again<00:01:59.539> escalation<00:02:00.109> like<00:02:00.200> I

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
been doing and again escalation like I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.989 
been doing and again escalation like I
said<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.530> pretty<00:02:00.679> fun<00:02:00.890> game<00:02:00.920> mode<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.579> seem<00:02:01.939> to

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
said it's pretty fun game mode I seem to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.580 
said it's pretty fun game mode I seem to
always<00:02:02.119> get<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.359> good<00:02:02.570> bit<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:02.960> kills<00:02:03.259> from<00:02:03.439> it

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
always get a good bit of kills from it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.810 
always get a good bit of kills from it
because<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.799> always<00:02:03.920> seem<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.219> flank<00:02:04.460> enemies

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
because I always seem to flank enemies

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.249 
because I always seem to flank enemies
pretty<00:02:05.030> well<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.630> always<00:02:05.780> seem<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:06.020> get<00:02:06.170> him

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
pretty well and I always seem to get him

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.690 
pretty well and I always seem to get him
sidetracked<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:06.979> for<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.219> i<00:02:07.280> do<00:02:07.399> like

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
sidetracked so for that i do like

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.639 
sidetracked so for that i do like
escalation<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.929> unfortunate<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.530> i

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
escalation it's unfortunate that i

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.170 
escalation it's unfortunate that i

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
not very good and I think mag in terms

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.000 
not very good and I think mag in terms
of<00:03:00.239> consistency<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:01.319> terms<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.650> consistency

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
of consistency in terms of consistency

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.059 
of consistency in terms of consistency
of<00:03:02.430> its<00:03:02.579> gameplay<00:03:03.140> actually<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.319> an<00:03:04.500> arm<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
of its gameplay actually is an arm and a

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.800 
of its gameplay actually is an arm and a
leg<00:03:05.099> above<00:03:05.609> most<00:03:05.910> games<00:03:06.209> i'm<00:03:06.420> going<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.629> say

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
leg above most games i'm going to say

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.630 
leg above most games i'm going to say
even<00:03:07.409> its<00:03:07.530> consistency<00:03:08.099> is<00:03:08.340> better<00:03:08.519> than

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
even its consistency is better than

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.300 
even its consistency is better than

at least from the evidence that I see in

at least from the evidence that I see in
the<00:04:39.620> stats<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.280> think<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:41.000> lot<00:04:41.450> of<00:04:41.510> people

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
it's not what they're used to it's

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.390 
it's not what they're used to it's
completely<00:04:45.170> different<00:04:45.590> it's<00:04:45.710> not<00:04:45.950> like<00:04:46.190> a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
completely different it's not like a

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.340 
completely different it's not like a
call<00:04:46.640> of<00:04:46.820> duty<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.630> think<00:04:47.690> that's<00:04:47.900> why<00:04:48.140> not

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
call of duty and I think that's why not

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.930

consistent and it plays like it should

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.980 
consistent and it plays like it should
it<00:04:55.580> does<00:04:55.730> not<00:04:55.880> play<00:04:56.120> differently<00:04:56.570> from<00:04:56.750> game

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
it does not play differently from game

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.460 
it does not play differently from game
to<00:04:57.020> game<00:04:57.170> which<00:04:57.590> is<00:04:57.620> how<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> game<00:04:58.730> should<00:04:59.120> be

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
to game which is how a game should be

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.900 
to game which is how a game should be
and<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.680> know<00:05:00.920> I've<00:05:01.160> said<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.430> word<00:05:01.550> generic

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
and I know I've said the word generic

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.090 
and I know I've said the word generic
over<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.270> over<00:05:02.330> but<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:03.650> know<00:05:03.740> if<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.920> game

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
over and over but you know if the game

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.680 
over and over but you know if the game
is<00:05:04.280> generic<00:05:04.640> a<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.330> what<00:05:05.540> it<00:05:05.630> is

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
is generic a that it is what it is

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.000 
is generic a that it is what it is
obviously<00:05:06.110> there's<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> lot<00:05:06.410> of<00:05:06.530> shit<00:05:06.830> going

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
obviously there's a lot of shit going

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.010 
obviously there's a lot of shit going
down<00:05:07.100> on<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.460> map<00:05:07.720> there's<00:05:08.720> going<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:08.990> be

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
down on the map there's going to be

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.510 
down on the map there's going to be
situations<00:05:09.800> where<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.010> graphic<00:05:10.370> engine

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
situations where the graphic engine

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.510 
situations where the graphic engine
obviously<00:05:11.180> has<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.360> be<00:05:11.600> scaled<00:05:11.870> down<00:05:11.960> for<00:05:12.290> that

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
obviously has to be scaled down for that

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.950 
obviously has to be scaled down for that
