00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
nearly replicate it now all you have to

nearly replicate it now all you have to
do<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.710> hang<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.430> picture<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> lunar

do is hang a picture of the lunar

do is hang a picture of the lunar

landscape on the wall in front of you

landscape on the wall in front of you
cue<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.030> theme<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.629> 2001<00:02:10.849> well<00:02:11.849> that's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
cue up the theme from 2001 well that's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.390 
cue up the theme from 2001 well that's
one<00:02:12.270> small<00:02:12.540> step<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:12.840> man

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
one small step for man

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.520 
one small step for man
and<00:02:13.489> certainly<00:02:14.329> one<00:02:14.780> giant<00:02:15.349> leap<00:02:15.470> for

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and certainly one giant leap for

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.730 
and certainly one giant leap for
