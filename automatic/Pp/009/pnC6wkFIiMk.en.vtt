00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so let's perform the unboxing 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.960
 first impressions and an analysis of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
 these headphones have sounds board 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.190
 let's go to it good let's see what 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 we have inside the packaging of these 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.640
 headphones we remove the blue cap like 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 you see good this is a rubber that goes to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 protect what is the headphones and the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.630
 we have in a package as you see from 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.580
 plastic 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 let's remove it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.630
 now this on the one hand we remove this 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 plastic housing because they are the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.550
 instructions how it works so what 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 which is next to the ipod of the iphone and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.180
 ipad also product warranty 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.280
 12 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.170
 and as for the accessories, well, 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.600
 here we have a cable that will serve 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.700
 to lengthen the cable that already comes 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.739
 incorporated next to the headphones and what 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.650
 we put for example a backpack or in a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.510
 in a bag or in a pocket from a 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.680
 little further so here we have a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.229
 extension cable and on the other hand we have 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.460
 what are the spare parts for the ears 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.760
 either size s or size I already 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.979
 than the size m that is the size 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.960
 medium or conventional because it's coming 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.610
 included in the headphones as you see the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.280
 cover is the same color as the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.860
 headphones has a similar feel like 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.869
 if it was neoprene fabric and well 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.880
 will serve so that here inside 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.770
 let's incorporate, for example, the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.590
 headphones also fits for rubber bands 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.690
 good keys it's good that we have a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.869
 cover to protect them and we're going to 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.460
 transport what is good then now 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.680
 let's see what is in detail the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.740
 earphone as you can see is a headset that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.480
 it surrounds us the ear but it gets 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.850
 inside the ear 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.760
 and well then what is in the ovule 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 this white part that is silicone is 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.620
 will incorporate perfectly and thus for 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.990
 what we have been able to prove this way in the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.700
 first impressions are pretty 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.460
 comfortable now then we're going to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.770
 try during various sessions of 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.590
 sport to see if how they fit 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.630
 if they fall or if not as we have commented 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.840
 These headphones are designed to 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.490
 work next to the iphone or the ipad and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 this is because they have as you see 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.800
 here a command that will allow us 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.930
 raise and lower the volume with these three 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.760
 buttons well two of them those of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 the ends allow to raise and lower the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 volume and the middle button is going to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.170
 allow good as we have always 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.810
 seen in other headphones if we keep 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.150
 pressed we will be able to activate yes that is 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 the apple voice assistant but 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.110
 also good because it will allow us 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.240
 answer calls with the microphone that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.510
 is located in this back part of 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.130
 I 'm going to be able to perform 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.100
 voice calls using these headphones 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.260
 therefore good because it's one thing 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.630
 it is very grateful and that others 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.730
 headphones unfortunately do not have 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.920
 also as you see has a clamp that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.750
 will allow us to grasp what is the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.120
 headphone cable in our 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.620
 T-shirt or jacket for good 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.410
 so it's easier when it comes to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.270
 do sports and do not hit us 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.860
 or that entangles anything red not 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.780
 We are doing bicycle or whatever 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.940
 we have gone out to the street to perform 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.210
 a test of both the audio quality 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.610
 as the comfort of headphones 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.350
 As you can see, it was quite airy and this is not 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.710
 has caused the headphones to 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.570
 bring are we are completely in 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.490
 sports sessions like running or 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.380
 neither do they fall because the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.480
 grip and firmness to our ear is 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.190
 great in terms of audio quality 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.160
 we have to say that they are 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.410
 headphones of medium-high range and that by 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.110
 both are expected to sound very good and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.510
 So it is a delight to do sports 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.370
 or walk with these headphones do not have 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.190
 noise cancellation so if you do 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.140
 a lot of air or gives us in profile yes that we 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.740
 we will give a kind of turbulence in 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.900
 the ears 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.120
 the price of these headphones in Amazon 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.700
 usually around 150 euros 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.180
 although they can be found on offer from 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.040
 usual way for about 120 euros as 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.110
 summary of the headphones we have to 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.319
 say that we like them and we recommend them 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.269
 its sporty and modern design the quality 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.850
 of audio that they offer along with their genius 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.799
