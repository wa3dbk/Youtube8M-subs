table the edge of the table and right

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
table the edge of the table and right
here<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> dorsal<00:01:05.850> fin<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> cut

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.179 
here are the dorsal fin I'm going to cut
in<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> skin<00:01:07.439> tends<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> little

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
in because the skin tends to be a little

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
in because the skin tends to be a little
thinner<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.000> whatever<00:01:09.180> reason<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
thinner there for whatever reason so I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
thinner there for whatever reason so I
make<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> nice<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.130> cut<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.900> now

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
other side very similar to the haddock

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.749 
other side very similar to the haddock
and<00:04:42.620> I'm<00:04:42.710> going<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.860> separate<00:04:43.249> that<00:04:43.310> caller

and I'm going to separate that caller
come<00:04:44.360> in<00:04:44.509> down<00:04:44.689> here<00:04:45.009> because<00:04:46.009> it's<00:04:46.219> flat<00:04:46.460> on

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
come in down here because it's flat on

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.249 
come in down here because it's flat on
the<00:04:46.699> table<00:04:47.060> it's<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.240> lot<00:04:47.419> easier<00:04:47.779> now<00:04:47.840> because

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
the table it's a lot easier now because

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.140 
the table it's a lot easier now because
it's<00:04:48.710> flat<00:04:48.919> on<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.129> table<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.610> do<00:04:49.669> that<00:04:49.789> same

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
it's flat on the table and do that same

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.700 
it's flat on the table and do that same
thing<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:50.629> want<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.900> make<00:04:51.110> sure<00:04:51.169> I'm<00:04:51.439> on<00:04:51.560> the
