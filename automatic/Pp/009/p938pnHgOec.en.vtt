00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
their new flagship I'm not exactly sure

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240 
their new flagship I'm not exactly sure
because<00:00:15.210> they've<00:00:15.450> been<00:00:15.570> dropping<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.560> names

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
because they've been dropping the names

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
because they've been dropping the names
a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.539> scent<00:00:18.990> p6<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.650> this

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
a lot there was a scent p6 of this

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.060 
a lot there was a scent p6 of this
unsent<00:00:20.340> p7<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.270> then<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> p8<00:00:22.500> which

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
unsent p7 and then this is p8 which

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.500 
unsent p7 and then this is p8 which
seems<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.640> following<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> trails<00:00:24.330> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
seems like it's following the trails of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120 
seems like it's following the trails of
the<00:00:24.600> assessor's<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.289> there's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.619> scent<00:00:25.859> mate

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the assessor's but there's a scent mate

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.099 
the assessor's but there's a scent mate
and<00:00:26.340> there's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> other<00:00:27.840> things

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and there's a lot of other things

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
and there's a lot of other things
happening<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:29.970> sure

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
happening there so I'm not really sure

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
happening there so I'm not really sure
which<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.480> factual<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.800> seems

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
which is factual or not but this seems

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
well and the design it seems like a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.380 
well and the design it seems like a

little bit of iPhone 6 and a little bit
of<00:03:31.760> experience<00:03:32.360> op<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.549> lot<00:03:34.820> of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
of experience op here it's a lot of

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.729 
of experience op here it's a lot of
mixtures<00:03:35.299> but<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> good<00:03:35.989> thing<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.350> Huawei

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
mixtures but the good thing is Huawei

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.970 
mixtures but the good thing is Huawei
has<00:03:37.120> made<00:03:38.120> their<00:03:38.360> logo<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> lot<00:03:39.290> smaller<00:03:39.680> than

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
has made their logo a lot smaller than

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.570 
has made their logo a lot smaller than
they<00:03:40.130> used<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.459> put<00:03:40.730> on<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.030> models<00:03:41.989> previous

they used to put on the models previous

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.830 
they used to put on the models previous
prior<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.820> this<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.570> very<00:03:44.750> good

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
prior to this so that's a very good

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.470 
prior to this so that's a very good
thing<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.500> overall<00:03:45.860> quality<00:03:46.070> sips<00:03:46.489> very<00:03:47.060> very

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
thing the overall quality sips very very

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.410 
thing the overall quality sips very very
good<00:03:47.660> overall<00:03:48.530> build<00:03:48.920> quality<00:03:49.010> seems<00:03:49.420> almost

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
good overall build quality seems almost

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.890 
good overall build quality seems almost
