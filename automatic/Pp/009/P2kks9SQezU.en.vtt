well mister you Rocky
yep<00:00:07.490> those<00:00:08.490> flywheels<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.809> numbers<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.320> them

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
yep those flywheels have numbers in them

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490 
yep those flywheels have numbers in them
if<00:00:11.130> they<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.519> why<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.110> put<00:00:13.349> those

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
if they do why have you put those

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.189 
if they do why have you put those
numbers<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.519> well<00:00:14.880> unfortunately<00:00:15.509> back

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
numbers in there well unfortunately back

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.220 
numbers in there well unfortunately back
when<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> ones<00:00:17.100> were<00:00:17.310> being<00:00:17.550> made<00:00:18.230> indian

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
when the ones were being made indian

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.710 
when the ones were being made indian
wasn't<00:00:19.680> consistent<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:21.150> deep<00:00:21.449> they

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
wasn't consistent on how deep they

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189 
wasn't consistent on how deep they
drilled<00:00:22.020> these<00:00:22.340> recesses<00:00:23.340> or<00:00:23.730> carnivores<00:00:24.480> for

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
drilled these recesses or carnivores for

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.429 
drilled these recesses or carnivores for
the<00:00:25.410> thrust<00:00:25.920> washers<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> very

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the thrust washers so it's very

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.529 
the thrust washers so it's very
important<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.130> these<00:00:29.330> connecting<00:00:30.330> rods

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
important to get these connecting rods

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.500 
important to get these connecting rods
in<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> middle<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.320> flightless<00:00:32.030> and<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
in the middle that are flightless and in

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
in the middle that are flightless and in
order<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.410> we've<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.690> from

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
order to do that we've got to know from

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.889 
order to do that we've got to know from
this<00:00:36.870> surface<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> flywheel<00:00:38.719> to<00:00:39.719> this

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
this surface of the flywheel to this

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
this surface of the flywheel to this
surface<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.770> from<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.160> surface<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.850> this

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
surface and from this surface to this

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.170 
surface and from this surface to this
surface<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:44.180> 636

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
surface and you can see this one 636

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
surface and you can see this one 636
this<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.110> 600

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this one 600

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.450 
this one 600
so<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.640> 36,000<00:00:48.629> fever<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.739> means<00:00:50.039> we've

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so that's 36,000 fever which means we've

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.150 
so that's 36,000 fever which means we've
got<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> put<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> washer<00:00:51.379> whatever<00:00:52.379> washers<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
got to put a washer whatever washers we

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
got to put a washer whatever washers we
choose<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.559> 35,000<00:00:55.559> thicker

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
choose this one has to be 35,000 thicker

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.689 
choose this one has to be 35,000 thicker
than<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.680> doesn't<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.430> whole

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
than this one now doesn't this whole

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
than this one now doesn't this whole
thing<00:01:00.090> depend<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:02.960> bushings<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.170> are<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
thing depend on the bushings that are in

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.870 
thing depend on the bushings that are in
the<00:01:06.710> connecting<00:01:07.710> rods<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> done

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the connecting rods what have you done

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.810 
the connecting rods what have you done
there<00:01:09.180> okay<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> boys<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.640> this<00:01:11.640> was

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
there okay the boys think this was

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.590 
there okay the boys think this was
fairly<00:01:12.119> easy

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
fairly easy

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.350 
fairly easy
they've<00:01:13.409> already<00:01:13.650> allowed<00:01:14.400> 10<00:01:14.729> thousandths

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
they've already allowed 10 thousandths

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
they've already allowed 10 thousandths
this<00:01:15.900> hopefully<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.530> opening<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this hopefully this opening in the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880 
this hopefully this opening in the
forging<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> ten<00:01:17.909> thousands<00:01:18.390> wider<00:01:18.659> than<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
forging is ten thousands wider than the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
forging is ten thousands wider than the
actual<00:01:20.430> inside<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.990> long<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.500> press

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
actual inside was as long as we press

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.880 
actual inside was as long as we press
these<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> inside<00:01:25.140> we've<00:01:25.619> got

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
these in even on the inside we've got

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.929 
these in even on the inside we've got
our<00:01:26.070> ten<00:01:26.310> thousand<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.860> that's<00:01:28.860> easy<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
our ten thousand and that's easy and you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.749 
our ten thousand and that's easy and you
did<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> yes<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.990> did<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.979> thank<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.520> for

goes in there with a little edge on it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.890 
goes in there with a little edge on it
which<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.509> sure<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900

and tell me about how you measured the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.870 
and tell me about how you measured the
diameter<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.580> those<00:01:47.910> bushings<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:50.220> diameter

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
diameter of those bushings the diameter

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.790 
diameter of those bushings the diameter
of<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:51.240> bushings<00:01:51.720> yeah<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.020> had<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.470> special

of these bushings yeah you had a special

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.230 
of these bushings yeah you had a special
tool<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.520> showed<00:01:53.790> me<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> moment<00:01:54.420> ago<00:01:54.630> oh<00:01:56.240> all

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
right actually I turned up I turned up a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.200 
right actually I turned up I turned up a
piece<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.670> steel<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.980> had<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> problem

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
piece of steel and I I had a problem

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.360 
piece of steel and I I had a problem
they<00:02:03.660> were<00:02:03.720> too<00:02:03.990> tired<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:04.350> press<00:02:04.560> fit<00:02:04.830> in<00:02:04.980> here

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
they were too tired to press fit in here

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.900 
they were too tired to press fit in here
and<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.330> actually<00:02:06.660> had<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.080> home<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
and so I actually had to home the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
and so I actually had to home the
connecting<00:02:08.910> rods<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.720> tiny<00:02:10.350> tiny<00:02:10.649> bit

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
connecting rods out just a tiny tiny bit

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400 
connecting rods out just a tiny tiny bit
they<00:02:11.610> got<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.820> 4<00:02:12.150> ton<00:02:12.510> press<00:02:12.870> bit<00:02:13.170> which<00:02:13.380> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
they got a 4 ton press bit which is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.550 
they got a 4 ton press bit which is
perfect<00:02:14.400> what<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.209> don't<00:02:15.840> want<00:02:16.110> an<00:02:16.260> 8<00:02:16.440> or

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
perfect what I want I don't want an 8 or

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.100 
perfect what I want I don't want an 8 or
10<00:02:16.800> conk<00:02:17.190> respite<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.570> puts<00:02:18.840> too<00:02:19.080> much

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
10 conk respite because it puts too much

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.000

no doubt the Indian motorcycle company
did<00:02:51.250> exactly<00:02:51.880> these<00:02:52.060> same<00:02:52.390> things<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:53.940> yes<00:02:54.940> I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
did exactly these same things I yes I

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.510 
did exactly these same things I yes I
would<00:02:56.380> hope<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:58.560> having<00:02:59.560> opened<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.310> lot

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
would hope so but having opened up a lot

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.060 
would hope so but having opened up a lot
of<00:03:00.550> motors<00:03:01.140> even<00:03:02.140> though<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.380> would<00:03:02.560> hope<00:03:02.710> so

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
of motors even though we would hope so

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.030 
of motors even though we would hope so
we<00:03:03.820> don't<00:03:04.030> actually<00:03:04.210> believe<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.290> do<00:03:05.620> we

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
we don't actually believe so do we

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.790 
we don't actually believe so do we
well<00:03:06.220> let<00:03:06.580> me<00:03:06.670> put<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.150> way<00:03:07.390> from<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.770> I

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
well let me put it this way from all I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.130 
well let me put it this way from all I
can<00:03:09.130> figure<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.880> I've<00:03:10.000> had<00:03:10.240> two<00:03:10.480> motorcycles

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
can figure and I've had two motorcycles

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.490 
can figure and I've had two motorcycles
fail<00:03:11.380> on<00:03:11.650> me<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:13.210> they<00:03:13.720> both<00:03:13.900> failed<00:03:14.260> at

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
fail on me and they both failed at

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.940 
fail on me and they both failed at
between<00:03:15.040> 2,000<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:15.940> 3,000<00:03:16.630> miles<00:03:16.840> plus<00:03:17.590> all

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
between 2,000 and 3,000 miles plus all

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.290 
between 2,000 and 3,000 miles plus all
the<00:03:18.100> speedometers<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.910> I've<00:03:19.030> collected

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
the speedometers that I've collected

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.110 
the speedometers that I've collected
over<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.750> years<00:03:19.990> from<00:03:20.260> one-on-ones<00:03:21.120> we're

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
over the years from one-on-ones we're

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.220 
over the years from one-on-ones we're
stuck<00:03:22.480> between<00:03:23.010> 2,000<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.070> 3,000<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.750> have

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
stuck between 2,000 and 3,000 so I have

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.960 
stuck between 2,000 and 3,000 so I have
to<00:03:26.410> come<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.920> opinion<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.580> most<00:03:27.730> of

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
to come to the opinion that most of

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.050 
to come to the opinion that most of
these<00:03:28.090> motors<00:03:28.570> lasted<00:03:29.110> only<00:03:29.670> between<00:03:30.670> two<00:03:30.790> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
these motors lasted only between two and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.600 
these motors lasted only between two and
three<00:03:31.150> thousand<00:03:31.750> miles<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:33.010> we're<00:03:33.430> building

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
three thousand miles now we're building

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.790 
three thousand miles now we're building
motors<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.450> one<00:03:34.630> he<00:03:34.750> has<00:03:34.840> nine<00:03:35.080> thousand<00:03:35.620> six

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
motors this one he has nine thousand six

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.740 
motors this one he has nine thousand six
hundred<00:03:36.040> nine<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> bottom<00:03:37.390> end<00:03:37.570> was

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
hundred nine and the bottom end was

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.840 
hundred nine and the bottom end was
beautiful<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:41.350> we<00:03:41.890> did<00:03:42.070> have<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> little<00:03:42.550> bit<00:03:42.730> of

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
beautiful so we did have a little bit of

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.190 
beautiful so we did have a little bit of
an<00:03:42.970> off-center<00:03:43.360> problem<00:03:43.840> which<00:03:43.990> we're

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
an off-center problem which we're

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.820 
an off-center problem which we're
correcting<00:03:44.680> but<00:03:44.920> other<00:03:45.460> than<00:03:45.730> that

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
correcting but other than that

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.980 
correcting but other than that
9600<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:48.070> think<00:03:48.970> we<00:03:49.120> can<00:03:49.270> build<00:03:49.420> twenty<00:03:49.810> five

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
9600 I think we can build twenty five

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.770 
9600 I think we can build twenty five
thousand<00:03:50.500> mile<00:03:50.680> bottom<00:03:51.100> ends<00:03:51.370> now<00:03:51.490> yeah

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
thousand mile bottom ends now yeah

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.199 
thousand mile bottom ends now yeah
except<00:03:52.780> one<00:03:53.020> other<00:03:53.230> problem<00:03:53.860> we<00:03:54.040> found<00:03:54.340> that

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
except one other problem we found that

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.949 
except one other problem we found that
was<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.990> acid<00:03:56.709> etching<00:03:57.120> we<00:03:58.120> do<00:03:58.270> have<00:03:58.450> acid

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
was that acid etching we do have acid

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.590 
was that acid etching we do have acid
etching<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.709> I<00:04:00.070> don't<00:04:00.280> know<00:04:00.610> Jeff's<00:04:01.240> going<00:04:01.480> to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
etching and I don't know Jeff's going to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
etching and I don't know Jeff's going to
try<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.840> solve<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:03.600> we<00:04:04.600> got<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.050> bearing

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
try to solve that we got a bearing

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.290 
try to solve that we got a bearing
engineer<00:04:06.100> over<00:04:06.400> here<00:04:06.580> from<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.880> touring

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
engineer over here from the touring

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.920 
engineer over here from the touring
company<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.900> he<00:04:08.709> knows<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.430> problem<00:04:09.940> all<00:04:10.510> too

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
company and he knows the problem all too

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.099 
company and he knows the problem all too
well<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:12.070> happens<00:04:12.520> even<00:04:12.670> on<00:04:12.940> new<00:04:13.180> cars<00:04:13.540> and

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.629 

it's<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.829> problem<00:04:18.069> yeah<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:19.299> chances<00:04:20.289> are<00:04:20.639> when

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
it's a problem yeah so chances are when

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.629 
it's a problem yeah so chances are when
we're<00:04:21.849> leaving<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.690> motorcycle<00:04:23.639> unattended

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
we're leaving the motorcycle unattended

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.540 
we're leaving the motorcycle unattended
for<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.300> couple<00:04:25.659> of<00:04:25.750> weeks<00:04:26.370> we're<00:04:27.370> going<00:04:27.460> to

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
for a couple of weeks we're going to

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.399 
for a couple of weeks we're going to
drain<00:04:27.819> the<00:04:28.000> oil<00:04:28.030> out<00:04:28.479> of<00:04:28.509> the<00:04:28.720> sump<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.169> get

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
drain the oil out of the sump and get

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.330 
drain the oil out of the sump and get
any<00:04:29.590> acid<00:04:30.159> out<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:31.030> may<00:04:31.360> be<00:04:31.419> in<00:04:31.720> there<00:04:31.960> I

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
don't know if that's the answer I've

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.760 
don't know if that's the answer I've

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
acid etching is I don't know the Brinell

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.260 
acid etching is I don't know the Brinell
they<00:04:44.169> call<00:04:44.409> it<00:04:44.590> false<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.190> false<00:04:45.879> brinelling

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
they call it false and false brinelling

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.779 
they call it false and false brinelling

yeah<00:04:58.000> that's<00:04:58.449> dangerous<00:04:59.020> that'll<00:04:59.379> cause<00:04:59.620> the
