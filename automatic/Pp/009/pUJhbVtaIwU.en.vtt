00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.060

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.060
 eba 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.330

 in the distance 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.730

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.730
 I am no longer any 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.869
 walk 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.770
 the graph 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.880
 if I give clear 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.360
 this is to add that voter shot something 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.330
 who clarified that lowering a point of 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.810
 connection but they all take me like this or that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.280
 12 hours trancon matters if it were weapon 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 I would leave the game because 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.310
