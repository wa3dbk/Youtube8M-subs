all<00:00:02.100> right<00:00:02.310> so<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:03.920> large<00:00:04.920> six-foot<00:00:05.910> solar

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
all right so the large six-foot solar

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.020 
all right so the large six-foot solar
vacuum<00:00:07.379> tubes<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:08.280> arrived<00:00:08.700> they're

vacuum tubes have arrived they're

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.720 
vacuum tubes have arrived they're
working<00:00:09.450> extremely<00:00:09.809> well<00:00:10.559> I've<00:00:11.429> been<00:00:11.580> doing

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
working extremely well I've been doing

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.070 
working extremely well I've been doing
some<00:00:12.059> tests<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:13.759> they<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:14.969> even<00:00:15.660> heated

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
some tests here they have even heated

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.970 
some tests here they have even heated
the<00:00:16.199> water<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.859> tube<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:18.080> over<00:00:19.080> 200

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the water in this tube to over 200

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.700 
the water in this tube to over 200
degrees<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.020> steam<00:00:22.289> off<00:00:22.529> the

literally boiling the water which for
those<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:35.040> much<00:00:35.190> energy<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
those of you know how much energy that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.869 
those of you know how much energy that
takes<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:37.260> considerably<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.190> energy<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
takes is considerably more energy to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.209 
takes is considerably more energy to
change<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.360> state<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.840> water<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.739> steam

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
change the state from water into steam

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.170 
change the state from water into steam
vapor<00:00:41.540> than<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.960> energy<00:00:43.260> required<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> only

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
vapor than the energy required to only

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
vapor than the energy required to only
raise<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.750> energy<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.320> room<00:00:47.070> temperature

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
raise the energy from room temperature

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.119 
raise the energy from room temperature
up<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.960> well<00:00:48.960> over<00:00:48.989> 200<00:00:49.649> degrees<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
up to well over 200 degrees so this is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.819 
up to well over 200 degrees so this is
this<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> soaking<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.420> incredible<00:00:51.930> amount

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this is soaking up an incredible amount

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.209 
this is soaking up an incredible amount
of<00:00:53.039> energy<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:54.449> tubes<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:55.219> fantastic

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of energy so these tubes are fantastic

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
of energy so these tubes are fantastic

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a tube or a couple tubes and build a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.640 
a tube or a couple tubes and build a
really<00:01:19.799> simple<00:01:20.100> rack<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.080> put

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
really simple rack and you can just put

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
really simple rack and you can just put
these<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.520> Sun<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.939> any<00:01:24.060> experiments<00:01:24.570> but

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
these in the Sun for any experiments but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.320 
these in the Sun for any experiments but
you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.840> also<00:01:24.960> put<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.470> room<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
you can also put them in a room and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
you can also put them in a room and
they'll<00:01:27.330> soak<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.860> sunlight<00:01:29.400> during<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
they'll soak up the sunlight during the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.530 
they'll soak up the sunlight during the
day<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> keep<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> room<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> much<00:01:33.210> cooler

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
day and keep the room that much cooler

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.630 
day and keep the room that much cooler
and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.140> slowly<00:01:34.799> release<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> energy

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and then slowly release the energy

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.480 
and then slowly release the energy
overnight<00:01:36.329> keeping<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> room

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
that much warmer and as you can see we

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.370 
that much warmer and as you can see we
soaked<00:01:40.340> up<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.610> ton<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:40.850> energy<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.290> is

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
soaked up a ton of energy so this is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.889 
soaked up a ton of energy so this is
just<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.710> thing<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.130> can<00:01:43.640> do
