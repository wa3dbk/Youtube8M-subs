first<00:00:21.000> off<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.330> got<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> FAMAS<00:00:23.000> sleight<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
first off we got the FAMAS sleight of

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.259 
first off we got the FAMAS sleight of
hand<00:00:24.300> that's<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.689> basically<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.849> kill

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
hand that's just basically the kill

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.800 
hand that's just basically the kill
whoring<00:00:27.720> class<00:00:28.050> that's<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.970> kill<00:00:29.970> anyone

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
whoring class that's just kill anyone

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
whoring class that's just kill anyone
it's<00:00:31.650> dominate<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> class<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.000> don't

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
it's dominate with that class I don't

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's dominate with that class I don't
use<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.840> much<00:00:33.989> anymore<00:00:34.140> because<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.250> use

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
use it that much anymore because I use

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.440 
use it that much anymore because I use
ACR<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.079> lightweight<00:00:37.770> UMP<00:00:38.700> normally<00:00:39.180> for

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
ACR and lightweight UMP normally for

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.819 
ACR and lightweight UMP normally for
after<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> flag<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> demo<00:00:41.090> this<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.390> have

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
after the flag and demo this I have

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.459 
after the flag and demo this I have
you'll<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.460> mostly<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.840> three

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you'll see I use mostly all like three

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
you'll see I use mostly all like three
or<00:00:46.590> four<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:46.920> guns<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.969> like

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
or four different guns and I have like

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
or four different guns and I have like
two<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> three<00:00:48.780> different<00:00:49.289> classes<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.070> each

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
two to three different classes for each

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.660 
two to three different classes for each
gun<00:00:50.629> because<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:52.559> no<00:00:52.770> point<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> making

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
gun because there's no point of making

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
gun because there's no point of making
like<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> p90<00:00:54.690> class<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.289> never<00:00:55.440> gonna

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
like a p90 class when we're never gonna

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580 
like a p90 class when we're never gonna
use<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.020> only<00:00:58.050> differences

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
use it so I just the only differences

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.000 
use it so I just the only differences
marathon<00:00:59.160> she's<00:01:00.090> marathon<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.020> SMD<00:01:01.500> normally

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
marathon she's marathon for SMD normally

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
marathon she's marathon for SMD normally
or<00:01:02.250> run<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> spot<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.780> quick<00:01:04.049> switch<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
or run to a spot then quick switch to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.359 
or run to a spot then quick switch to
this<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.909> gone<00:01:06.090> people<00:01:06.330> easier<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
this so I can have gone people easier I

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.320 
this so I can have gone people easier I
don't<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.549> use<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> 16<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:09.810> much

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
don't really use them a 16 very much

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.270 
don't really use them a 16 very much
yeah<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.840> use<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
yeah I don't really use it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.450 
yeah I don't really use it
UMP<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.450> sometimes<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.259> CTF<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.040> small

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
UMP I use this sometimes in CTF on small

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.830 
UMP I use this sometimes in CTF on small
maps<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.299> need<00:01:18.509> lightweight<00:01:18.930> or

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
maps when you don't need lightweight or

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.660 
maps when you don't need lightweight or
demolition<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.409> I'm<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.740> instead<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
demolition when I'm just instead of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.960 
demolition when I'm just instead of
using<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> ACR<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:26.040> sleight<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> hand<00:01:26.610> class

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
using the ACR this sleight of hand class

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
using the ACR this sleight of hand class
I<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.439> very<00:01:28.740> much<00:01:28.860> either<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I don't use this very much either but I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
I don't use this very much either but I
would<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.030> demolition<00:01:30.840> sometimes<00:01:31.380> it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
would for like demolition sometimes it's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.789 
would for like demolition sometimes it's
better<00:01:32.640> than<00:01:32.900> marathon<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.290> scope<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
better than marathon if you can scope in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.690 
better than marathon if you can scope in
faster<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.729> helps<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.340> main

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
faster that really helps this is my main

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
faster that really helps this is my main
capture<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> flag<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.049> 95

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
capture the flag I use it like 95

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.420 
capture the flag I use it like 95
percent<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:42.350> marathon<00:01:43.350> UMP<00:01:44.070> but

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
percent of the time or marathon UMP but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
percent of the time or marathon UMP but
this<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> my<00:01:45.329> main<00:01:45.570> class<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.380> still<00:01:46.770> have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
this is my main class I can still have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
this is my main class I can still have
gun<00:01:47.159> people<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> I'm<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.570> good

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
gun people with this I'm really good

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
gun people with this I'm really good
with<00:01:48.899> light<00:01:49.350> weight<00:01:50.299> I'm<00:01:51.299> some<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.770> flag

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
with light weight I'm some the flag

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.959 
with light weight I'm some the flag

runner on my team so I know where to run
I'm<00:01:57.600> pretty<00:01:57.960> smart<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.860> know<00:01:59.219> how<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I'm pretty smart out I know how this

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.990 
I'm pretty smart out I know how this
game<00:02:00.420> works<00:02:00.979> same<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:02.700> smoke

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
game works same thing so with smoke

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.889 
game works same thing so with smoke
grenades<00:02:04.070> sometimes<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.219> smoke<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.450> grab<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
grenades sometimes I smoke then grab the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.059 
grenades sometimes I smoke then grab the
flag<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.350> run<00:02:07.590> through<00:02:07.890> my<00:02:08.039> smoke<00:02:10.069> ACR

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
flag then run through my smoke ACR

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.580 
flag then run through my smoke ACR
that's<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.610> basically<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
that's just basically like the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.960 
that's just basically like the
my<00:02:12.950> first<00:02:13.220> class<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:14.150> killing<00:02:14.690> everyone<00:02:15.970> Nolan

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
my first class is killing everyone Nolan
