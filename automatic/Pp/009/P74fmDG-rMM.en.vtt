00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.020 

get<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.530> large<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:41.030> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
get this large it up a little bit and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
get this large it up a little bit and
say<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:42.600> mess<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.190> see

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
say our mess with it into you can't see

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
say our mess with it into you can't see
most<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> heaven<00:00:45.120> screen<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.540> can<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
most of heaven screen you can just see a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160 
most of heaven screen you can just see a
little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.739> blade<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.750> put<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
little bit of a blade and then put that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.350 
little bit of a blade and then put that
little<00:00:50.100> over<00:00:50.840> halfway<00:00:52.550> make<00:00:53.550> sure<00:00:53.580> it's<00:00:53.940> even

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.930 

and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.540> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.870> actually<00:00:58.470> start<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.949> next

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and then you can actually start it next

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.560 
and then you can actually start it next
I'd<00:01:00.180> suggest<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> put<00:01:01.229> the<00:01:01.440> rake<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.570> because

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I'd suggest to put the rake in because

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
I'd suggest to put the rake in because
then<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.739> judgment<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.580> how<00:01:06.360> big

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
then you can judgment of how big

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
then you can judgment of how big
everything<00:01:06.810> else<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.770> by<00:01:08.250> these

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
everything else is going to be by these

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.490 
everything else is going to be by these
two<00:01:09.210> things

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.070 

oh<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.920> want<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.430> barely<00:01:17.240> touching<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
oh you want this barely touching the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.710 
oh you want this barely touching the
corner<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:21.220> little<00:01:22.220> box<00:01:22.430> here<00:01:22.670> just<00:01:23.540> made

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
corner of that little box here just made

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.480 
corner of that little box here just made
this<00:01:23.900> same<00:01:24.260> color<00:01:24.620> is<00:01:24.860> that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.139 

and<00:01:31.090> then<00:01:31.329> you're<00:01:31.570> going<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.840> need<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.350> get

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
and then you're going to need to get

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:40.080 
and then you're going to need to get
rectangle<00:01:34.149> thin<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:38.490> change<00:01:39.490> color<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.939> this

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
rectangle thin and change color of this

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.690 
rectangle thin and change color of this
so<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:40.509> get<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.320> right<00:01:41.530> size<00:01:41.830> make<00:01:42.670> sure

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
so you can get the right size make sure

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.190 
so you can get the right size make sure
it's<00:01:43.030> even

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:04.310 

then<00:01:50.799> turned<00:01:51.219> it<00:01:51.340> down<00:01:51.430> there

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.880 

now<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> need<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:07.140> lieutenant

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
now you're going to need a lieutenant

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.550 
now you're going to need a lieutenant
simple<00:02:10.220> shape<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
simple shape that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
simple shape that
mansoura<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.129> can't<00:02:14.400> see<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> inside<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
mansoura you can't see it inside the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.080 
mansoura you can't see it inside the
circle<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.750> circle<00:02:19.019> covers<00:02:19.709> they<00:02:20.090> might

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
circle and the circle covers they might

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970 
circle and the circle covers they might
need<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.480> change<00:02:21.510> direct<00:02:22.170> time<00:02:22.349> both<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.799> to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
need to change direct time both in to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.330 
need to change direct time both in to
fit<00:02:23.220> into<00:02:23.989> like<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.709> then<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
fit into like that and then get a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.090 
fit into like that and then get a
regular<00:02:29.849> circle

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:46.800 

shrink<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.880> down<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.330> fit<00:02:38.540> inside<00:02:38.660> there

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.550 

you're<00:02:47.349> going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.560> need<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.950> rectangle<00:02:48.610> thins

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.650 

same<00:02:56.220> size<00:02:56.550> as<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.849> other<00:02:57.120> ones

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.140 

get<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.500> barely<00:03:01.040> touching<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.520> bottom<00:03:01.820> one

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
get it so barely touching the bottom one

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.440 
get it so barely touching the bottom one
and<00:03:02.390> at<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.990> very<00:03:03.020> edge<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.860> box<00:03:04.070> so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
and at the very edge of the box so

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.700 
and at the very edge of the box so
you'll<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.750> block<00:03:06.080> anything<00:03:06.410> out

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
you'll have to block anything out

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.990 
you'll have to block anything out
because<00:03:06.920> I'm<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.250> enough<00:03:07.460> room<00:03:07.670> flat

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
because I'm going to be enough room flat

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.480 
because I'm going to be enough room flat
and<00:03:08.270> just<00:03:08.510> copy<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.990> line<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.200> push<00:03:09.590> X<00:03:10.160> to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
and just copy that line just push X to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.880 
and just copy that line just push X to
duplicate<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.300> put<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.080> over<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.710> looks

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
duplicate it and put it over so it looks

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.430 
duplicate it and put it over so it looks
spaced<00:03:13.280> about<00:03:13.490> right<00:03:16.780> but<00:03:17.780> all<00:03:17.960> right<00:03:18.140> there

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
the center large in a little bit so I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.750 
the center large in a little bit so I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.640 

go<00:03:48.760> down<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.209> back<00:03:51.780> get<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.959> small<00:03:53.319> leaf<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
go down and back get the small leaf and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.750 
go down and back get the small leaf and
go<00:03:56.650> ahead<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.800> put<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.040> underneath<00:03:57.430> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
go ahead and put that underneath the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.570 
go ahead and put that underneath the
lieutenant<00:03:58.270> so<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.480> can't<00:03:58.840> see<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.550> stem<00:04:00.550> of

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
lieutenant so you can't see the stem of

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.949 
lieutenant so you can't see the stem of
the<00:04:00.730> leaf<00:04:02.550> put<00:04:03.550> them<00:04:03.849> in<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.450> put<00:04:04.690> them<00:04:04.810> any

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
the leaf put them in you put them any

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.259 
the leaf put them in you put them any
way<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.170> want<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.800> put<00:04:06.700> these<00:04:06.880> through<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
way you want I put these through the

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.750 
way you want I put these through the
same<00:04:07.540> ordinary<00:04:08.380> way<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:10.420> third<00:04:10.690> one<00:04:10.989> I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
same ordinary way and the third one I

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.820 
same ordinary way and the third one I
flip<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.900> looks<00:04:14.110> like<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.440> goes<00:04:14.620> with

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
flip it so it looks like it goes with

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.659 
flip it so it looks like it goes with
the<00:04:15.010> other<00:04:15.190> ones<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:20.500> then<00:04:20.650> last<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:21.489> not

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
the other ones and then last but not

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.129 
the other ones and then last but not
least<00:04:21.729> you're<00:04:22.240> going<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.510> need<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:23.460> squared<00:04:24.460> up

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
least you're going to need a squared up

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.620 
least you're going to need a squared up
so<00:04:26.139> you<00:04:26.200> can't<00:04:26.500> see<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> little<00:04:26.950> black<00:04:27.220> line<00:04:27.630> put

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
so you can't see a little black line put

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.659 
so you can't see a little black line put
that<00:04:28.810> behind<00:04:28.990> everything<00:04:29.820> changed<00:04:30.820> black

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
that behind everything changed black

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.090 
that behind everything changed black
larger<00:04:33.669> net<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.960> there<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.260> be<00:04:35.470> there's<00:04:35.950> a

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
larger net and there you be there's a

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.780 
larger net and there you be there's a
habitat<00:04:36.639> symbol<00:04:38.040> this<00:04:39.040> video<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.520> probably

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
habitat symbol this video is probably

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.120 
habitat symbol this video is probably
not<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:39.940> greatest<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.570> world<00:04:40.660> but<00:04:41.260> hey
