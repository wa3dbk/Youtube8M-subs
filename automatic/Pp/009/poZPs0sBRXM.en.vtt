 born in alger tindouf in algeria he added 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.229
 start thinking 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:10.779
 then went through 'the echoes' time 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.290
 you do not go there on italy 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.539
 I made a mistake in Spanish 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.949
 francis I returned to belgium cancer liechtenstein where the year 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.900
 past it went very well 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.590
 then if continuity with the European company and then again 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.590
 we were seen subject to re-signing too much blood 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.720
 a kitchen garden colmar 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.420
 we'll talk a little about basketball because I saw a little 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.390
 football 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.079
 with time seems logical that this period without can really get it 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.890
 it's cold and rainy 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.040
 in addition everyone in the neighborhood I do not care so I had the impression 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.270
 that it's difficult to make a hole 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.950
 basketball hoop it's inside 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.970
 I was fast my athletic qualities chelsea michel from my 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.700
 younger age of which I was a little faster than everyone whose 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 I had facilities 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.430
 for young people a friend 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.890
 I always have my a minor and nemo formally 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.100
 julien rey 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.259
 if I feel 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.330
 at but do you have a basketball school 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.850
 we saw young people coming out of there that's this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 professional 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 little first who was professional so 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.040
 but bob menama 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.230
 things like that 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.430
 he also had the same thing a little charleroi 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 with god to whom things like that 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.550
 but how to say at that point they started to woo him a little 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 little health then that with the social and maybe happen I had 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.970
 16 17 years old at the time 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.350
 then I had defeated his vices that came on foot takes some elected officials who 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.150
 had organized a draft day 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.430
 and a little 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.430
 and his look or in this it he invited so young 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.760
 to come because this day 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.920
 alas yin 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.660
 but I hit in the body 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.850
 and then there I already could I already say that at that moment I do not 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.050
 did not know with the things that had told me that if 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.530
 what he wanted me to become 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 I knew I had a future in this sport 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.380
 this summer the first time I went to think about cork it was 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.359
 it was a big story at ski tv 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.079
 what happens to my contract 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.399
 to leave after the games because I was tired but several things 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.959
 I needed to have more things in common 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:21.630
 like that help 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.810
 and I felt the need to leave by 30 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.340
 the sound is one of the few formations people will have the same ones who have 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.679
 is uncomfortable and 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.849
 and I did not play basketball and I needed a ship needed to 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.849
 leave in the simca machined without any real counterpart 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.229
 gianni motti 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.829
 by after when I came back appetence do 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.799
 if you were not stopping over what it was before 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.029
 so it's a club that 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:48.219
 who said 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.219
 graffiti financial problems 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.379
 finally the outcome of this conflict that has almost no longer see them this moment 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.389
 given this chance 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.760
 to continue makarov say somewhere since it's been six months since 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.809
 I was without a club 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.019
 taking over pastors it was more like before 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.199
 Mass I felt at home again because it's a club I've 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.099
 known for five years that's where I started my career 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.169
 and then when I'm ironed allies after again 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.919
 after transfer of Roma 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.669
 maass been cited it's a bit normal considering the situation of cancer at this 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.479
 moment 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.229
 he understood who could not keep me com so that's clear to this 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.689
 that was a lot simpler for a lot of blood 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.689
 everyone's mind that I wear 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.309
 it must be seen there are several are several aspects of the derby at first 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.269
 supporters for whom 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.349
 the derby do not want the license can do all the games of the season but 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.090
 the derby for them it's super-important had no pardon a week before 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.709
 they only talk about that and live only from that 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.479
 he's like supporters 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.189
 it is in this case small attack 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.189
 good of asia it's a quiet day in the country it can be 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.049
 it's a dream of europe 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.569
 even if it's always friendly even 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.189
 so it starts to start already there with them 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.739
 the supporters 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.739
 then bah necessarily because the supporters 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.239
 it's a lesson for the whole year which are also we also want to 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.270
 make them happy so 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.910
 we still feel the importance of 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.139
 of the match when we approach the derby 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.780
 and it's true that it's always a very special atmosphere because the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.120
 room is always filled for last year 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.630
 it's often a good atmosphere 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.630
 so this season it's always very intense matches 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.800
 I think that the visibility of the basketball is not the same as that of the fouta 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.969
 the meeting starts from the standard which is still 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.969
 one of the leading teams of Belgian football with an elective mandate 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.690
 this is not the case of liÃ¨s even if last season we did a very beautiful 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.430
 season it's still constant 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.509
 and especially charleroi that remain 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.509
 the leading teams of the Belgian championship and even at the European level 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.159
 so it's gone not it's not comparable 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.240
 I admit that for the clae season we did last year 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.830
 we notice that by the mouz essays and I felt it feel when 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.819
 when I walk in life I felt that people 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.740
 all recognize and things like that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.000
 still not comparable 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.120
 because steve 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.120
 I want to have the standard footballers 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:21.789
 no but it's true that m 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.169
 go to reindeer case we are sporty and 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.879
 chacha chak athlete has an ego like that I must not be sure of 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.659
 have self-confidence to be able to express myself on the ground to make 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:34.490
 things 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.830
 author of beautiful things 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.539
 I think we live it's something important 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.530
 and a year 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.800
 and how to say 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.680
 having 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.999
 people let people who recognize you in the street and leave 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.969
 embarrassing her about even more confidence and that makes me want to 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.980
 work even more dense than you do that you 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.920
 simple recognition of all the work you do every day against 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.409
 know anyway 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.610
 anyone here 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.860
 what did you do well your job you give me thoroughly 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.979
 when you pass somewhere people recognize you all recognize 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.590
 recognize that what you do well 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.930
 7This motivates a bit to continue in this way and work even more 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.729
 that it does not feed a little and I think 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.270
 michel bourez who says more yes it's true I would like them to read more
