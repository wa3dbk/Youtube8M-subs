00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.010
 the internet it's a government book 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.160
 the influences of it 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.329
 unconscious behavior of visitors who are gone 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.380
 I came up with the idea for the book because 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.719
 customers to the past 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 we have done everything to make the competition as good as possible 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.399
 those they share that we investigate and the texts improved 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.619
 listen carefully to our customers 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.220
 Monday hard sales improve the number of transactions it 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.220
 power or yes that 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.070
 the competition of more user-friendly 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.240
 make it better 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.320
 how can that do now 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.640
 go look for the mouth 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.220
 scientific rheumatism research in the field of cognitive psychology 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.050
 social psychology 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 and what appears to be what the Richterslaan sales say good news 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.980
 and what do we actually know from the player investigating the graduation research 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.710
 about 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.040
 m 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.550
 the behavior of people 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.300
 unrest then they will tell the holes 6 themselves 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 say something very different than and when you start to govern 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.650
 and there some cars during the day can itself be surprising that for the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.579
 and that I came up with the idea to write it down 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:12.930
 to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.550
 practical tips 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.550
 that can be used in any competition 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.870
 to share because there is just as much as possible in the rest 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.619
 what then may not come to mind when you 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.500
 are working on your website 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 but what works very well 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 and there are cities others engineering employ sources writing techniques animals 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 those in the min 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.380
 get into the training that the communication advisor says to yourself 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.220
 I didn't turn out to work 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.430
 and play the writing instruction recipe you have 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.640
 in schools 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.480
 that makes absolutely unsuitable extra internet 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.710
 He said things like that to them 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.910
 I think it could be very interesting to 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.800
 for everyone who is working with peter van der sar to read that is the reason 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.680
 that I have a conversation
