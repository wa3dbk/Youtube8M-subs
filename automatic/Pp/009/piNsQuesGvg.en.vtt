00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.470
 do not 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.450
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.370
 another video more than 42 in this case 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.670
 I will teach an easter egg that makes 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.990
 direct reference to assassin's creed 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 that I'm going to teach in other videos that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.520
 they refer to easter eggs 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.890
 ases enrolled in 42 we can find 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.169
 many clues that make us think that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 watts dogs and asciz inscrip could be 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.850
 the exact same thing could be a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 parallel story could be perhaps a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.239
 history that in the future will reach 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 cross somehow and good this without 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.740
 doubt is one of the Easter wars that most 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 can get to impress on these 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.810
 possible theories first of all must be said 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 that are theories there is nothing signed at 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.080
 one hundred percent of that truth that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 something is going to happen that maybe in a 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.940
 future have absolutely nothing that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.290
 see finally before teaching the egg 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.400
 of Easter I want to warn you that this 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.070
 Easter egg is completely 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.780
 random it may take five minutes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.939
 half an hour an hour five hours ten 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 whatever it is to get to find it 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.200
 ok you do not know an exact form of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.509
 make it appear or that it originates or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.159
 simply that the console wants to load 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.670
 the event and appear some pasco 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.040
 so good in my case like 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.360
 to provide some information 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.080
 when I recorded this video I still did not have the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 100% of the juice had a 90 or 92 - like 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 I say it can simply be a detail 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.570
 but at least I confirm that no 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.820
 you need to have 100% to get to 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.039
 see it so nothing else if you're going to 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.560
 I wish you good luck because in 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.270
 reality it takes a lot of luck for 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.270
 get to find this easter egg 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.960
 which is to eat better I tell you that 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.960
 as best 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.680
 be promoted to that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.410
 how am I seeing on screen toni for 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.460
 see with a name completely 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.040
 random that does not have any 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.900
 relevance is a former employee of 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.149
 abstergo of course who has played 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.890
 in the saga of assassin's creed will sound 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.180
 which is the company of abstergo but good 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.670
 to do some blessings that are the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.840
 bad assassin's creed is worth it because if 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.520
 we start telling the story of 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.440
 asteroids mostly from assassin's 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.060
 creed would give for enough videos 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.100
 then good as it has already been seen in 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.170
 other videos is renamed once 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.660
 more in this easter egg to the company 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.010
 of abstergo as for example in 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.440
 the saga of having registered 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.209
 specifically in the last one that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.570
 named bloom which is the company 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.640
 let's say bad in this case of watts dogs 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.190
 so good you have to give as I said 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.380
 is a reference more to assassin's creed 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.150
 as I say it is not very clear if this is 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.500
 a parallel story if they are going to cross 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.570
 in a moment to stories like that 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.970
 index or silent because it is a wink that 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.200
 are doing between let's say the two 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.420
 videogames but good you have to give 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.070
 old employee of abstergo there is another 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.840
 video we have to end a 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.130
 pretty important person of abstergo 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.770
 I recommend seeing it if you have not 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.840
 seen so nothing else here is another 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.060
 Easter egg more in what's dogs that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.500
 it referred to assassin's creed no 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.730
 you miss the other videos that I'm 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.560
 going up to the channel and I hope that I have 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.400
 liked this so nothing but a greeting 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.400
 and see you
