00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.420
 gamescom 2014 we are here at the booth of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 astragon and look at us now 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.280
 Agricultural simulator 15 on 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.260
 What's new in the matter of what? 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.869
 the last version so come on 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.150
 completely new is the part forestry 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.070
 that means you can in the new version 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
 also fell trees 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.830
 on the one hand by hand with the chainsaw 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.149
 or with such a big harvester where 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 you can keep the trees small and then 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.410
 transport and sell 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.790
 that is so the big new feature 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.059
 In addition, we have the graphics engine 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.649
 overworked that we have some new ones 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.020
 Graphic effects and details to the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.700
 machines that look more realistic and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 In addition, we have the physics engine 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 completely rebuilt that that too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.649
 driving behavior and the weight of the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 better to carry machine is ok and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.320
 There is also a new map which is exactly 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.000
 this for a new map and what is there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.430
 maybe what was not there yet 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.880
 other maps yes that's one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.799
 Scandinavian maps is such a bit 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 north european was the idea 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.180
 Stop that for this one 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.100
 lumberjack part of big counter or or 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.640
 fir forests needs and that one 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.290
 a bit yes that gives the feeling and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.000
 accordingly, the card is pretty 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 of course that has continued wooded 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.479
 also a lot of fields all the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 Agriculture certainly will not work 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.030
 short 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.670
 but in addition you have a lot of forest 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.440
 and to operate the forestry 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.180
 means there are also a whole lot new 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.700
 Vehicles come to it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.490
 what are those exactly for vehicles next to 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.460
 the forestry vehicles so yes to everyone 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.350
 case we have over 100 new vehicles 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.119
 and machines back in the game 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.030
 Of course, everything you need 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.659
 So different brands of from 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.780
 tractors group approach new 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.790
 Harvester 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.020
 yes then as said the forestry things 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.310
 Of course, everyone is new there, you need them 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.380
 a shredder and a back cart etc 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.960
 yes basically easy in all 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.060
 saved where we where 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.130
 where we need something to agriculture 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 We also have new equipment to operate 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.360
 new vehicle and the big brands 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.320
 the new ones have come to the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.240
 dutch as a tractor brand and tank 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.810
 It is a big brand in the area 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.120
 forestry ok and you say it 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 just the physics engine has been completed 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.510
 modified changed means that the mods 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.710
 can not be used anymore 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.550
 or created completely new 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.110
 Need to become 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.660
 they do not have to be completely rebuilt 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.750
 fortunately so will the physics 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.310
 engine is completely changed the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.220
 construction of the mods is still 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.720
 but what does this mean for the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.980
 engine changes is that certain values â€‹â€‹new 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.140
 have to be adjusted 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.390
 but that is a relatively small thing there 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.610
 Do it more or less with one 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.110
 must be able to control texteditor 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.150
 just try a little bit on the new one 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.330
 Physics like that but that works 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.670
 cost a mod for everything 15 suitable too 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.750
 who should have trained in the ls 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 be relatively low 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.470
 but you have to do something else so the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.600
 physics function is not exactly the same 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.090
 what about the graphic 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 news from what 's there and detail 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.880
 news for example we have one 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.140
 little 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.510
 stronger light effects the reflections 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.400
 in metal are stronger and then on glass 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.470
 we just have higher resolution 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.210
 In addition we have the textures 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.430
 feature the vehicles and devices 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.550
 So everybody gets dirty with it 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 works which are then dirty it 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.820
 pretty good off when the dirt is 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.110
 you can spread on the device 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.470
 then wash off with a 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.000
 Karcher then we have tire marks 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.160
 built-in that also makes the game 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.940
 bit more interesting away from the field 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.100
 under goes yes left we still have 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.140
 this is not for gameplay 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.370
 necessarily relevant but in multiplayer 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.930
 is it still cool when people really 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.590
 can flash turn form a 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.900
 bit more realistic to play ok and 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.550
 Finally, the start menu has that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100
 yes, a lot changed what it was there 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.430
 the idea may be new 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.870
 minister or that will be in scope 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.030
 this is actually the reason for the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.100
 previous version does not get much 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.450
 this was just the design 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.140
 overworked that a bit now 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.840
 fresh a bit angular like us 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.560
 It does a good job too 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.140
 simply because very reduced 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.810
 design ok thanks so that's it 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.770
 here from the farm simulator 15 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.770
 here at astragon
