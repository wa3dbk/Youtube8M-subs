00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
them for about six weeks and then it

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.840 
them for about six weeks and then it
will<00:00:54.579> be<00:00:54.730> ready<00:00:54.969> so<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:57.280> just<00:00:57.460> want<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.699> look

for flowers they're just pretty obvious

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.439 
for flowers they're just pretty obvious
a<00:01:00.820> grow<00:01:01.149> up<00:01:01.300> on<00:01:01.539> they're<00:01:02.109> usually<00:01:02.469> the<00:01:02.829> highest

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
a grow up on they're usually the highest

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.810 
a grow up on they're usually the highest
growing<00:01:04.449> thing<00:01:04.870> on<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.410> potato<00:01:05.800> plant<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.550> then

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
growing thing on a potato plant and then

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.990 
growing thing on a potato plant and then
you<00:01:07.060> can<00:01:07.720> start<00:01:07.990> harvesting<00:01:08.230> them<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:08.979> but<00:01:09.520> if

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
you can start harvesting them now but if

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.539 
you can start harvesting them now but if
I<00:01:10.180> were<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.360> I'll<00:01:10.750> leave<00:01:10.900> them<00:01:11.110> annexure<00:01:11.650> it

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
I were you I'll leave them annexure it

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.969 
I were you I'll leave them annexure it
wasn't<00:01:12.850> quite<00:01:12.939> six<00:01:13.270> weeks<00:01:13.509> it's<00:01:13.720> about<00:01:13.930> two<00:01:14.590> to

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
wasn't quite six weeks it's about two to

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.130 
wasn't quite six weeks it's about two to
four<00:01:15.159> weeks<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.270> they<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.600> just<00:01:16.780> get<00:01:16.960> even

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
four weeks so they can just get even

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.380 
four weeks so they can just get even
more<00:01:17.380> bigger<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:18.130> you'll<00:01:18.250> get<00:01:18.400> more<00:01:18.460> more<00:01:19.150> out

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
more bigger so you'll get more more out

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.510 
more bigger so you'll get more more out
of<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.770> you'll<00:01:20.979> be<00:01:21.159> able<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:23.619> potatoes
