is<00:02:45.480> doing<00:02:45.780> maybe<00:02:45.990> they're<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.470> come<00:02:46.620> in

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
is doing maybe they're going to come in

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.310 
is doing maybe they're going to come in
and<00:02:47.040> lower<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.640> prices<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.150> doubt<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.810> doubt

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
and lower the prices I doubt it I doubt

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.600 
and lower the prices I doubt it I doubt
it<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.770> think<00:02:49.980> they'll<00:02:50.130> probably<00:02:50.370> wait

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
it because I think they'll probably wait

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.940 
it because I think they'll probably wait
and<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.240> mean<00:02:51.780> they<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.350> lot<00:02:52.590> quite<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and see I mean they have a lot quite a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.790 
and see I mean they have a lot quite a
bit<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.220> time<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.570> between<00:02:54.750> October<00:02:55.290> 26

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.050 
bit of time you know between October 26
and<00:02:56.240> maybe<00:02:57.380> into<00:02:58.380> November<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.850> they<00:03:00.000> do

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and maybe into November that if they do

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
bite out of their sails then they may

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.310 
bite out of their sails then they may
