00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
reason i guess just the test mix

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.520 
reason i guess just the test mix
have<00:01:50.780> them<00:01:50.900> in<00:01:50.990> my<00:01:51.110> my<00:01:51.590> hand<00:01:51.830> oh<00:01:52.690> but<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:54.410> know

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
i'm thinking the next time I do one I'll

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.490 
i'm thinking the next time I do one I'll
go<00:01:58.970> without<00:01:59.270> using<00:01:59.510> any<00:01:59.690> fire<00:01:59.960> spells<00:02:00.290> because

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
go without using any fire spells because

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.780 
go without using any fire spells because
it<00:02:00.620> was<00:02:01.810> pretty<00:02:02.810> easy<00:02:03.020> using<00:02:03.620> fire<00:02:04.040> spells<00:02:04.490> i

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
it was pretty easy using fire spells i

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.120 
it was pretty easy using fire spells i
will<00:02:05.240> say<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.480> fire<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:06.950> pretty

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
will say that fire this is pretty

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.410 
will say that fire this is pretty
overpowered<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.760> know<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.880> lot<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.060> enemies

bellowing Dragon Quest ring so I was

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.850 
bellowing Dragon Quest ring so I was
doing<00:02:17.210> plus<00:02:17.420> fifty<00:02:17.750> percent<00:02:18.020> fire<00:02:18.260> damage<00:02:18.710> and

doing plus fifty percent fire damage and
my<00:02:19.430> hand<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:19.970> increasing<00:02:20.420> my<00:02:20.510> rent<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> was

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
my hand was increasing my rent and was

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.620 
my hand was increasing my rent and was
increasing<00:02:21.740> my<00:02:21.800> damage<00:02:22.070> even<00:02:22.160> more<00:02:22.630> it's

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
increasing my damage even more it's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.150 
increasing my damage even more it's
getting<00:02:23.900> added<00:02:24.050> like<00:02:24.140> 430<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.680> hit<00:02:24.890> with<00:02:25.010> great

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
getting added like 430 a hit with great

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.490 
getting added like 430 a hit with great
combustion<00:02:25.580> all<00:02:25.670> about<00:02:25.850> 471<00:02:26.450> even<00:02:26.750> more<00:02:26.959> and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
combustion all about 471 even more and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.620 
combustion all about 471 even more and
it's<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.550> really<00:02:28.610> overpowered<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.540> know

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
it's just really overpowered so you know

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's just really overpowered so you know
i<00:02:29.660> would<00:02:29.870> think<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.370> doing<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:31.610> just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
i would think that doing one just

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.100 
i would think that doing one just
strictly<00:02:32.120> using<00:02:32.390> melee<00:02:32.570> weapons<00:02:32.870> would<00:02:32.990> be<00:02:33.080> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
strictly using melee weapons would be a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.330 
strictly using melee weapons would be a
lot<00:02:33.320> more<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.770> would<00:02:33.890> be<00:02:34.010> even<00:02:34.100> more

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
lot more it would be even more

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.010 
lot more it would be even more
satisfying<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.150> be<00:02:35.209> even<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> tougher

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
satisfying and be even a tougher

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.260 
satisfying and be even a tougher
challenge<00:02:36.050> through<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.770> game<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.790> either

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
challenge through the game but either

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.090 
challenge through the game but either
way<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.750> was<00:02:38.870> really<00:02:39.140> fun<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:40.070> really

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
way it was really fun and I really

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.530 
way it was really fun and I really
enjoyed<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.940> will<00:02:41.150> probably<00:02:41.300> do<00:02:41.510> another

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
enjoyed it so I will probably do another

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.330 
enjoyed it so I will probably do another
one<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.110> might<00:02:42.320> record<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> next<00:02:42.980> one<00:02:43.220> as

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
one and I might record the next one as

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.260 
one and I might record the next one as
well<00:02:43.750> whether<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.930> will<00:02:45.080> be<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.610> note<00:02:46.610> pyromancy

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
well whether it will be a note pyromancy

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.729 
well whether it will be a note pyromancy
one<00:02:47.390> or<00:02:47.540> still<00:02:47.810> using<00:02:48.080> power<00:02:48.230> amenity<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.620> I

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
one or still using power amenity that I

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.979 
one or still using power amenity that I
don't<00:02:48.950> know<00:02:49.300> kind<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:50.480> depends<00:02:50.780> maybe

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
don't know kind of just depends maybe

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.390 
don't know kind of just depends maybe
i'll<00:02:51.110> use<00:02:51.260> less<00:02:51.530> pyro<00:02:51.800> man<00:02:51.980> sees<00:02:52.160> than<00:02:52.280> before

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
i'll use less pyro man sees than before

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.890 
i'll use less pyro man sees than before
maybe<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.820> only<00:02:53.000> keep<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.300> one<00:02:53.420> pyromancy

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
maybe I only keep on one pyromancy

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.050 
maybe I only keep on one pyromancy
instead<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.170> two<00:02:54.350> online<00:02:54.739> quick<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:56.030> my
