TV: H. H.

00:00:02.432 --> 00:00:02.744
BERT: [GROANING]

00:00:02.744 --> 00:00:06.220
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.360
TV: H.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.180
BERT: I was watching my
favorite program.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.110
Now, this H comes
on THE screen--

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.200
H, H, H. Let's see
if I can fix it.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.560
Maybe if I changed channels
that might help.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.762
TV:

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:18.410
H. [CLICK]

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.600

H. [CLICK]

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.700
TV: H.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.972
BERT: [GROANS]

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:22.260
Nyeh, no good.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.945
How am I going to fix
this stupid set?

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:27.180
ERNIE: Hi, Bert.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.680
BERT: Oh, hi.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.970
ERNIE: What are you watching?

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.510
BERT: Well, I was watching
my favorite program, "The

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.400
Wonderful World of Pigeons." And
now, all of a sudden, this

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.080
H comes on the screen.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.830
ERNIE: Oh, well, did you try
changing channels, Bert?

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.260
BERT: Oh, yeah.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.150
I tried changing channels.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.770
TV: H.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.932
BERT: It was coming just to the
best part, and all of a

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:41.730
sudden, it's H.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.110
ERNIE: Hey, let me fix
it for you, Bert.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.870
BERT: I don't know.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.040
It makes me so mad.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.310
ERNIE: I'll fix it.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.530
TV: H.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.950
ERNIE: I'll turn the
set off here.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190
Now, go back there and unplug
the set, would you, Bert?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.170
BERT: Why, you're going to--

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.950
ERNIE: Just unplug the set
because I want to fix it.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.590
BERT: OK.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.470
ERNIE: [HUMS]

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.140
BERT: There.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.890
ERNIE: Let me just
look in here.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.160
Aha.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.200
Oh.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.720
Here's your problem, Bert.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.510
Here's the problem.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.990
You had a hat in there, Bert.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.840
So you--

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.790
this is a hat, Bert.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.680
BERT: How did you do that?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.440
ERNIE: Look at that.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.960
Now, a "hat" is an
H word, Bert.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.310
And so that's where the H was
coming from, from the hat.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.150
BERT: How'd you, ha--
well, you can't--

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.520
ERNIE: Oh, look at here, Bert.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.730
You had a hammer
in there, Bert.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.400
"Hammer" is another
good H word.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.610
See the hammer, Bert?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.580
That's the whole problem.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.320
BERT: You can't reach in a
television set like that.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.510
How do you-- how--

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.440
ERNIE: Well, Bert.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.992
Look what you had there.

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:26.440
[HONKS]

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.780
ERNIE: See, you got a
horn in there, Bert.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.970
Horn, "horn" is an H word.
"Horn" is another

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.750
good H word, Bert.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.900
BERT: I don't understand this.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.190
ERNIE: Let's see, what
else is in here?

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.940
BERT: Ernie, what you're
doing you can't do.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.090
I'm--

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.650
ERNIE: Here.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.220
Looky here, Bert.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.895
Here's a house.

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:39.620
You had a house in
there, Bert.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.630
See the house?

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.530
Now, a "house" is a
good H word, Bert.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.110
BERT: I don't get it.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.030
ERNIE: That was your
problem, see.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.050
BERT: I don't get it.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.750
ERNIE: [HUMS]

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.180
BERT: Ernie, that's impossible,
what you're doing

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.760
in that TV with the
house and the--

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.045
ERNIE: Oh, look what
you had here.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.980
Here's a hamburger, Bert.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.230
"Hamburger" is one of my
favorite H words, Bert.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.840
BERT: Why not?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.730
Sure, hamburger.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.660
Why not a hot dog?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.030
Sure.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.510
ERNIE: Great hamburger, Bert.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.150
BERT: Anything, sure.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.896
ERNIE: [CHOMPING]

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:03.500
Hey, Bert.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.760
BERT: What?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.890
ERNIE: Why are you still
wearing a hat?

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.110
Come here.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.300
BERT: Why, I--

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.192
ERNIE: Take off the hat Bert.

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:10.229
Hat looks better
on me, anyhow.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.295
[HUMS]

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:13.350
OK, let's see.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.850
Wow!

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.110
BERT: This isn't happening.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.370
ERNIE: Bert, Bert, look what
I got in here, Bert.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.776
Oh, look at here, Bert.

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:20.920
Here's a hamster, Bert.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.900
You had a hamster
in there, Bert.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.350
See the hamster?

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.070
That's Henry the Hamster.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.370
And "hamster" is a good
H word, Bert.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.965
There's your whole problem.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:30.560
Now, the set's all fixed.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.310
So you want to plug it back
in, and I'll turn on, OK?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.230
BERT: I'll plug it in.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.650
But I don't believe this.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.230
I've never seen anything
like this.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.690
ERNIE: It'll work now.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.880
BERT: It's plugged in.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.190
ERNIE: I'll just turn it on.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.010
BERT: It's not happening.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.940
TV: [BUZZING]

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.870
I.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.590
BERT: Look at that.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.470
TV: I. I.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.950
ERNIE: Oh, Bert, I'm sorry.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.345
I thought I've had it fixed.

00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:50.780
TV: I.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.520
ERNIE: But instead of repeating
H's, now it's

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.670
repeating I. Oh, Bert,
let me fix it.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.285
BERT: Wait, wait, hold
it, hold it.

00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:57.956
ERNIE: What?

00:02:57.956 --> 00:02:59.240
BERT: I like it.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.700
TV: I.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.140
ERNIE: You like it?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.320
BERT: I love it.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.880
It's exciting.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.765
ERNIE: It's exciting, Bert?

00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:04.960
BERT: Yeah.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.073
ERNIE: Henry, let's
you and I leave.

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:06.249
TV:

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.470
I. BERT: Wow.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.750
Exciting is in the words.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.580
It's new.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.310
It's thrilling.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.350
It's unique.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.580
It's new television talent,
what we needed all along.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.055
BERT AND TV: I.
