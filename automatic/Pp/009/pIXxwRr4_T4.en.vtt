00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.580
 next we will know about the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.800
 tilapia a very wanted meat 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 for its fillet with few thorns and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.590
 excellent tilapia flavor is the name 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 generic with what is called a group 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 of fish of African origin that consists 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.580
 of several species some with interest 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.460
 economic belonging to the genre oreo 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.230
 chrome inhabit mostly in 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.610
 tropical regions where the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 favorable conditions for its 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.989
 reproduction and growth among 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.840
 Species highlight the child's tilapia 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.840
 oreochromis niloticus the blue tilapia 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.969
 oreochromis aureus and the tilapia of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.969
 mozambique oreochromis mozambique 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.210
 and his extraordinary qualities as 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.580
 accelerated growth tolerance to high 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.290
 population densities adaptation to 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.020
 captivity and a wide range of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.790
 food resistance diseases meat 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.280
 quality white and wide acceptance 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.619
 have aroused great commercial interest in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.660
 world agriculture are fish of 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.940
 warm waters that live so much in water 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:32.869
 sweet as salty and can even 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:35.190
 get used to little oxygenated waters and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.890
 tilapia has a single hole 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.080
 nasal on each side of the head that serves 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 simultaneously as input and output of 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.220
 the nasal cavity the body is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.720
 generally compressed and discoidal 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.640
 rarely elongated the mouth is protractile 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 generally wide, often ordered by 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.860
 thick lips the jaws present 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.860
 conical teeth and sometimes 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.860
 incisors 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.000
 for their locomotion they have even fins 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.490
 Odd the even fins make them 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.349
 pectorals and the windows 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.260
 odd are constituted by the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.970
 dorsal fins caudal and anal 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.700
 anterior part of the dorsal and anal fin 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.170
 It's short consists of several thorns and the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.569
 terminal part of soft radios 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.580
 arranging its dorsal fins in shape 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.040
 The crest of the caudal fin is round 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.019
 truncated and rarely cut as in all 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.390
 the fish this letter is useful for 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.519
 maintain the balance of the body 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.480
 during swimming and when jumping on the 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.880
 Water is a very fertile tilapia fish 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.430
 it can be played at an early age 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.739
 and in a very small size the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.040
 temperature for reproduction of this 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.650
 fish in the water should be 20 degrees to 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.410
 25 degrees centigrade his sexual maturity 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.930
 It is reached between 2 and 3 months 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.540
 but in subtropical waters the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.739
 temperature can vary between 20 and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.840
 the 23 degrees centigrade 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.760
 light influences reproduction on 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.110
 increasing or decreasing lighting 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 8 hours the difficulty 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:23.319
 and tilapia also has seven stages 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.219
 of embryonic development after the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.959
 Spawning is completing its fourth stage 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:31.209
 the oreochromis genus is classified as 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.489
 omnivore for presenting greater diversity 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.709
 in the foods that you eat varying 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.530
 from microscopic vegetation to 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.629
 unicellular algae and bacteria tending 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.099
 towards the consumption of zooplankton a 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.500
 characteristic of most of the 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.120
 tilapia is that in culture they accept 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.480
 easily supplied food 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.799
 artificially such as plants 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.989
 waste of fruits vegetables and 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.239
 vegetable oilseeds and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.250
 cereal based feed 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.989
 the tilapia is the food 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.290
 natural that develop in the water 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.050
 and whose protein content is 55% 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.330
 approximately dry weight 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.820
 for the optimal development of tilapia 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.980
 it is required that in the cultivation site 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.020
 the requirements are maintained 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.490
 environmental issues in the following 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.890
 values 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.070
 the optimal temperature ranges 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.660
 they range between 20 to 30 degrees centigrade 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.850
 can withstand lower temperatures than 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.650
 15 degrees centigrade if it decreases more 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.650
 the tilapia will not grow 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.970
 as regards dissolved oxygen in 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.419
 the water the tilapia is able to withstand 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.030
 low concentrations approximately one 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.550
 milligram per liter even in periods 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.190
 short is able to withstand much less 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.680
 but you have to keep in mind that between 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.590
 less oxygen the less tilapia is 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.410
 will feed therefore will not grow what 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.979
 ideal is that it remains between the 2 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.580
 and 3 milligrams per liter 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:11.699
 especially in low light the values 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.070
 optimal ph are between 7 and 8 can not 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.389
 tolerate values less than 5 but yes 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.550
 can resist alkaline values ​​of 11 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.979
 as for the turbidity that is the 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.560
 water transparency this must be 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.340
 keep between 30 centimeters of 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.699
 visibility 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.639
 the altitude ranges from 850 to 2,000 meters 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.040
 above sea level the radiation 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.020
 solar has a considerable influence on the 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.810
 process of photosynthesis of plants 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.900
 aquatics giving way to production 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.240
 primary which is the number of plants 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.240
 that are formed in a period of time
