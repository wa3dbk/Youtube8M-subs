00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
about those waves because you will you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.539 
about those waves because you will you
were<00:01:11.060> saying<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:11.420> 500<00:01:11.990> miles<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.829> our<00:01:12.859> u.s.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
were saying like 500 miles for our u.s.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.919 
were saying like 500 miles for our u.s.
audience<00:01:14.200> 800<00:01:15.200> kilometers<00:01:15.680> per<00:01:15.920> hour<00:01:15.950> for

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
audience 800 kilometers per hour for

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.539 
audience 800 kilometers per hour for
global<00:01:17.929> audience<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:18.590> mean<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.219> just

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
global audience I mean it just

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.149 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:20.329> strength<00:01:21.170> involved<00:01:21.679> in<00:01:22.009> that

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.520 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:22.670> say<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.119> comes<00:01:23.390> presumably<00:01:24.380> that

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.499 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:24.890> one<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.399> strongest<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.119> then<00:01:26.299> the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.209 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:26.719> that<00:01:26.990> follow<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.409> weaker<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.070> that

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.609 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:28.490> or<00:01:28.670> not<00:01:28.729> not<00:01:29.210> necessarily<00:01:30.079> if<00:01:30.469> you

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
correct or not not necessarily if you

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.219 
correct or not not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:30.920> in<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.100> Abunda<00:01:31.579> arch<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:32.229> tsunami

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
remember in the Abunda arch a tsunami

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.770 
remember in the Abunda arch a tsunami
the<00:01:33.499> initial<00:01:34.490> one<00:01:34.670> was<00:01:34.700> bad<00:01:35.119> enough<00:01:35.479> but<00:01:35.689> then

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.279 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:35.929> had<00:01:36.460> essentially<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.820> wave<00:01:38.149> 3<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.719> wave<00:01:38.899> 4

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
we had essentially a wave 3 and wave 4

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.039 
we had essentially a wave 3 and wave 4
which<00:01:39.530> were<00:01:39.679> actually<00:01:40.070> higher<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.999> worse<00:01:41.689> so

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
which were actually higher and worse so

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.669 
which were actually higher and worse so
the<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.009> damage<00:01:43.460> is<00:01:43.850> ongoing<00:01:44.240> right<00:01:44.960> now<00:01:44.990> but

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
the the damage is ongoing right now but

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.919 
the the damage is ongoing right now but
may<00:01:45.799> continue<00:01:45.979> over<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.700> next<00:01:46.789> several<00:01:47.420> hours

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
may continue over the next several hours

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.649 
may continue over the next several hours
because<00:01:48.289> we<00:01:49.280> talked<00:01:49.729> about<00:01:49.880> these<00:01:50.060> waves<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
because we talked about these waves that

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.599 
because we talked about these waves that
come<00:01:50.929> in<00:01:51.140> each<00:01:51.490> successively

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
come in each successively

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.059 
come in each successively
producing<00:01:53.270> damage<00:01:54.079> here<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.560> we'll<00:01:54.829> have<00:01:54.979> to

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
producing damage here so we'll have to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.980 
producing damage here so we'll have to
watch<00:01:55.219> that<00:01:55.520> closely<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.999> again<00:01:56.149> not<00:01:56.719> just

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
watch that closely and again not just

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.379 
watch that closely and again not just
Japan<00:01:57.139> but<00:01:57.469> we<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.789> regional<00:01:58.789> across<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
Japan but we have a regional across the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.709 
Japan but we have a regional across the
Pacific<00:01:59.840> now<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.200> tsunami<00:02:00.859> watch<00:02:01.429> in<00:02:01.939> effect

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
Pacific now a tsunami watch in effect

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.319 
Pacific now a tsunami watch in effect
and<00:02:02.960> as<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:03.229> watch<00:02:03.469> these<00:02:03.770> dramatic<00:02:03.979> pictures

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
and as you watch these dramatic pictures

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.760 
and as you watch these dramatic pictures
that<00:02:05.329> is<00:02:05.479> telling<00:02:05.749> me<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.049> since<00:02:06.619> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
that is telling me that since the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.279 
that is telling me that since the
tsunami<00:02:06.979> was<00:02:07.490> generated<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.539> has<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.019> hit

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
tsunami was generated and it has now hit

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.960 
tsunami was generated and it has now hit
Japan<00:02:09.769> we<00:02:10.280> were<00:02:10.369> talking<00:02:10.729> about<00:02:10.789> other

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
Japan we were talking about other

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.950 
Japan we were talking about other
countries<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.599> are<00:02:11.690> going<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.959> be<00:02:12.049> in<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
countries that are going to be in the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.080 
countries that are going to be in the
path<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.220> course<00:02:14.250> Japan<00:02:14.850> didn't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
path of it and of course Japan didn't

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.090 
path of it and of course Japan didn't
have<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.450> much<00:02:15.630> time<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.260> warn<00:02:16.500> their<00:02:16.740> folks

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
have that much time to warn their folks

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340 
have that much time to warn their folks
there<00:02:17.340> along<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.640> seashore<00:02:17.940> because<00:02:18.690> they

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
there along the seashore because they

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.950 
there along the seashore because they
