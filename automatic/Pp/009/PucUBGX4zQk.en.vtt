00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello all welcome to ney lines if 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.250
 you want to know how to make these nails with 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.450
 a cow print between this follow 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.910
 looking 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.119
 you will need a white enamel a 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.250
 black enamel velvet powder 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:31.010
 black a cardboard or similar surface 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.590
 a points tool a plate or 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.739
 similar surface and a brush 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.390
 makeup or something similar 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.410
 we start by applying the base polish 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.410
 White color 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.460
 if necessary we give a new layer already 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.280
 that in principle the fund has to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.470
 be well covered we prepare the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.930
 work surface laying on top 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.230
 of the dish the open powders and the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.480
 paperboard 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.180
 we put some black enamel in the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.339
 cardboard or similar surface and with a 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.680
 points tool preferably 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.530
 with a big head we are going to make some 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.960
 how many random spots give you the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.490
 way you want the spots to me 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.229
 they like them very good and pulling 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.290
 rounded like real cows 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.360
 but in any case make sure you put a 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.430
 good amount of enamel so that then 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.450
 stick the velvet well by reviewing 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.450
 the several times 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.840
 quickly before it starts to 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.030
 dry the black enamel we submerge the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.250
 finger in the powder making sure that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.790
 the entire surface came into contact with 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.790
 the velvet 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.520
 we remove the finger from the jar and we give it 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.580
 a few taps to the surface of the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.800
 nail to seat the velvet and act 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.870
 followed we remove the leftover lint 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.620
 with a brush simulating that we give 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.620
 brush strokes 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.620
