happens is every time you died there's a
delay<00:04:05.640> in<00:04:05.880> spawning<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.780> was<00:04:07.200> thinking<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
delay in spawning so I was thinking I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.290 
delay in spawning so I was thinking I
was<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.800> how<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.280> get<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.760> know<00:04:08.850> at

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
was like how can I get this you know at

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.670 
was like how can I get this you know at
first<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.600> was<00:04:09.690> thinking<00:04:09.720> well<00:04:10.170> maybe<00:04:10.200> if<00:04:10.560> we

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
first I was thinking well maybe if we

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.070 
first I was thinking well maybe if we
put<00:04:10.860> some<00:04:11.330> what<00:04:12.330> do<00:04:12.390> they<00:04:12.510> call<00:04:12.720> pressure

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
put some what do they call pressure

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.720 
put some what do they call pressure
plates<00:04:13.380> around<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.920> bed<00:04:14.100> every<00:04:14.430> time<00:04:14.610> they

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
plates around the bed every time they

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.539 
plates around the bed every time they
line<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.870> redstone<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.799> know<00:04:16.950> around<00:04:17.430> here

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
line of redstone you know around here

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.640 
line of redstone you know around here
will<00:04:17.850> push<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.299> some<00:04:18.480> blocks<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.380> certain

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
will push up some blocks in a certain

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.349 
will push up some blocks in a certain
amount<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.919> time<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.669> they're<00:04:20.850> allowed<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> go

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
amount of time so they're allowed to go

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.840 
amount of time so they're allowed to go
back<00:04:21.510> down<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.770> actually<00:04:23.370> did<00:04:23.550> not<00:04:23.669> work

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
back down and that actually did not work

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.980 
back down and that actually did not work
so<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.060> was<00:04:24.120> thinking<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.479> know<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.630> was<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.870> oh

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
so I was thinking you know I was like oh

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.080 
so I was thinking you know I was like oh
you<00:04:25.080> know<00:04:25.290> what<00:04:25.410> cobwebs<00:04:25.889> will<00:04:26.070> work<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.490> every

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
you know what cobwebs will work so every

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.430 
you know what cobwebs will work so every
time<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.419> die<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.110> go<00:04:28.200> through<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
time you die you have to go through the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.960 
time you die you have to go through the
cobwebs<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.100> takes<00:04:29.310> about<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.850> couple

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
cobwebs and it takes about a couple

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.969 
cobwebs and it takes about a couple
seconds<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.840> know<00:04:30.930> two<00:04:30.990> three<00:04:31.350> seconds<00:04:31.830> and

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
seconds you know two three seconds and

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.159 
seconds you know two three seconds and
that's<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.060> that's<00:04:33.510> like<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.870> delay<00:04:34.139> of

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
that's the that's like the delay of

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.050 
that's the that's like the delay of
respawning<00:04:34.860> pretty<00:04:35.130> much<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.580> what<00:04:35.880> you're

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.190 
respawning pretty much and what you're
not<00:04:36.180> you're<00:04:36.360> not<00:04:36.389> supposed<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.810> be<00:04:36.960> hitting

people when you're actually in the
cobwebs<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.760> gotta<00:04:38.940> wait<00:04:39.120> till<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.389> actually

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690

here<00:04:46.229> so<00:04:46.350> I'm<00:04:46.440> gonna<00:04:46.530> break<00:04:46.950> that<00:04:47.130> one<00:04:47.360> window

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
here so I'm gonna break that one window

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.600 
here so I'm gonna break that one window
jump<00:04:48.570> back<00:04:48.720> down<00:04:48.840> here<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:50.190> teams<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.490> have

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
jump back down here and the teams I have

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.360 
jump back down here and the teams I have
coordinated<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.270> green<00:04:51.630> red<00:04:52.380> blue<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.100> yellow

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
coordinated is green red blue and yellow

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.770 
coordinated is green red blue and yellow
they're<00:04:53.760> all<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.000> same<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.390> know<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:54.690> you

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
they're all the same you know and you

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.300 
they're all the same you know and you
have<00:04:54.900> some<00:04:55.110> nice<00:04:55.260> terrain<00:04:55.650> going<00:04:55.950> around<00:04:56.130> here

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
have some nice terrain going around here

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.800 
have some nice terrain going around here
just<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.640> make<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:56.910> level<00:04:57.150> more<00:04:57.300> difficult<00:04:57.690> I

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
just to make the level more difficult I

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.930 
just to make the level more difficult I
personally<00:04:58.260> think<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.950> level<00:04:59.310> was<00:04:59.490> made<00:04:59.669> too

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
personally think this level was made too

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.029 
personally think this level was made too
small<00:05:00.270> but<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.600> still<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.169> really<00:05:01.770> really

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
small but it still is really really

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.400 
small but it still is really really
really<00:05:02.250> fun<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.870> guys<00:05:03.990> could<00:05:04.200> do<00:05:04.289> the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
really fun and you guys could do the

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.840 
really fun and you guys could do the
design<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.860> whatever<00:05:04.979> you<00:05:05.220> want<00:05:05.490> again<00:05:05.700> just

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
know what she because would be a good

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.370 
know what she because would be a good
idea<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.539> making<00:05:27.539> some<00:05:27.690> videos<00:05:27.960> on<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.260> as

through it get the sheep's with leads
hook<00:05:38.820> them<00:05:38.940> up<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.300> fences<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.810> guys

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
hook them up to the fences you guys

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.730 
hook them up to the fences you guys
could<00:05:40.110> do<00:05:40.200> all<00:05:40.350> this

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
put you put um glowstone around it so

put you put um glowstone around it so
you<00:06:18.190> get<00:06:18.430> close<00:06:18.640> done<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:19.060> like<00:06:19.270> line<00:06:19.510> it<00:06:19.540> up

you get close done you like line it up

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.600 
you get close done you like line it up
like<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.140> next<00:06:20.380> to<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:20.650> and<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:21.250> ice<00:06:21.370> block

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610

like that next to it and the ice block
will<00:06:21.760> be<00:06:21.790> right<00:06:22.030> here<00:06:22.240> but<00:06:22.390> you<00:06:22.480> do<00:06:22.570> it<00:06:22.690> on<00:06:22.840> all

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
sides and eventually it'll turn into

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.580 
sides and eventually it'll turn into
like<00:06:24.700> a<00:06:24.730> little<00:06:24.940> water<00:06:25.270> block<00:06:25.570> like<00:06:25.780> that<00:06:25.810> but
