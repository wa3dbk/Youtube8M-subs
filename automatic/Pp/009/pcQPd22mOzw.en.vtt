00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
just because the iOS iOS app is so slow

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.810 
just because the iOS iOS app is so slow

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.340 

this<00:05:38.990> also<00:05:39.230> takes<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.650> while<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:39.830> load

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.890 

there<00:05:44.980> we<00:05:45.100> go<00:05:45.550> there's<00:05:46.000> opera<00:05:46.330> mini<00:05:46.480> load<00:05:46.750> it

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
there we go there's opera mini load it

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.840 
there we go there's opera mini load it
up

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.890 

there's<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.920> QWERTY<00:05:55.920> keyboard<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:57.750> is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
there's the QWERTY keyboard that is

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:13.820 
there's the QWERTY keyboard that is
extremely<00:05:58.290> laggy<00:06:04.370> anyway

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.110 

I'm<00:06:14.790> also<00:06:15.060> UC<00:06:15.600> browser<00:06:16.460> which<00:06:17.460> I<00:06:17.610> personally

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
I'm also UC browser which I personally

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.900 
I'm also UC browser which I personally
prefer<00:06:18.450> over<00:06:18.720> Opera<00:06:19.590> Mini<00:06:19.740> but<00:06:20.130> that's<00:06:20.340> my

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
prefer over Opera Mini but that's my

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.030 
prefer over Opera Mini but that's my
opinion

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.930 

so<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.130> Opera<00:06:26.340> Mini<00:06:26.460> 8.7<00:06:28.430> does<00:06:29.430> not<00:06:29.580> give<00:06:29.820> you

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
so the Opera Mini 8.7 does not give you

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.640 
so the Opera Mini 8.7 does not give you
a<00:06:30.000> full<00:06:30.330> QWERTY<00:06:30.510> keyboard<00:06:30.990> you<00:06:31.110> have<00:06:31.230> to<00:06:31.350> input

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
a full QWERTY keyboard you have to input

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.680 
a full QWERTY keyboard you have to input
text<00:06:31.860> like<00:06:32.400> this<00:06:32.640> just<00:06:33.030> like<00:06:33.150> you<00:06:33.210> would<00:06:33.330> on

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
text like this just like you would on

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:44.540 
text like this just like you would on
the<00:06:33.720> default<00:06:34.650> browser

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.640

and who know of course which comes on

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.279 
and who know of course which comes on
