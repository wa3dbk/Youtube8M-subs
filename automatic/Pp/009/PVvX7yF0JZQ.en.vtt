00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.500
 those two on the doves fps server was 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.050
 so long we can neither fps 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.480
 at least an hour and a half on you point 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.370
 you know how much we like counter strike 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.529
 especially in the bus version e 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.570
 because in the global have done some 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.439
 bullshits 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 let's say they did a couple of things 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.660
 however this game remains good 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.930
 that we're going to review from 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 emblematic title neo tokyo hong io 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.340
 tokyo who knows i don't know the cars that is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.620
 a particularly large relief on the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.110
 face said fo kingston and nine neo 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.899
 tokyo guys is actually a mod 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 it is a fashion of half life a fashion that is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.170
 born ten years ago in 2004 just like 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 developer modules have started 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 implement it to get to one 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 final version only in the usa 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.050
 in the last period we say so too 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.239
 because in the last period what is it 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.239
 success has happened that this game is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.969
 been released as cold ply stand 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.309
 exact halo a stand alone that therefore 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.070
 it is a fashion but not too much a motorcycle 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.520
 obviously half life 2 so that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 runs on source exactly like 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.259
 many other titles of this kind 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 especially fps but let's see 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 what it is actually about is that yes 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.430
 redo much to the ghost saga in the shell 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.280
 and who knows this this to naimo 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.900
 anime or how the fuck you want to call it sa 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.960
 well what are we talking about 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.479
 yes exactly you know the manga 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.360
 that you know well and could not do 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.460
 unless you notice that there are some 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.640
 monstrous similarities between macs 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.110
 see here in the game in the setting 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.409
 in the way architecture is 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.360
 composed therefore we believe it is a 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.700
 very strong inspiration of taste 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.210
 on stage but then actually you go to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.170
 play something very different from dal 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.420
 futuristic 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.070
 mental ghosting of the ghost in the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 shell and above all the film of these 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.950
 choices you go to play snakes yes and no 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.140
 only if team deathmatches also go into 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.160
 reality the game modes are alone 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.050
 two poor, however, in the steal mode 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.069
 flag there is good that you do not steal 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.560
 a flag stolen a half-length 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.400
 metallic is called ghost and that vi 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.970
 speaks 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.489
 yes stolen I'm so both magos will talk to you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.900
 in Japanese all the time 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.880
 preventing precisely from hearing from 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.010
 which side your enemy is coming from 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.100
 and to hold in your arms 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.810
 this half chatty robot you 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.120
 you will have to drop the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 your main weapon which means that 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.330
 you know practically targets if yes 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.940
 were it not for thermal camouflage 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.410
 would mostly bold and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.350
 you would also be with camouflage 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.040
 thermal indeed because having in hand 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.850
 Talking something everyone knows the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.650
 your position 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.630
 exact because the purpose of the enemy is 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.600
 that of preventing you from carrying 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.519
 this so-called ghost even to say 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.310
 your team will have the task instead 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.799
 to support me while escorting this 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.350
 precious chattering object towards the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.970
 goal but in all the hours we have 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.040
 spent on the neo tokyo ours 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.380
 team how many times we listened to it 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.840
 during this operation not even half 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.160
 not even in the distance does it actually find in the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.530
 game is told to you 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.730
 specifically use the voip for 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.799
 coordinating them doesn't need the voip because 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.390
 if you know exactly where yours is 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.880
 mate you can safely go to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.519
 escort him but everyone seems to interpret 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.500
 this steals the ghost like that much is 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.450
 Then there are the servers too 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.640
 death match where I think these people 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.859
 try to escort because it's the only one 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.420
 really the community has taken it badly 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.760
 this game because maybe there are few 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.299
 mode and they like time I know well 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.870
 anyway 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.420
 she's a shooter 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.670
 as a counter strike source therefore a 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.670
 many dynamics and fire mode 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.470
 etc that draws a lot of counter strike if 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.140
 were it not that this time they have us 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.870
 put the exact pointing a pointing 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.480
 to the tail that in the ass to their mothers 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.519
 It can not be absolutely anto 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.590
 plateau what it means means that 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.470
 you click the sheet that a 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.470
 jeopardize and you have to recycle though 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.850
 there is no plus two is im 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.979
 absolutely sees entering the files of 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.840
 configuration and bandage a button that vi 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.389
 let's do this thing here and it's not 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.240
 for all effects you have to follow one 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.150
 Gui said so in short , neither so nor so 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.770
 they are too nice we come to the points 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.660
 pivot of this game 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.370
 you have the opportunity to camouflage them 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.370
 we said you have the possibility of 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.240
 jump like a rabbit gets excited 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.139
 surprising 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.430
 not in the sense that they are 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.050
 surprisingly others o 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.580
 surprisingly powerful they are 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.430
 surprising because when you jump you don't know 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.530
 never as tonight sometimes you jump to get me 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.240
 but sometimes you make 7 so you can't 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.729
 predict this thing are done a little 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.940
 which has a little so he surprised well in 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.830
 actually there is the usual bar underneath 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.020
 sense 3 liquid bars should us 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.150
 do a little eye to understand 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.700
 at the beginning you can make maximum two jumps 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.680
 long that will take you half kind 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.150
 everyone finger 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.099
 ok better in waiting for it 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.620
 recharge to make long jumps 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.180
 otherwise you will have to do short jumps e 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.060
 in fact long on some occasions yes 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.320
 they reveal really really useful but 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.570
 you never know how it ends 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.210
 exact because if you were to jump 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.039
 I know something like that with the barraca 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.229
 sorry revenue remains on the wall 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.849
 really guys and this is us 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.970
 we found it a bit annoying 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.919
 we have to tell the truth is to say that 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.560
 graphically the title despite rounds 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.599
 on a rather dated engine it does its own 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.400
 slutty figure but practically like everyone 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.710
 the titles that we run on source is not 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.979
 ugly to see we remember that yes 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.599
 turn also turns titan for so it's one 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.220
 version of its enamel much modification 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.690
 polarity and from a fort 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.280
 have not been much to change the 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.680
 engine however different 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.720
 the eye on canvas is a game that 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.340
 we advise you to download because it is 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.650
 free the community 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.420
 the Russians are already playing with it 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.490
 in the stable node the lost Russians 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.710
 very civil during matches and civilians 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.260
 and cooperatives exactly as they were 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.660
 jailers think so in there 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.400
 calls for water bread miss so disabled 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.780
 just serve as a target 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.550
 then and they do the practices 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.980
 but we are always on top of the servers 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.740
 look at this thing a little more 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.770
 nice we found on neo tokyo is 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.930
 the variety of maps are practically 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.730
 infinite also because the community that 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.630
 is working on the source graphics engine 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.250
 it has been given to do 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.930
 in practice the whole community now is 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.420
 we know how to use all sources anyway 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.020
 both the maps are many ways 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.540
 they are few but we must say that 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.250
 maps are not even and only in appearance 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.050
 the maps are very varied is that how 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.120
 level design so they will know you 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.370
 build lots of different situations 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.100
 now if the game cost 10 euros vi 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.820
 we will say that perhaps we should think about it 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.820
 on but it's free
