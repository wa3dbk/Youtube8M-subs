00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.729 
does not have the glass cupboard on top
of<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.670> either<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.989> open<00:00:37.350> at<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> top

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
of it either so it's open at the top

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.970 
of it either so it's open at the top
lots<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.340> ventilation<00:00:39.200> it's<00:00:40.200> been<00:00:40.469> split<00:00:40.829> into

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
lots of ventilation it's been split into

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.819 
lots of ventilation it's been split into
two<00:00:41.250> sections<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.809> hamsters<00:00:43.350> cannot

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
two sections because my hamsters cannot

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.130 
two sections because my hamsters cannot
get<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.340> each<00:00:44.370> other<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:45.329> keep<00:00:45.539> fighting

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
get on with each other we keep fighting

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
get on with each other we keep fighting
so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.980> been<00:00:47.250> separated<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> middle

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so it's been separated in the middle

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.860 
so it's been separated in the middle
with<00:00:48.899> some<00:00:49.200> plywood<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.270> i'm<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> show

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
with some plywood and i'm going to show

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
with some plywood and i'm going to show

their little houses okay so i'll start

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.189 
their little houses okay so i'll start
with<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.840> site<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> kiwi<00:01:02.309> side

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
with this site here which is kiwi side

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.770 
with this site here which is kiwi side
over<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> top<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.799> his<00:01:05.580> habitat<00:01:06.119> he<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:06.540> have

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
over the top of his habitat he does have

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
over the top of his habitat he does have
a<00:01:06.810> nice<00:01:07.049> little<00:01:07.290> saying<00:01:07.619> beware<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.400> dwarf

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
a nice little saying beware of the dwarf

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429 
a nice little saying beware of the dwarf
hamster<00:01:09.240> which<00:01:09.810> i<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.290> appropriate

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
hamster which i think is appropriate

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.070 
hamster which i think is appropriate
because<00:01:11.189> he's<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> troublemaker

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
because he's more of the troublemaker

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.340 
because he's more of the troublemaker
than<00:01:13.350> sparky<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.390> his<00:01:15.720> side<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
than sparky is this is his side of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
than sparky is this is his side of the
habitat<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.310> has<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:21.180> levels<00:01:21.450> in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
habitat and it kind of has two levels in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.980 
habitat and it kind of has two levels in
a<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.189> underneath<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.689> another

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a way underneath this there is another

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
a way underneath this there is another
world<00:01:26.000> it's<00:01:27.000> been<00:01:27.479> built<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.680> sawdust

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
world it's been built up with sawdust

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370 
world it's been built up with sawdust
because<00:01:29.729> underneath<00:01:30.180> there's<00:01:30.630> lots<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
because underneath there's lots of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
because underneath there's lots of
tunnels<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.369> I've<00:01:32.549> drawn<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:32.939> picture

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
tunnels and I've drawn a little picture

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.719 
tunnels and I've drawn a little picture
here<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:34.259> exactly<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> underneath<00:01:35.369> they've

here what exactly is underneath they've

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.289 
here what exactly is underneath they've
got<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.240> sorry<00:01:36.900> he's<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.710> box<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> den<00:01:38.970> and

and I've basically made him a little

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
and I've basically made him a little
underground<00:01:47.310> tunneling<00:01:47.939> system<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.869> has<00:01:49.020> his

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290

at<00:01:51.360> home<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.310> these<00:01:53.310> tunnels<00:01:53.990> are<00:01:54.990> all

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
at home and these tunnels are all

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.340 
at home and these tunnels are all
underneath<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.189> wood<00:01:56.460> shavings<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.200> can
