in<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:06.150> section<00:00:06.390> we're<00:00:06.660> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> cover<00:00:07.020> two

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
in this section we're going to cover two

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.680 
in this section we're going to cover two
elements<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.010> setting<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.550> suspension<00:00:08.940> ride

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
elements in setting a suspension ride

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.339 
elements in setting a suspension ride
height<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.110> rake<00:00:10.790> ride<00:00:11.790> height<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.349> really

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
height and rake ride height is really

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.140 
height and rake ride height is really
important<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.830> cars<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.940> lot<00:00:15.120> of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
important on cars that have a lot of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.359 
important on cars that have a lot of
aerodynamic<00:00:15.719> force<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.289> under<00:00:16.830> wings<00:00:17.010> like<00:00:17.220> an

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
aerodynamic force or under wings like an

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
aerodynamic force or under wings like an
IndyCar<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.300> still<00:00:18.510> important<00:00:18.840> in

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
IndyCar and it's still important in

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.939 
IndyCar and it's still important in
sports<00:00:19.199> cars<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.680> they're<00:00:19.830> getting

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
sports cars because they're getting

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
sports cars because they're getting
quite<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> bit<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.550> flow<00:00:20.730> under<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> car<00:00:21.240> but

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
quite a bit of flow under the car but

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
quite a bit of flow under the car but
the<00:00:22.080> ride<00:00:22.260> height<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.369> distance<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the ride height is the distance from the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.420 
the ride height is the distance from the
ground<00:00:24.240> plane<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> bottom<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> car

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
ground plane to the bottom of the car

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.040 
ground plane to the bottom of the car
usually<00:00:27.090> measured<00:00:27.390> at<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.539> front<00:00:27.779> axle

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
usually measured at the front axle

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.870 
usually measured at the front axle
number<00:00:28.349> axle<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.429> difference<00:00:29.820> between

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
number axle and the difference between

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.020 
number axle and the difference between
the<00:00:30.240> two<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:31.019> call<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> rake<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.820> rake

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the two we call the rake and the rake

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.060 
the two we call the rake and the rake
can<00:00:33.450> change<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.260> aerodynamic<00:00:34.739> behavior<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
can change the aerodynamic behavior of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.410 
can change the aerodynamic behavior of
the<00:00:35.160> car<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.579> high<00:00:35.700> speed<00:00:35.969> handling<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the car the high speed handling of the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750 
the car the high speed handling of the
car<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.380> key<00:00:37.649> parameter<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.430> tuning

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
car so it's a key parameter for tuning

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.330 
car so it's a key parameter for tuning
any<00:00:38.910> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> car<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> right

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
any kind of car really to get the right

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.610 
any kind of car really to get the right
balance<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.850> high<00:00:41.940> speed<00:00:42.469> naturally<00:00:43.469> you'd

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
balance at high speed naturally you'd

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.549 
balance at high speed naturally you'd
like<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> run<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> car<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.640> low<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.420> possible

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
like to run the car as low as possible

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.979 
like to run the car as low as possible
but<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.250> other<00:00:47.430> considerations

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
but there are some other considerations

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.029 
but there are some other considerations
for<00:00:48.989> sure<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> car<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.920> low

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
for sure you want the car to be as low

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.819 
for sure you want the car to be as low
as<00:00:50.160> possible<00:00:50.300> but<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> lower<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.469> street

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
as possible but if you lower a street

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
as possible but if you lower a street
car<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.340> until<00:00:53.640> hits<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> ground<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
car down until hits the ground now the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
car down until hits the ground now the
suspension<00:00:55.230> geometry<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.760> all

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
suspension geometry is going to be all

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
suspension geometry is going to be all
out<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> its<00:00:57.329> happy<00:00:57.690> operating<00:00:58.289> range<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
out of its happy operating range and so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
out of its happy operating range and so
now<00:00:59.039> you've<00:00:59.190> created<00:00:59.340> more<00:00:59.609> problems<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
now you've created more problems so you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.510 
now you've created more problems so you
want<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> car<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.440> low<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.710> possible<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
want the car as low as possible but you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.030 
want the car as low as possible but you
also<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.199> system<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> suspension<00:01:04.890> be

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
also want the system and suspension be

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.700 
also want the system and suspension be
designed<00:01:05.400> around<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.060> low<00:01:06.299> ride<00:01:06.510> height<00:01:06.720> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
designed around that low ride height so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
designed around that low ride height so
for<00:01:08.280> sure<00:01:08.400> you'd<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> car<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.270> just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
for sure you'd like the car to be just

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.210 
for sure you'd like the car to be just
touching<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> ground<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> highest<00:01:11.010> speed

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
touching the ground at the highest speed

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.620 
touching the ground at the highest speed
of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> highest<00:01:11.909> loading<00:01:12.180> condition<00:01:12.510> on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of the highest loading condition on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.620 
of the highest loading condition on
track<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.580> not<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.970> dragging<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.540> ground

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
track and not be dragging on the ground

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
track and not be dragging on the ground
because<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.110> it'll<00:01:16.350> slow<00:01:16.530> down<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.100> try

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
because now it'll slow down so you try

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.469 
because now it'll slow down so you try
and<00:01:17.460> lower<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> car<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and lower the car as much as you can

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
and lower the car as much as you can
before<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> hit<00:01:19.380> given

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
before it's going to hit given

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.230 
before it's going to hit given
everything<00:01:20.159> else<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.610> you're<00:01:20.759> tuning<00:01:21.150> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
everything else that you're tuning in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
everything else that you're tuning in
the<00:01:21.330> car<00:01:21.680> ride<00:01:22.680> height<00:01:22.920> adjustment<00:01:23.520> also

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the car ride height adjustment also

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
the car ride height adjustment also
allows<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> change<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.930> rake<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
allows you to change the rake with a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
allows you to change the rake with a
card<00:01:26.280> angle<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> attack

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
card angle of attack

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.950 
card angle of attack
well<00:01:28.140> rake<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.670> said<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> difference<00:01:30.869> in

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
well rake as I said is the difference in

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.030 
well rake as I said is the difference in
the<00:01:31.049> front<00:01:31.229> rear<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:31.560> height<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the front rear right height and so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
the front rear right height and so
positive<00:01:33.030> rake<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> rear<00:01:34.020> higher

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
positive rake would be the rear higher

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.780 
positive rake would be the rear higher
than<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> front<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.250> might<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> do

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
than the front and you might want to do

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.149 
than the front and you might want to do
that<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> want<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> move<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.710> center<00:01:37.950> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that if you want to move the center of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
that if you want to move the center of

aerodynamic<00:01:40.200> forces<00:01:40.560> forward<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.909> reduce

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
aerodynamic forces forward to reduce

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
aerodynamic forces forward to reduce
understeer<00:01:42.479> because<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.680> more

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
understeer because that would put more

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.170 
understeer because that would put more
pressure<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> front<00:01:44.579> tires<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> reduce

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
pressure on the front tires and reduce

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.810 
pressure on the front tires and reduce
high<00:01:45.509> speed<00:01:45.750> understeer<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.430> want<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
high speed understeer or if you want the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.219 
high speed understeer or if you want the
other<00:01:47.939> way<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.149> might<00:01:48.240> put<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> negative<00:01:48.840> rake

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
other way you might put a negative rake

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.480 
other way you might put a negative rake
where<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> rear<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.770> lower<00:01:50.009> than<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> front

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
where the rear is lower than the front

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.969 
where the rear is lower than the front
so<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.110> dynamic<00:01:52.560> force<00:01:52.799> on

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
so that you put more dynamic force on

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.560 
so that you put more dynamic force on
the<00:01:53.070> rear<00:01:53.189> tires<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.579> cure<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.119> maybe<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the rear tires and cure it maybe a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
the rear tires and cure it maybe a
high-speed<00:01:55.079> oversteer<00:01:55.470> condition<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.610> using

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
high-speed oversteer condition so using

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.209 
high-speed oversteer condition so using
the<00:01:57.240> rake<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.869> tune<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.409> aerodynamic<00:01:58.890> balance

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the rake to tune the aerodynamic balance

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.889 
the rake to tune the aerodynamic balance
of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.399> car<00:01:59.579> by<00:01:59.909> moving<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.420> center<00:02:00.570> pressure

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
of the car by moving the center pressure

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.440 
of the car by moving the center pressure
forward<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.590> rearward<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.000> same<00:02:03.180> time

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
forward or rearward but at the same time

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
forward or rearward but at the same time
brake<00:02:03.750> might<00:02:03.960> affect<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> suspension

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
brake might affect the suspension

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
brake might affect the suspension
geometry<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.240> simple<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.689> need

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
geometry so it's not so simple you need

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.320 
geometry so it's not so simple you need
to<00:02:06.869> think<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.069> doing<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.429> your

aerodynamics<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:14.030> weight<00:02:14.900> jacker<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:16.180> tool

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
aerodynamics a weight jacker is a tool

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.640 
aerodynamics a weight jacker is a tool
we<00:02:17.420> use<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:18.290> adjust<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.310> right<00:02:20.180> rear<00:02:20.650> corner

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
we use to adjust the right rear corner

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.410 
we use to adjust the right rear corner
weight<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.250> right<00:02:22.550> eye<00:02:22.580> down<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.060> Indy<00:02:23.210> cars

the<00:02:23.900> weight<00:02:24.050> jacker<00:02:24.290> basically<00:02:24.740> gets<00:02:24.920> taller

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
the weight jacker basically gets taller

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.120 
the weight jacker basically gets taller
and<00:02:25.580> shorter<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.180> thereby<00:02:26.800> cranks<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
and shorter and thereby cranks up the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.010 
and shorter and thereby cranks up the
height<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.880> load<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.600> right<00:02:29.750> rear

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
diagonal with more weight jacker the car

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.860 
diagonal with more weight jacker the car
will<00:02:43.160> tend<00:02:43.340> oversteer<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.570> put<00:02:44.750> more

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
will tend oversteer and if you put more

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.840 
will tend oversteer and if you put more
take<00:02:45.410> away<00:02:45.560> off<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> right<00:02:46.310> rear<00:02:46.550> left

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
take away off of the right rear left

take away off of the right rear left
front<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.270> other<00:02:47.390> words<00:02:47.570> put<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.080> other

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
front in other words put it on the other

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.320 
front in other words put it on the other
corner<00:02:48.410> that'll<00:02:48.920> start<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> understeer<00:02:49.760> so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
corner that'll start to understeer so

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.380 
corner that'll start to understeer so
you<00:02:50.720> basically<00:02:50.900> shift<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.950> weight

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
you basically shift the weight

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.430 
you basically shift the weight
dynamically<00:02:53.390> with<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> weight<00:02:53.810> jacker<00:02:54.080> on
