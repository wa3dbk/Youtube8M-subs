00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.100
 same way 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.960
 Apple owners chase new worms 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.570
 since autumn 2013 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.490
 and we doubtful ports rejoice with 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.650
 incomprehensible control fortunately 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.480
 game developers began to realize that 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.000
 the android market is much broader about it 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.190
 I shouldn’t forget 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.280
 lover of the series as a whole is very pleased that 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.120
 such a game settle down on a tablet so oh 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.270
 than me 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.670
 which worms finally yes all the same channel 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.559
 filed represents the video review of the game 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.870
 worms 3 what is the connection you ask third 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.809
 parts worms on mobile series in general 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.000
 no poking you is not a port like you 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.399
 able to understand from the entry completely 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.870
 new game originally sharpened precisely on 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.210
 touch screen 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.039
 you do not need now to knock the mobile 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 the table due to the fact that the worm off a cliff 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.809
 now everything has fallen down more prosaically 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.030
 improved native graphics management and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.890
 general mood at the height 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.050
 so what brought us a pair of worms 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.179
 words of lyrical digression my 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.670
 familiarity with worms began with the console 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.130
 sega in the 90s ended worms world 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.289
 party on the pis and all kinds of port and me 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.149
 avoided as a whole port and do not like 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.429
 each game should initially 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.709
 sharpened under its platform well 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.869
 Now you can remember how she was 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.729
 the third part of the worms kept all 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.940
 series chips it would be foolish to try 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.270
 change something already tried at times 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.729
 worms 3d enough everything is saved exactly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.190
 as it should be youth 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.489
 screaming a little 2d and why such graphics 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.069
 and that's because it ’s all about it 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:52.590
 chip game its charm and even graphics here 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.289
 generally need a hedgehog 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.369
 T-shirt We played quite 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.590
 another reason 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.689
 it is their gameplay on the one hand 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 simple and on the other such variable 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.909
 draws us to the screen whether it's recording 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.429
 or now here android well what are you i 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.860
 praise and specifically do not tell 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.480
 kind of be maybe someone has worms and no rumors 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.780
 heard briefly describe all the gameplay in 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.239
 we have a team of worms and the enemy have 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.030
 you have an arsenal of all kinds of cool 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.400
 trunks and jokes and the enemy and what 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.739
 need to do so the enemy put out 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.170
 for this we take turns walking our own 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.569
 action movies during the course you can 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 walk jump aim and shoot 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.190
 shooting is done by choosing a weapon 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.470
 on keeping angle of attack and hold 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.879
 power volley while you need to consider 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.579
 weather 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.430
 If the wind is in the face, then the launched grenade 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.760
 can fly back a few words about 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.430
 weapons here is something different here 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.829
 grandma exploding bananas 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.700
 shahid grenade launchers machine guns in general 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:05.100
 what is there just no just for that and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.410
 love worms however game worms 3 except 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.170
 standard gameplay offers us and 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.720
 various innovations for example several 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.569
 modes including network where possible by 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.269
 Internet with a friend cut in the local 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.010
 the game is also innovation there is a mountain of bodies mode 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.480
 where one single chirp should 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.819
 fend off several 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.459
 or playing with a friend on the same device and 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.380
 although it used to be but much more 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.900
 diversity brought the so-called 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.730
 card thing is that you can include 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.470
 card game function when before 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.540
 every turn you can play 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.880
 several bonus cards for example 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.760
 reduce gravity for this at the beginning 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.040
 battlefield we collect a deck mode very 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.079
 doubtful especially for conservatively 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.180
 minded players but for beginners 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.519
 will by the way about the cards 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.130
 their three types are bronze silver and 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.970
 gold they are taken in the store for real 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.739
 except that the game is paid there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.780
 microtransactions, though small, can 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.900
 buy a pack of golden oslo cards 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.930
 which will help the company with difficulty 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.269
 them missions and sets of patriots yes to them 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.489
 dwell in detail if earlier we 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.579
 could creating a team just give a name 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.220
 the worms are a little different now 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.459
 we can customize our whole team 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.620
 choosing glasses and a mustache cap so here's a set and 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.960
 patriots from nothing more than items 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:29.360
 national style for example hat 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.910
 ushanka for Russia but otherwise 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.430
 we are all the same good old thief 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.680
 which will not get bored and when 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.710
 how much they are cut so much and 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.389
 will be cut no less just great 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.210
 a game that everyone should have 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.729
 connoisseur of the original worms she sim 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.889
