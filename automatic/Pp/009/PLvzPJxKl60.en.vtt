00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.949
 I would like but in principle here it is so 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 tele this game is truly homely or 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.230
 there is a contract somewhere that all the same 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.230
 We're not playing in our hometown, but it's me that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.739
 more people have come 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.489
 for us and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.489

 my disqualification in several 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.840
 experimental this composition is not the most 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.850
 familiar and played cool you probably 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.110
 as a coach it added a certain 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.820
 headache because now 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.190
 disqualifications ended in the same 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.900
 the axes know the same emelyanova but at the same time 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.920

 in the tournament plan for the Ural one of 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.830
