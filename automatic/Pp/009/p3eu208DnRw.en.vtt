00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.840 
to come up here to your color power and
you<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.800> switch<00:02:37.040> over<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.430> stroke

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
you want to switch over to stroke

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.950 
you want to switch over to stroke
because<00:02:38.330> we're<00:02:38.480> going<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.660> be<00:02:38.780> at

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
because we're going to be at

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.690 
because we're going to be at
and<00:02:40.960> all<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.320> do<00:02:41.470> here<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.340> always<00:02:42.550> want

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and all you do here is you always want

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.200 
and all you do here is you always want
to<00:02:43.470> trap<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.980> lighter<00:02:45.250> color<00:02:45.610> into<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
to trap the lighter color into the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.820 
to trap the lighter color into the
darker<00:02:46.570> color<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.290> we're<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.680> be

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
darker color so we're going to be

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.410 
darker color so we're going to be
trapping<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.720> guess<00:02:50.320> steel<00:02:50.950> cover<00:02:51.760> into

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
trapping the I guess steel cover into

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.160 
trapping the I guess steel cover into
the<00:02:52.450> block<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:54.100> we<00:02:54.130> had

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the block so we had

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.559 
the block so we had
stroke<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.520> tee

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
stroke of the tee

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.809

and<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.349> can<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.040> did<00:02:59.250> change<00:02:59.549> the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
and as you can see it did change the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.559 
and as you can see it did change the
artwork<00:03:00.120> did<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.689> can<00:03:00.840> see<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.079> little<00:03:01.319> bit

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
to do here it's just add a stroke it

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
to do here it's just add a stroke it

now<00:05:18.500> here<00:05:19.010> what<00:05:19.220> we're<00:05:19.340> going<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.670> do

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
now here what we're going to do

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:32.159 
now here what we're going to do
we're<00:05:21.860> going<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.190> take<00:05:22.430> each<00:05:22.760> of<00:05:23.330> these<00:05:23.480> trips

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.969 

to<00:05:32.349> be<00:05:32.469> done<00:05:32.650> individually

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.550 

we're<00:05:39.979> just<00:05:40.130> going<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.520> pick<00:05:40.729> up<00:05:41.290> one<00:05:42.290> of<00:05:42.320> these

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
we're just going to pick up one of these

strings

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.909 

so<00:05:48.810> now<00:05:48.960> we<00:05:49.020> have<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.410> same<00:05:49.650> gradient<00:05:50.280> on

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
so now we have the same gradient on

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.409 
so now we have the same gradient on
on<00:05:51.400> this<00:05:51.879> fill<00:05:52.419> here<00:05:52.780> as<00:05:53.020> we<00:05:53.319> do<00:05:53.499> here<00:05:54.360> now<00:05:55.360> the

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
on this fill here as we do here now the

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.360 
on this fill here as we do here now the
reason<00:05:55.840> we<00:05:55.960> went<00:05:56.110> through<00:05:56.439> that<00:05:56.620> all<00:05:56.919> course

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
reason we went through that all course

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.459

we<00:05:57.610> can<00:05:57.819> add<00:05:57.969> track<00:05:58.270> and<00:05:58.539> from<00:05:58.749> here<00:05:59.110> we're

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
we can add track and from here we're

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:06.200 
we can add track and from here we're
going<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.889> tell<00:06:00.099> it<00:06:00.129> to<00:06:00.490> overprint<00:06:01.419> fill<00:06:03.960> now

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
going to tell it to overprint fill now

you<00:06:07.210> can<00:06:07.389> actually<00:06:07.569> see<00:06:08.430> where<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:09.580> has<00:06:09.729> strap
