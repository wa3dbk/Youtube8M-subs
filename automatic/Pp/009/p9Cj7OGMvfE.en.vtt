 in Winnipeg when I arrived I

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.000
 we will say that the universal codes are only 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 Senegalese families and familiar 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.320

 one of the focal points of the digital 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.699
 really I find that the mix 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.980
 cultural heritage is respected and there are all 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.730
 the nationalities of china up 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.550

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.989

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 I like people go by so that's 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.920
 the opportunity to meet my friends who 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.130

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130
 choice 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 something that you will consider as 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.080
 goats me I come for french group 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 English mix in sum can be 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 go elsewhere this budget as 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.830
 man shares is part of Quebec 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 waits for the world of France by beating 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 the movement then the tax to things 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.280
 also as a blow to expectations this 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280
 season 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.310
 the cias because I had the bac s 2 op 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.000
 science physical biology alone but 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.460
 I like this 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.280
 it would be astrology since they are 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.280
 close at the obstat level not the ransom 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.500
 it's the club that explains a lot 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.690
 more about the courts I also like the teacher 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.290
 who also spends his time smiling 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.160
 for students to centralize who 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 is welcoming who explains well and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.120
 with whom everything is made comfortable what I 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.190
 I would almost be able to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.580
 sit down with me who crashes time 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.930
