larger<00:02:58.799> but<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.580> based<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.420> community

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
larger but it's based on that community

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.210 
larger but it's based on that community
type<00:03:01.890> thing<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.530> which<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:04.860> makes<00:03:05.040> this

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
type thing and which is what makes this

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.290
