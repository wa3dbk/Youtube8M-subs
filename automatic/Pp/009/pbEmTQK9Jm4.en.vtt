00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
on the top of the nail you can draw

on the top of the nail you can draw
wherever<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.329> prefer

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.760 

so<00:01:10.869> I'm<00:01:11.320> going<00:01:12.189> to<00:01:12.250> let<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.909> color<00:01:13.780> try<00:01:14.170> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so I'm going to let the color try and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.389 
so I'm going to let the color try and
after<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.890> dry<00:01:18.189> I'm<00:01:19.060> going<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.750> apply<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:21.159> a

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
after is dry I'm going to apply just a

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.679 
after is dry I'm going to apply just a
clear<00:01:22.000> top<00:01:22.420> coat<00:01:23.579> because<00:01:24.579> we<00:01:25.060> are<00:01:25.270> going<00:01:25.539> to

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
clear top coat because we are going to

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.809 
clear top coat because we are going to
add<00:01:26.009> three<00:01:27.009> clear<00:01:27.490> rhinestones<00:01:28.979> between<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
add three clear rhinestones between the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.100 
add three clear rhinestones between the
two<00:01:31.360> lines<00:01:31.659> I<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.149> size<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.840> this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
two lines I think the size of this

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.969 
two lines I think the size of this
rhinestones<00:01:35.799> is<00:01:36.100> 2.5<00:01:37.000> mm<00:01:37.840> there's<00:01:38.679> another

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
rhinestones is 2.5 mm there's another

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.669 
rhinestones is 2.5 mm there's another
size<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.789> smaller<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:41.049> one<00:01:41.289> I<00:01:41.590> think

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
size that is smaller so this one I think

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:51.130 
size that is smaller so this one I think
is<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.219> medium<00:01:42.700> size

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.469 

so<00:01:51.740> I'm<00:01:51.830> just<00:01:52.040> placing<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.520> rhinestones<00:01:53.240> on

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
so I'm just placing the rhinestones on

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.220 
so I'm just placing the rhinestones on
the<00:01:53.600> nail

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.120 

you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.900 

after<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.310> I'm<00:02:06.670> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.180> apply<00:02:07.450> another

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
after that I'm going to apply another

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
after that I'm going to apply another
top<00:02:09.910> coat<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.500> songs<00:02:11.800> won't<00:02:12.730> fall<00:02:13.060> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
top coat so the songs won't fall and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.790 
top coat so the songs won't fall and
won't<00:02:14.560> move<00:02:14.740> as<00:02:14.980> well<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> after<00:02:19.569> dry<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.470> can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
won't move as well so after dry you can

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.059 
won't move as well so after dry you can
leave<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.190> manicure<00:02:21.910> as<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.680> I'm

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069
