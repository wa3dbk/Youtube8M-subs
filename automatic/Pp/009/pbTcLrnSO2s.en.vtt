streak as you guys probably know the
VTOL<00:03:17.709> warship<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.189> a<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.609> very<00:03:18.849> large

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
VTOL warship is a very very large

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.210 
VTOL warship is a very very large
killstreak<00:03:20.139> it's<00:03:20.290> very<00:03:20.500> visible<00:03:20.980> from<00:03:21.159> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
killstreak it's very visible from the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.759 
killstreak it's very visible from the
air<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.430> very<00:03:21.669> easily<00:03:22.060> shot<00:03:22.510> down<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.049> so<00:03:23.620> it

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
air it's very easily shot down and so it

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.229 
air it's very easily shot down and so it
can't<00:03:23.980> really<00:03:24.069> maneuver<00:03:24.549> about<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.970> map

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
can't really maneuver about the map

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.180 
can't really maneuver about the map
super<00:03:25.930> well<00:03:26.049> without<00:03:26.319> being<00:03:26.590> noticed<00:03:26.769> without

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
super well without being noticed without

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.699 
super well without being noticed without
being<00:03:27.400> taken<00:03:27.790> out<00:03:27.940> fairly<00:03:28.269> quickly<00:03:28.419> so<00:03:29.079> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
being taken out fairly quickly so the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.710 
being taken out fairly quickly so the
VTOL<00:03:30.010> warship<00:03:30.280> coming<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.120> at<00:03:31.209> number<00:03:31.299> seven

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
VTOL warship coming in at number seven

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.089 
VTOL warship coming in at number seven
it's<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> destructive<00:03:32.349> kill<00:03:32.530> streak<00:03:32.769> although

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
it's a destructive kill streak although

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.520 
it's a destructive kill streak although
it<00:03:33.459> can<00:03:33.639> be<00:03:33.729> shot<00:03:33.909> down<00:03:34.090> very<00:03:34.359> easily<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:35.019> lot<00:03:35.409> of

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
it can be shot down very easily a lot of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.050 
it can be shot down very easily a lot of
the<00:03:35.590> time<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.069> it's<00:03:36.099> not<00:03:36.340> always<00:03:36.579> super

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
the time so it's not always super

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.240 
the time so it's not always super
effective<00:03:37.510> now<00:03:38.349> let's<00:03:38.530> move<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.829> into<00:03:39.040> the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
such an iconic kill streak in so many

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.600 
such an iconic kill streak in so many
gameplays<00:04:32.380> from<00:04:32.620> way<00:04:32.770> back<00:04:32.979> in<00:04:33.219> the<00:04:33.250> day

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.670 
gameplays from way back in the day
I<00:04:33.639> figured<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.389> deserved<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.780> nice<00:04:34.960> high<00:04:35.319> spot

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
I figured it deserved a nice high spot

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.290 
I figured it deserved a nice high spot
on<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.129> list<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.460> coming<00:04:36.819> in<00:04:36.879> at<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.090> number

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
on the list so coming in at the number

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.270 
on the list so coming in at the number
five<00:04:37.449> spot<00:04:37.599> we<00:04:37.780> have<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> Harrier<00:04:38.740> air<00:04:38.979> strike

an absolute monster kill streak and that

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.350 
an absolute monster kill streak and that
is<00:05:18.129> why<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.310> comes<00:05:18.580> in<00:05:18.729> at<00:05:18.879> the<00:05:18.969> number<00:05:19.180> four

plays<00:05:43.509> are<00:05:43.690> pretty<00:05:43.900> much<00:05:44.020> brought<00:05:44.319> together

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
plays are pretty much brought together

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.649 
plays are pretty much brought together
and<00:05:44.979> made<00:05:45.159> possible<00:05:45.400> because<00:05:45.819> of<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.240> orbital

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
and made possible because of the orbital

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.749 
and made possible because of the orbital
vsat<00:05:46.870> being<00:05:47.800> able<00:05:48.009> to<00:05:48.099> know<00:05:48.250> your<00:05:48.430> enemies

those<00:05:50.409> little<00:05:51.009> orange<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.669> red<00:05:51.909> nacho

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:52.839 
those little orange and red nacho

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.469 
those little orange and red nacho
doritos<00:05:52.990> up<00:05:53.529> in<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.740> corner<00:05:54.129> just<00:05:54.819> absolutely

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
doritos up in the corner just absolutely

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.600 
doritos up in the corner just absolutely
made<00:05:55.839> the<00:05:55.870> game<00:05:56.139> so<00:05:56.529> much<00:05:56.800> easier<00:05:57.279> and<00:05:57.310> so<00:05:57.550> much

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
made the game so much easier and so much

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.719 
made the game so much easier and so much
more<00:05:58.210> fun<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.259> go<00:05:59.560> for<00:05:59.770> game<00:05:59.919> plays<00:06:00.159> in<00:06:00.490> and

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
more fun to go for game plays in and

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.670 
more fun to go for game plays in and
that<00:06:01.029> is<00:06:01.150> why<00:06:01.300> the<00:06:01.360> orbital<00:06:01.810> vsat<00:06:01.930> comes<00:06:02.319> in<00:06:02.469> at

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
that is why the orbital vsat comes in at

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.959 
that is why the orbital vsat comes in at
the<00:06:02.800> number<00:06:03.009> 3<00:06:03.219> spot<00:06:03.250> on<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.699> countdown
