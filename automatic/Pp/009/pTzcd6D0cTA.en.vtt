okay<00:00:05.200> the<00:00:05.500> proof<00:00:05.710> test<00:00:06.009> here's<00:00:06.970> what<00:00:07.120> we<00:00:07.180> got

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
okay the proof test here's what we got

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.330 
okay the proof test here's what we got
here's<00:00:08.260> how<00:00:08.349> they<00:00:08.440> used<00:00:08.590> to<00:00:08.620> test<00:00:08.830> proof<00:00:09.099> back

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
here's how they used to test proof back

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.970 
here's how they used to test proof back

a little bit damp affect all the grains

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.460 
a little bit damp affect all the grains
now<00:02:52.300> still<00:02:53.300> not<00:02:53.450> working

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.180 

I<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.880> just<00:03:00.150> paid<00:03:00.390> for<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:01.070> right<00:03:02.070> I'm

so<00:04:09.060> we'll<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.390> same<00:04:09.570> thing<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.769> first

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
so we'll do the same thing but first

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.699 
so we'll do the same thing but first
let's<00:04:12.300> do<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.480> let's<00:04:12.870> do<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.080> control<00:04:13.350> test

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
let's do the let's do the control test

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.830 
let's do the let's do the control test
again<00:04:14.040> because<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> mean<00:04:14.610> seriously<00:04:15.570> who<00:04:15.690> just

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.430 
again because I mean seriously who just
doesn't<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.229> blow<00:04:16.380> shit<00:04:16.440> up<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.239> we'll

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
doesn't like to blow shit up so we'll

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.870 
doesn't like to blow shit up so we'll
give<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.560> one<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.830> run<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.609> show<00:04:20.790> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
give this one a run just to show you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.219 
give this one a run just to show you
what<00:04:21.000> happens<00:04:21.330> with<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.479> straight<00:04:21.750> gunpowder

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
what happens with a straight gunpowder

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:29.930 
what happens with a straight gunpowder
once<00:04:22.530> again<00:04:27.320> do<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.440> right<00:04:28.650> between<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.250> 151

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
once again do it right between the 151

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.719 
once again do it right between the 151
and<00:04:29.970> 100<00:04:30.750> proof<00:04:30.930> liquor<00:04:31.440> which<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.950> how<00:04:32.669> you

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
and 100 proof liquor which is how you

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.950 
and 100 proof liquor which is how you
want<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.060> do<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:34.460> notice<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.490> lack<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.060> glasses

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
want to do it notice the lack of glasses

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.030 
want to do it notice the lack of glasses
there<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:37.710> go

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
there we go

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.280 
there we go
so<00:04:38.550> there<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.729> got<00:04:38.910> your<00:04:39.090> control<00:04:39.750> that's

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
so there you got your control that's

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.420 
so there you got your control that's
what<00:04:40.500> happens<00:04:40.800> when<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:40.979> do<00:04:41.100> straight

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
what happens when you do straight

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.590 
what happens when you do straight
gunpowder<00:04:42.050> can<00:04:43.050> do<00:04:43.200> now<00:04:44.060> same<00:04:45.060> as<00:04:45.180> before

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
gunpowder can do now same as before

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.080 
gunpowder can do now same as before
eighth<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.270> teaspoon<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.870> powder<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:50.090> each

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:01.839 
yeah but short on that one there we go

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.469 
yeah but short on that one there we go
so<00:05:02.839> get<00:05:03.259> the<00:05:03.409> powder<00:05:03.619> in<00:05:03.859> there<00:05:04.299> now<00:05:05.299> we're

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
so get the powder in there now we're

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:15.189 
so get the powder in there now we're
going<00:05:05.809> with<00:05:11.679> with<00:05:12.679> ten<00:05:13.039> drops<00:05:13.339> of<00:05:13.759> liquor<00:05:14.689> into

now<00:06:26.070> let's<00:06:26.639> see<00:06:26.790> what<00:06:26.910> happens<00:06:27.300> we<00:06:27.600> start<00:06:27.870> with

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
now let's see what happens we start with

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:37.879 
now let's see what happens we start with
the<00:06:28.290> oh<00:06:29.180> hey<00:06:30.180> let's<00:06:30.330> start<00:06:30.509> with<00:06:30.630> 150<00:06:31.020> one<00:06:36.889> day

the oh hey let's start with 150 one day

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.580 
the oh hey let's start with 150 one day
this<00:06:38.250> test<00:06:38.580> is<00:06:38.759> hell<00:06:39.030> on<00:06:39.270> these<00:06:39.590> grill

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
this test is hell on these grill

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:49.180 
this test is hell on these grill
starters<00:06:44.570> not<00:06:45.570> happen<00:06:45.960> on<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:46.139> Food<00:06:46.350> Channel

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:55.430 

okay

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.520 

1:51<00:06:56.610> seems<00:06:57.610> good<00:06:57.880> let's<00:06:58.840> try<00:06:59.020> the<00:06:59.080> Woodford

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
1:51 seems good let's try the Woodford

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.340 
1:51 seems good let's try the Woodford
Reserve<00:07:00.030> again<00:07:01.030> this<00:07:01.210> is<00:07:01.389> just<00:07:01.600> over<00:07:01.840> 90<00:07:02.169> proof

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
Reserve again this is just over 90 proof

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.939 
Reserve again this is just over 90 proof
so<00:07:03.340> is<00:07:03.550> a<00:07:03.580> more<00:07:04.509> water<00:07:04.810> than<00:07:05.139> alcohol<00:07:05.680> in<00:07:05.830> this

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949 
so is a more water than alcohol in this

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.020 
so is a more water than alcohol in this
unlike<00:07:06.430> likely<00:07:06.910> that<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:08.250> alcohol<00:07:09.250> is<00:07:09.729> not

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
unlike likely that the alcohol is not

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.670 
unlike likely that the alcohol is not
displacing<00:07:10.539> the<00:07:10.720> water<00:07:10.930> water<00:07:11.259> is<00:07:11.410> killing

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
displacing the water water is killing

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.740 
displacing the water water is killing

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
the lychee add to potassium killing the

the lychee add to potassium killing the

gunpowder's not up to proof not proven

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.200 
gunpowder's not up to proof not proven
and<00:07:16.720> then<00:07:17.020> we<00:07:17.110> get<00:07:17.229> to<00:07:17.350> that<00:07:17.470> exactly<00:07:18.280> 50%<00:07:18.729> see

100% what's going on with its burnin got

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.230 
100% what's going on with its burnin got
a<00:07:26.080> little<00:07:26.260> blue<00:07:26.380> flame<00:07:26.710> going<00:07:26.979> in<00:07:27.160> there<00:07:27.340> but

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 
a little blue flame going in there but

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.570 
a little blue flame going in there but
it<00:07:28.300> looks<00:07:28.449> like<00:07:28.630> we're<00:07:28.870> not<00:07:29.080> still<00:07:29.949> not<00:07:29.979> proven

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 
it looks like we're not still not proven

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.800 
it looks like we're not still not proven
even<00:07:30.789> though<00:07:30.880> it<00:07:30.970> says<00:07:31.150> on<00:07:31.300> the<00:07:31.389> label<00:07:31.419> it's

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
even though it says on the label it's

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.000 
even though it says on the label it's
proven<00:07:32.139> then<00:07:32.260> again<00:07:32.440> this<00:07:32.560> bottles<00:07:32.919> been
