you who don't know hardline makes it so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
you who don't know hardline makes it so
that<00:00:30.240> way<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.570> need<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.230> less<00:00:31.470> point<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
next kill streak hardline pro makes it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
next kill streak hardline pro makes it
so<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.570> every<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.320> assists<00:00:38.040> count<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
