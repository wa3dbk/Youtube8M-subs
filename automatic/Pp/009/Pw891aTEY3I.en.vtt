 kfz helpline de the internet portal around 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.309
 to your car presents you car and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.309
 traffic 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.690
 the adac offers its members but 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 also not members the so-called 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 used car check this is one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 Examination where a vehicle on heart 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 and kidney is checked so that one 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 buy interesting can be sure 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 that he can purchase this vehicle 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 that everything is ok or too 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.700
 someone selling his vehicle 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.350
 I want to be sure that everything is in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.190
 order is so that he is with quiet 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.399
 certain the vehicle can sell 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.769
 the used car check includes 120 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.199
 Test points takes about an hour and 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.460
 is for members for the price of 65 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.420
 Euro offered 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.219
 Non-members pay â‚¬ 89 in the frame 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.960
 the adac used car examinations 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.180
 of course we have several checkpoints 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.079
 one of them is the control of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.399
 light plant 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.739
 on the one hand all 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.329
 But lighting also controls the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.220
 headlight on your setting 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.479
 controlled and when needed 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.869
 sometimes one or the other light bulb 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.149
 already exchanged will continue at one 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.039
 Also, used car inspection will be 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.780
 Shock absorber the functionality of the 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.640
 bumper checked that is, the so 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.890
 said residual vibration behavior is 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.600
 checked on the test bench and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.550
 later, of course, again the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.500
 shock absorbers on the lift on 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.929
 Checked for tightness means that has here 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.810
 to get a full diagnosis 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.520
 report on the shock absorbers something in 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.180
 the normal workshop just over the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.430
 Visual inspection would not be possible 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.620
 in the field of brakes testing becomes 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.480
 first with us the braking effect 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.710
 checked both the so-called 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.180
 service brake on the front and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.790
 rear axle as well as at the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.770
 Parking brake so on the handbrake 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.020
 and there you can already see if the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.870
 brake system is freely available so that is 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.600
 no no cylinder is stuck here and 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.460
 A stiff brake also occurs 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.800
 that the braking effect is even 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.790
 and then we check the brake system 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.280
 Of course, at a visual inspection 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.350
 on the lift again that for 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.820
 Once we talk about the condition of 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.619
 brake discs and also the brake pads 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.270
 so we can provide a picture 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.780
 then a full examination of the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.160
 brake system can also grant here 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.810
 one of the most important checkpoints is 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.910
 of course the vehicle's inspection 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.950
 on his volume at it one can 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.870
 Information about possible repair 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.550
 collecting traces of any accidents 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 And that will be with a paint strength 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.140
 Measuring device performed here can 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.330
 you realize how much value there is 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.550
 and you can determine if 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.450
 we have a original finish or 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.100
 here also one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.330
 repainting possibly even with 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.400
 putty work is present 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.780
 during a visual inspection of the engine compartment 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.160
 is within the framework of used cars 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
 Examination for example all 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.880
 fluid levels controlled 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.710
 antifreeze content is checked the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.030
 battery when sitting in the engine compartment 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.520
 will of course also be controlled 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.010
 start performance but it will be the 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.450
 Timing belt on its corresponding 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.250
 condition but also the V-belt 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.400
 checked and of course for the whole 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.550
 engine oil leaks checked out 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.560
 as well as all lines 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.330
 looked at if there maybe for it 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.060
 biss traces are on it means that here 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.410
 is exactly the large magnifying glass 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.350
 if everything really looked in here 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.640
 order is just such tests 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.290
 example of the wheel bearing or the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.090
 the front axle is free of play 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.820
 of course for the layman on the spot 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.720
 dealer or private seller even 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.450
 not tradable 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.680
 Of course we can do that with ours 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.300
 do wonderful workshop equipment 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.430
 and check and of course the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.020
 Underbody is no problem for us 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.890
 we have lift lifts and there we can 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.050
 of course one again 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.790
 Visual inspection of all important 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.250
 components of the steering over the 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.890
 suspension the brake system the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.660
 Shock absorbers there are all points 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.890
 of course will be checked as well 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.590
 in older vehicles altogether 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.900
 of course, the weak points and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.459
 maybe big herd specifically 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.739
 maybe at one 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.630
 vehicle that is prone to this 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.100
 problems prevail or even there 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.510
 Everything is once in order 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.010
 Of course we also offer the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.380
 interested in buying or even the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.080
 willing to sell a determination of 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.990
 vehicle prices we can after the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.310
 at or schwacken notation here determine 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.290
 what the vehicle with its equipment 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.670
 and with his kilometers driven 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.980
 Worth so you can get one too 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.989
 clue has for the purchase if there is one 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.060
 cheap offer is or for the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.160
 sale that you do not correspond 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.500
 Satisfied with cheap deals 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.120
 had our used cars 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.310
 studies or ours 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.810
 free services are worthwhile 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.640
 Of course, not only when I enter 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.020
 sell or buy a vehicle 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.580
 maybe the lease returnable to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.800
 stands but actually 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.240
 regularly look to as the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.100
 condition of the vehicle in front of one 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.780
 holiday trip for example, that there 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.070
 is on the safe side and calms down 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.070
 the next kilometer ahead of you 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.409
 kfz helpline de the internet portal around 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.680
 to their car presented to you car and 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.680
