 Of course he is going to prepare a cake that is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 a cake with tartar is a preparation 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.180
 in raw tuna that we are going to make and what 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 we will align with a garnish or 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
 vinaigrette rather we have done to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 tangerine juice base the skins of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.939
 Mandarin and sesame oil miami 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 here is something that is welcome 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.149
 carpenters design of tartar or tartar no 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.520
 Tartar letter row address cake cake 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's practically the same only 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.899
 we're going to Tatar and we 're going to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.420
 make with ground beef and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 this good what we are going to do the day 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.520
 today we have some tuna cubes 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.520
 completely fresh very well raw 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.949
 you do not have to do anything other than 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.199
 example the times the tuna has that 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.160
 black vein or blood beta nothing else 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.170
 than to withdraw it because that's where 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.239
 contains blood and good taste yesterday 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.049
 They wanted to honor that part else it 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.540
 we have here in a few cubes to see 10 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.990
 and you did it was very easy only 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.420
 we have to take in a bowl cut to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 squeeze mandarin juice all the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.150
 tangerine skins are also 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.100
 let's put there so that same 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 essential oil that you have at the time of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.720
 that we make the emulsion 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.670
 unstable is going to keep completely 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.460
 all the perfume and so that we 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 we can also have that fat touch and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.369
 so that it can be called a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.149
 vinaigrette we also need a little bit of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.280
 oil each one we think good the most 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.810
 It is advisable to use an oil that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.520
 can be consumed completely raw 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.619
 like olive oil ok 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.750
 we use a part of olive oil and what 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.399
 perfumed with sesame oil but 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.960
 although it seems like the only thing we do for 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.030
 example aircraft that will start doing 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.399
 valleys is very simple we take 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.890
 only the tuna that we put here in 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.080
 our our bowl 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.030
 more or less an approximate amount of 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.470
 about 100 150 grams we are going to put here 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.140
 in our vinaigrette that I have all 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.750
 I'm going to show you right here 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.330
 Here are all the aromas 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.130
 sensor and cowell is like a predominant 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.690
 little bit of sesame oil, yes, but 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.430
 has the cities of italy in the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.890
 market then we bought the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.380
 mandarin is here let's support you a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.270
 little bit of sun repression and perfect salt 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.100
 very well is not a little bit of Sara in 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 our preparation we mix 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.810
 perfectly fine very well what this one 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.930
 start to take a little bit of flavor 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.150
 let's do the following let's put 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.910
 this the passion fruit we know is a 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.460
 completely acid fruit not and that has 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.670
 little black spots the little seeds 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.820
 that we did in this case good 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 we start from some caramelized seeds 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.850
 crushed with passion fruit pulp 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.020
 caramelized onions left a lot 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.060
 time on the onion 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.300
 the very low temperature with very 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.250
 little fat super thin to fire 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.880
 very very slow until they soften 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.880
 completely 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.160
 and then later on that 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.410
 we liquefy a little bit of ginger because 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.690
 the same saudi caramelized the puree of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.640
 passion fruit very well and super crushed and 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.540
 then from there I can prove it 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.540
 of course 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.480
 from there we formed this poor little 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.480
 of passion fruit and here we have 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.099
 and then good once I already 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.549
 we have everything ready what we are going to 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.569
 start part of our plating 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.129
 show off the dishes that are sending 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.340

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.409
 lamb are handmade dishes of these 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.569
 not the people of oaxaca exactly 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.220

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.720

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.739
 of such utensils and 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.569
 slabs that are usually handmade and 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.069
 also helping a lot to the part of 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.720
 the Mexican crafts that marvel 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.760
 possibilities to instinct first with the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.650
 contact support so that by the way 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.329
 courses and diplomas are great 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.669
 it has to go true if it is 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.859
 thinking that I'm going to study and not 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.660
 It has no place to go for a little spin 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.280
 surely the great ones that are there 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.810

 the doors open for all 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.639
 tastes for all exactly already 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.530

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.630
 anyone who in now who has 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.280
 desire to study to forge in this 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.380
 wonderful career that is the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.740
 gastronomy of truth go des a 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.000
 return, go ahead, do not stay more mom 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.380
 if you do not know what to do with this 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.180
 teenager who does not feel like

 suddenly to do many things to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.419
 push it a little take it to school 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.389
 Gastronomy is a very good alternative 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.949
 it's very, very good, it's really like that 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.479
 the best is not very good for physics 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.919
 for us to physics to what 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.599
 which are very good for the kitchen 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.370
 we have realized you can take your 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.530
 course can go for a while a diploma 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.300
 small clear is impossible to realize 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.889
 who loves cooking there is no 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.750
 a lot of people that you have seen it in 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.520
 Many chefs have almost started that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.900
 they do not know what to do with their lives 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.000
 they knew what to do studied in some 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.069
 engineering we have see in that 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.659
 we have architects and then and suddenly 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.060
 the gastronomy won them then by 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.740
 please take a little spin to the institute 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.580
 with the settler who are appearing go 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.090
 To appear 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.090
 the law of cameras 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.689
 doing now let's complement already 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.789
 our our plate remember that 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.969
 we continue marinating our fish very 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.969
 all right 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.650
 with our ball to go to the final 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.430
 that 's what that is and obviously 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.040
 we leave a part of the of the 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.250
 of the skin to see with these 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.010
 principles that can be achieved in some 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.900
 kind of specialized ways in your 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:17.200
 defect then it is in the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:18.490
 dental offices or the dentist 's 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.020
 the bakery the first one that I had 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.180
 maradona for many years tasks 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.860
 because we can not get them good 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.530
 more I will be them when I borrow 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.690
 look let's proceed we already have our 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.610
 puree on this side and mother who owes this 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.420
 and we put a few seeds of 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.460
 sesame 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.270
 very nice touch and very good then 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.610
 simulates perfectly as if this were 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:43.470
 our passion fruit without straining not clear by 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:46.720
 course if we have here our tartar 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.940
 I already saw that easy recipe is not with 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.560
 little ingredients success of doing very 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.840
 fast and very fast good friend very 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.840
 Our product showed it simple 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.690
 right here on our plate 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.700
 and now with our pieces these same 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:06.750
 let's help to finish this 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:09.360
 part our sabina cucumber another by 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.530
 here we have some cherry tomatoes ok what 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.660
 what we did is like a pot 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.130
 they did what I just like 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:22.580
 We put in boiling water 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:24.780
 this work of some a cross 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.640
 almost nothing requirement and then 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.210
 the hair and then up is so 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.520
 fabulous must do that and here for 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.280
 example we also have sweet potato chips 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.430
 sweet potato chip very very easy to make 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.740
 as yellow 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.670
 you can see that everything was having 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.440
 too much texture and this is furic that 

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.570
 Fincan that you can get it is already a 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.880
 mix of seeds that can 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.550
 get in the super on the loose of the
