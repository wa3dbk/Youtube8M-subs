 munhoz 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 W 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120
 ae 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 the girls of sinha 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.649
 we are solving the malaise 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:53.269
 she sites part of an LP that has a lot of other enriching folks going 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.679
 have said one more but they will only start there is it starts 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.749
 the agreements and it has a very interesting climate and has a following course 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.179
 wake up room 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.259
 drop 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 So start with this sun quintet. 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.919
 to talk to this show 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:21.099
 these three chords that prepares the beginning of the song is a very 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.879
 interesting then 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.760
 is an important feature of the dodÃ´ ritchie blackmore assured expensive 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.430
 comments 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.459
 is that he is an economic guy one thing that has to learn a lot with him 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.420
 they are there 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.709
 and he says he does not need to touch 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.920
 this is very interesting 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.580
 he knows that he gives only one note in a whole settlement citizen because he has the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.319
 base of the keyboard in some places it does not play 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.660
 times when at the end of music instead of giving the agreement he takes hold of the 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.660
 drummer he closes the potential of what I could witness this was not 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.859
 what I saw 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.449
 that Christmas and that he had not noticed just listening, and we'll realize 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.430
 that things are really very simple 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.459
 most often the most complicated solution 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.519
 start with the song with this 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.099
 with the sun and the minimum compal had kiel 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:13.739
 a right hand drowning wakes moorman immunize you to practically just this 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.870
 while keyboard does some things, there's still loud music 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.680
 I 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.940
 language and on top of this from here all over the world 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.789
 When are you going to talk to? 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.669
 - We already have a little more attention 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.699
 Let's hold the agreement further. 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.709
 suddenly he overcomes this minor climate 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:42.770
 frog 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.340
 the world 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.590
 it is still present margarine 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.949
 and so on 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.560
 there the music between then those chords on Thursdays is not 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.300
 a wall and prepare the entrance of a keyboard solo is that I will not comment 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.819
 here now obviously 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.550
 and then then request that he did with two vital individuals 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.670
 I'll comment on the action. 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.370
 one of them here only one of the two dates and the other is written in the score you 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.060
 You can get it that it's very similar to the first one so it's going to give it to you. 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.650
 high light grip 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.400
 then this solo it starts with a 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 this fraction by the 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.029
 this phrase that is repeated 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.039
 go there the region of ladha 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.300
 in a sequence of losses in all of them begin as 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.119
 and repeat the same sequence 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:24.240
 doctor fishes 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.290
 and there comes an interesting part that there are sixteenth-century pastors who have played 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.289
 slower and the following 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.020
 worst effect really the one that they know father 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.409
 so he needs 

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:54.969
 and the one that yes that use the color of the other miss the whole time that is the following year 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.399
 hence the effect was 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.430
 Back to English confessional series 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:18.610
 following that nikki shindo ruling on dropping it goes further 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.610
 the second time, right? 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.050
 and to finish 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.050
 the following sentence 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.250
 the world changed
