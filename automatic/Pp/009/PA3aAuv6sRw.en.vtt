00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
you get kind of warm you get really

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.290 
you get kind of warm you get really
voluminous<00:05:53.130> waves<00:05:53.699> if<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:53.970> do<00:05:54.090> it<00:05:54.150> together

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
voluminous waves if you do it together

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.830 
voluminous waves if you do it together
so<00:05:54.830> here<00:05:55.830> I'm<00:05:56.010> straightening<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:56.820> through<00:05:57.240> so

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
so here I'm straightening it through so

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.480 
so here I'm straightening it through so
that<00:05:57.990> way<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.289> curls<00:05:58.590> at<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.770> bottom<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.370> know

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
that way it curls at the bottom you know

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.820 
that way it curls at the bottom you know
but<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:00.690> think<00:06:00.750> that<00:06:01.080> when<00:06:01.229> you<00:06:01.320> curl<00:06:01.800> your

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
but I think that when you curl your

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.589 
but I think that when you curl your
extensions<00:06:02.490> and<00:06:02.729> your<00:06:02.909> hair<00:06:03.090> at<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.360> same

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
extensions and your hair at the same

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.260 
extensions and your hair at the same
time<00:06:03.949> it<00:06:04.949> I<00:06:05.340> don't<00:06:05.729> know<00:06:05.789> it<00:06:05.849> makes<00:06:05.970> your<00:06:06.150> hair

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
time it I don't know it makes your hair

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.960 
time it I don't know it makes your hair
cooler<00:06:06.599> altogether<00:06:07.380> because<00:06:07.919> your<00:06:08.430> hair<00:06:08.639> your

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220

what's making it

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.620 
what's making it
and<00:06:30.740> flowy<00:06:31.940> because<00:06:32.940> see<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.270> extensions<00:06:33.540> are

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
and flowy because see the extensions are

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.750 
and flowy because see the extensions are
kind<00:06:33.810> of<00:06:33.870> thin<00:06:34.080> and<00:06:34.110> wimpy<00:06:34.380> okay<00:06:35.280> so<00:06:35.550> then<00:06:35.700> I

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.730 
whole curl if you want more curliness

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.310 
whole curl if you want more curliness

right<00:07:34.530> here<00:07:34.590> and<00:07:35.100> then<00:07:35.250> it<00:07:35.340> will<00:07:35.400> give<00:07:35.580> you

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.670 
right here and then it will give you

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.850 
right here and then it will give you
more<00:07:35.850> curl<00:07:36.210> but<00:07:36.660> I<00:07:36.720> like<00:07:36.870> the<00:07:37.020> wavy<00:07:37.290> curly<00:07:37.710> look
