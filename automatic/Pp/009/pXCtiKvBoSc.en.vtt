00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 Diman created to choose from that is hundreds 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.250
 fb sent by subscribers start 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.460
 timbersaw flies kills jagernaut 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 unexpectedly but still enough 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.390
 nice look further more brutal 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.040
 Omnik and Slark are quite dangerous 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.719
 a bunch of course a little bit small 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.739
 control until omnik at least not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.460
 bleed for the middle 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.379
 but yet no less dangerous guys pomnik 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.649
 gives ripple a slurry to save the kid 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.899
 from the terrible fate but to save yourself 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 He does not seem to get to shower 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.660
 running away from zombies zombies catch up and slark 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.350
 also see injected under the hot hand but 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.199
 the next series this time he survives 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.670
 our next hero andaing always loved 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.689
 this kid then set up the volume 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.380
 household ass but the situation is enough 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.659
 dangerous because it is suitable for timberber 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.299
 Abaddon tenacious heroes flies our 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 friendly slark and anda brazen 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.240
 way here so takes away from slarke 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.090
 his kill 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
 but at the same time puts the cabinet and growth which 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 falls under hot green hand 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.560
 it seems too to go to the forefathers well 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.210
 well not bad really pawn and 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.829
 considering that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.360
 anding is restless triple kill too 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.130
 picks up cool at all a good hero 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 ruin razor i don't know what they are with 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.579
 phantom laser forgot on a hard together 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.369
 who of them helps someone 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.280
 but nonetheless even tricky digging 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.890
 your scorpion cannot do anything 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 make a true phantom of the same without hp but 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.890
 here's a scorpion 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.610
 I did not have time to try it by the way 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.590
 because after all he plays against him 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.710
 ruin which no control would be 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.420
 gave only this here is his ring as 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.600
 call it or electro ring 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.740
 the only thing that has a headache 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.480
 true first level respectively 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.560
 options so far by mans is not very 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.980
 a lot and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.190
 electro ring also kills the evening with 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.010
 profit sorry grandfather was so beautiful 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.510
 trees grew grandfather huntsman invoker 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.490
 good hero 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.490
 I'm even afraid to assume that he cooks 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.220
 the shadows 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.380
 successfully buried boy gets 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.550
 sanstrike on the head throws invoker 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.230
 and dies from the tower 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.380
 fine well just tears just tears 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.320
 poor pebble sent a great run 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:55.400
 boy us too can they go why not 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.410
 survivable guy can all push the snot 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.540
 run but with a column on your own and 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.520
 in general you overcame sometimes in my opinion not 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.080
 some breeze wimps really not yet 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.500
 nafarmili but already think that they are very 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.270
 survivors some poojas too 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.740
 also great damage from a duel and even 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.610
 taydkhanter who approached not 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.010
 needed a miner well that's god himself 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.830
 ordered to do in the head with this hero how much 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.890
 I remember once in the first point loved suicide 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.370
 on mid and both are good here 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.580
 if you put bombs really 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.420
 it looks like a sniper life has already taught to lead 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.230
 be careful 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.230
 but kliksa yet there is no end yet 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.090
 and now the sniper says goodbye to us well 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.220
 this running controller helps to finish off 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.960
 king for 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.780
 funny from nothing to just from nothing 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.040
 really turned out very well always 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.930
 would be so much ice rinks started with miners 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.180
 standard scheme we saw in one of 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.460
 past commercials and now it is popular 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.120
 on the rune wait for the course well or 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.970
 anyone 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.770
 sent a run somehow weird go 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.760
 the nap is somehow strangely letely to the throne 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.890
 Bek he knows something 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.490
 Apparently he is waiting for a jakiro who will help 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.690
 Cakir but will not help the help 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.620
 whose wife is just wonderful again and 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.620
 nakir against puja 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.430
 along with walruses of course not fair 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.950
 just not fair and of course sanstrayk 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.840
 head walker quickly played well 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.340
 guided the situation killed tamu 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.160
 not bad considering that the hero is not 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.620
 the easiest tinker is one of mine 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.570
 pets recently got a hook 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.190
 in face 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.770
 Immediately push gets an answer 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.470
 vehicle march or will it be an attempt to catch up 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.560
 oh my god here is also a ghoul 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.630
 guy more dangerous nonetheless march 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.490
 always solves questions but against the ghouls 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.930
 it seems to me in this case will be quite 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.340
 hard if you don't chris breaks when 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.130
 draws from the forest and helps temper u 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:04.210
 well turned out and here also ruff 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.280
 fish for compliments but sorry in 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.800
 Tinker is not so much strength becoming cope 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.630
 still from Gershom ok guys as always in 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.830
 head we send Dima well I do not know 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.350
 what principle does he take 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.140
 maybe for beautiful eyes or for 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.660
 something else this is not for me thanks for 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.880
