remember when I was 12 years old sitting
in<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.880> stands<00:01:13.149> watching<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.750> hut<00:01:13.930> drill<00:01:14.170> by

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
the time I left that game I knew that I

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:26.020 
the time I left that game I knew that I
was<00:01:16.960> going<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.170> be<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.289> survive<00:01:17.710> fryer

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
every time I call a Hut there's a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.020 
every time I call a Hut there's a
movement<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.250> give<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.880> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
movement you have to give me so it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.950 
movement you have to give me so it's
about<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> discipline<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:33.300> poise<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
about the discipline and the poise to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
about the discipline and the poise to
listen<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.710> me<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:34.980> watching<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> HUD<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
listen for me and watching the HUD so I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
listen for me and watching the HUD so I
just<00:01:36.120> noticed<00:01:36.480> how<00:01:36.680> structured<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.370> how

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

intense and uniform the team was how

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.630 
intense and uniform the team was how
