tell<00:00:13.530> me<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.980> boat<00:00:14.190> boat<00:00:15.060> is<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
tell me about this boat boat is a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.900 
tell me about this boat boat is a
performing<00:00:15.990> hall<00:00:16.200> it's<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.250> wooden<00:00:17.610> floor

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
performing hall it's a wooden floor

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.870 
performing hall it's a wooden floor
sport<00:00:18.450> boat<00:00:19.640> very<00:00:20.869> very<00:00:21.869> easy<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.590> plane<00:00:22.890> one

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
sport boat very very easy to plane one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.180 
sport boat very very easy to plane one
of<00:00:24.000> our<00:00:24.150> best-selling<00:00:24.600> boats<00:00:25.080> actually<00:00:25.320> okay

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
of our best-selling boats actually okay

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.609 
of our best-selling boats actually okay
and<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.900> little<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.439> more

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and so this is a little bit more

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
and so this is a little bit more
complicated<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.340> assemble<00:00:29.790> then<00:00:30.060> either<00:00:30.270> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
complicated to assemble then either the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.710 
complicated to assemble then either the
roll<00:00:30.810> up<00:00:31.050> certainly<00:00:31.950> than<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> rib<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.210> or

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
roll up certainly than a rib or the or

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.720 
roll up certainly than a rib or the or
the<00:00:33.900> high-pressure<00:00:34.260> floors<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.070> yet<00:00:35.490> you<00:00:35.579> get

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the high-pressure floors and yet you get

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
the high-pressure floors and yet you get
a<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.030> rigid<00:00:36.390> floor<00:00:36.780> structure<00:00:37.290> very

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
a really rigid floor structure very

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
a really rigid floor structure very
rigid<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> again<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> transmits<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
rigid and again it transmits the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.050 
rigid and again it transmits the
horsepower<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> motor<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.280> forward

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
horsepower from the motor to forward

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.510 
horsepower from the motor to forward
propulsion<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:43.260> efficiently<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.070> any<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.400> our

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

propulsion as efficiently as any of our
other<00:00:44.670> boats<00:00:44.970> okay<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.080> is<00:00:46.290> available

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
other boats okay and this is available

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
other boats okay and this is available
in<00:00:46.830> two<00:00:46.950> different<00:00:46.980> lengths<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.970> 275

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
in two different lengths this is the 275

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.480 
in two different lengths this is the 275
what's<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.230> other<00:00:49.380> size<00:00:49.650> the<00:00:49.980> other<00:00:50.040> side<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
what's the other size the other side is

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.240 
what's the other size the other side is
a<00:00:50.580> 310<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.810> is<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.080> a<00:00:52.140> nine<00:00:52.470> foot<00:00:52.740> boat<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a 310 this is about a nine foot boat the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
a 310 this is about a nine foot boat the
other<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.580> it's<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.850> over<00:00:54.180> 10<00:00:54.420> feet<00:00:54.660> long

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
other one it's just over 10 feet long

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.050 
other one it's just over 10 feet long
okay<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.830> this<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.310> good<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.790> mean<00:00:56.970> if

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
okay so this would be good I mean if

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.820 
okay so this would be good I mean if
you're<00:00:57.210> actually<00:00:57.630> it'll<00:00:57.990> probably<00:00:58.200> hold<00:00:58.530> four

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
you're actually it'll probably hold four

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.740 
you're actually it'll probably hold four
people<00:00:59.220> but<00:00:59.400> this<00:00:59.490> is<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.910> more<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
people but this is really more of a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
people but this is really more of a
two-person<00:01:01.080> boat<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.800> meant<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:02.100> two

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
two-person boat really meant for two

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
two-person boat really meant for two
people<00:01:02.760> okay<00:01:03.240> MB<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.290> 310<00:01:04.890> might<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:05.640> or

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
people okay MB the 310 might be three or

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.830 
people okay MB the 310 might be three or
four<00:01:05.790> people<00:01:06.119> correct

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
four people correct

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
four people correct
okay<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.280> normally<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.970> talk

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
okay you know normally when we talk

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.480 
okay you know normally when we talk
about<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.600> many<00:01:09.780> people<00:01:10.290> abode<00:01:10.710> holds<00:01:11.189> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
about how many people abode holds it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
about how many people abode holds it's
the<00:01:11.700> Coast<00:01:11.939> Guard<00:01:12.180> maximum<00:01:12.720> rating<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the Coast Guard maximum rating but you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
the Coast Guard maximum rating but you
end<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.619> having<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.979> knees<00:01:14.159> touching<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
end up having your knees touching and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
end up having your knees touching and
you<00:01:15.749> know<00:01:15.869> bigger<00:01:16.229> boats<00:01:16.530> give<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.280> much

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you know bigger boats give you that much

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.489 
you know bigger boats give you that much
more<00:01:17.670> room<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> inevitably<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.079> perform

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
more room and inevitably they perform

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.370 
more room and inevitably they perform
better<00:01:19.679> so<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.579> 275<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.450> fantastic<00:01:22.109> and<00:01:22.229> it's

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
better so the 275 is fantastic and it's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
better so the 275 is fantastic and it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.360 
we're going to see that can get up on a
plane<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.709> take<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> longest

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
plane so it's going to take the longest

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.010 
plane so it's going to take the longest
time<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.120> got<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.420> little<00:02:14.569> 8<00:02:14.780> horse

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
time and it's got the little 8 horse

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:24.840 
time and it's got the little 8 horse
mercury<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.340> let's<00:02:16.520> give<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.819> try

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.290 

probably<00:02:25.570> about<00:02:25.660> 10<00:02:26.050> seconds<00:02:26.530> or<00:02:26.650> so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
probably about 10 seconds or so

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.060 
probably about 10 seconds or so
not<00:02:28.840> bad

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.949
