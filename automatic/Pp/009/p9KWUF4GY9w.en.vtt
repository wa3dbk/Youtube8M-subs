way<00:01:33.950> what<00:01:34.950> did<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.909> deal

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
way what did you think about this deal

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.950 
way what did you think about this deal
between<00:01:36.420> musk<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.290> Governor<00:01:37.770> Cuomo

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
between musk and Governor Cuomo

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.940 
between musk and Governor Cuomo
yeah<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> new<00:01:40.259> york<00:01:40.439> deal<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.740> pretty

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
yeah the new york deal is pretty

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.700 
yeah the new york deal is pretty
interesting<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:43.110> creates<00:01:43.560> an

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
interesting because it really creates an

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
interesting because it really creates an
exception<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.610> tesla<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.869> continue<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
exception for tesla to continue the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
exception for tesla to continue the
stores<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.360> said<00:01:48.509> they

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
stores that they have as you said they

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
stores that they have as you said they
can<00:01:48.869> add<00:01:49.020> stores<00:01:49.350> later<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.860> through<00:01:50.460> dealers

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
can add stores later but through dealers

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.300 
can add stores later but through dealers
and<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.290> sort<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.649> from<00:01:52.920> now<00:01:52.950> on

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and so it's sort of like from now on

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
and so it's sort of like from now on
everybody<00:01:54.180> has<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.570> dealers<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> doesn't

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
everybody has to use dealers it doesn't

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
everybody has to use dealers it doesn't
really<00:01:55.500> create<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.860> precedent<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.729> next

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
really create a precedent for the next

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.910 
really create a precedent for the next
electric<00:01:57.390> car<00:01:57.600> maker<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:58.290> probably<00:01:58.740> more

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
electric car maker or probably more

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920 
electric car maker or probably more
importantly<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> chinese<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.540> an<00:02:00.630> indian

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
importantly for a chinese or an indian

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.410 
importantly for a chinese or an indian
brand<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.710> come<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.340> bypass<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.149> dealers

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

all<00:02:03.630> together

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
all together

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
all together
at<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> same<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.280> interesting

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
at the same time it's interesting

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.370 
at the same time it's interesting
because<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.780> provides<00:02:07.200> some

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
because it's it provides some

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.440 
because it's it provides some

you put up that map and as long as the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
states are kind of a patch

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.030 
states are kind of a patch
work<00:02:13.480> especially<00:02:14.320> where<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.620> states<00:02:14.890> are

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
work especially where the states are

well yeah if you know this this thing is
is<00:03:40.720> really<00:03:41.019> unprecedented<00:03:41.380> it's<00:03:41.980> sort<00:03:42.220> of

is really unprecedented it's sort of
this<00:03:42.820> whole<00:03:43.060> gigafactory<00:03:43.600> idea<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.620> you

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
this whole gigafactory idea is is you

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.740 
this whole gigafactory idea is is you
know<00:03:44.980> Elon<00:03:45.400> Musk<00:03:45.700> not<00:03:45.910> trying<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.330> just<00:03:46.510> be<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
know Elon Musk not trying to just be the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
know Elon Musk not trying to just be the
Henry<00:03:47.050> Ford<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.470> electric<00:03:47.860> cars<00:03:48.100> but<00:03:48.700> a

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
Henry Ford of electric cars but a

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.820 
Henry Ford of electric cars but a
battery<00:03:49.269> cars<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.959> batteries<00:03:50.470> themselves

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
battery cars but a batteries themselves

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.130 
battery cars but a batteries themselves
you<00:03:51.610> know<00:03:51.670> would<00:03:51.850> more<00:03:52.090> than<00:03:52.120> double<00:03:52.269> it's

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
you know would more than double it's

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.449 
you know would more than double it's
just<00:03:53.350> hard<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.530> really<00:03:53.739> conceive<00:03:54.130> of<00:03:54.160> one

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
just hard to really conceive of one

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.030 
just hard to really conceive of one
factory<00:03:54.910> doubling<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.019> global<00:03:56.320> supply<00:03:56.530> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
factory doubling the global supply of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.759 
factory doubling the global supply of
something<00:03:57.760> that's<00:03:58.090> become<00:03:58.510> as<00:03:58.720> common<00:03:59.380> now<00:03:59.560> as

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
something that's become as common now as

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.800 
something that's become as common now as
lithium-ion<00:04:00.519> batteries<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.269> know<00:04:01.330> we<00:04:01.450> see<00:04:01.720> in

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
lithium-ion batteries you know we see in

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.400 
lithium-ion batteries you know we see in
mineralogical

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
mineralogical

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.900 
mineralogical
and<00:04:02.530> almost<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.070> seems<00:04:03.340> like<00:04:03.400> most<00:04:03.670> cars

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
and almost you know seems like most cars

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.430 
and almost you know seems like most cars
these<00:04:04.120> days<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.360> lot<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.840> new<00:04:04.930> cars<00:04:05.140> come<00:04:05.350> out

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
these days a lot of new cars come out

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.380 
these days a lot of new cars come out
with<00:04:05.590> them<00:04:05.709> for<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.220> stop-start<00:04:06.730> power<00:04:07.000> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
with them for the stop-start power and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.120 
with them for the stop-start power and
just<00:04:07.750> because<00:04:07.989> they're<00:04:08.170> powerful<00:04:08.530> batteries

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
just because they're powerful batteries

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.979 
just because they're powerful batteries
that<00:04:09.280> are<00:04:09.400> used<00:04:09.549> in<00:04:09.700> lots<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.060> ways

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
that are used in lots of ways

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.320 
that are used in lots of ways
yeah<00:04:11.440> so<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:12.250> really<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.299> really

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
yeah so that really is a it's it really

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.030 
yeah so that really is a it's it really
means<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.900> lot<00:04:13.930> for<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.350> investment<00:04:14.799> for<00:04:14.920> the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
means a lot for the investment for the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.509 
means a lot for the investment for the
jobs

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
jobs

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.789 
jobs
it's<00:04:15.820> influences<00:04:16.450> on<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> state<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:17.470> know<00:04:17.590> so

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
it's influences on the state you know so

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.590 
it's influences on the state you know so
the<00:04:17.919> intelligent<00:04:18.459> supply<00:04:18.729> chain<00:04:19.000> but<00:04:19.390> do<00:04:19.510> you

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
the intelligent supply chain but do you

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.370 
the intelligent supply chain but do you
think<00:04:19.810> he<00:04:19.930> can<00:04:20.080> do<00:04:20.290> it<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:21.930> know<00:04:22.930> who<00:04:23.200> knows

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
think he can do it you know who knows

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.960 
think he can do it you know who knows
that<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.650> know<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.370> companies<00:04:24.760> we've

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
that you know the this companies we've

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.120 
that you know the this companies we've
talked<00:04:25.180> about<00:04:25.330> over<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.050> last<00:04:26.470> year<00:04:26.770> or<00:04:26.800> two

talked about over the last year or two

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.940 
talked about over the last year or two
they<00:04:27.520> face<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.120> many<00:04:28.360> unbelievable<00:04:28.950> obstacles

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
they face so many unbelievable obstacles

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.230 
they face so many unbelievable obstacles
you<00:04:30.130> know<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:30.310> you'd<00:04:30.430> asked<00:04:30.610> me<00:04:30.760> two<00:04:30.970> years<00:04:31.000> ago

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
you know if you'd asked me two years ago

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.680 
you know if you'd asked me two years ago
could<00:04:32.020> they<00:04:32.200> sell<00:04:32.580> 20,000<00:04:33.580> cars<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.090> keep

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
could they sell 20,000 cars and keep

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.660 
could they sell 20,000 cars and keep
growing<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.350> expanding<00:04:35.650> Europe<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.250> China<00:04:36.280> I

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
growing and expanding Europe and China I

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.890 
growing and expanding Europe and China I
would<00:04:36.760> not<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.300> thought<00:04:37.480> they<00:04:37.660> could<00:04:37.810> have

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
would not have thought they could have
