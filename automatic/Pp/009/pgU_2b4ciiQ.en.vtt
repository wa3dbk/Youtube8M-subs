00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:13.510
Hi, I'm Valerie Waters, with the A-List Look.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.919
And today, I have Fab Abs and Bikini Thighs
Workout.

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:18.919
And you're gonna love it.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.669
And this is perfect for the summer, because,
well, we're gonna make your abs fabulous -- we're

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.160
gonna tighten and tone them.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.550
And we're gonna lose that jiggle on the inner
thigh.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.400
So if you're ready, let's get started.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.960
Okay, this workout is so fun -- all you need
are your Valslides and a playground ball.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.640
So our first exercise is a Plie Squat, which
is just body weight.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.270
You're gonna take a nice wide stanch, with
your toes turned out.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.700
Abs are tight.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.700
I'm going down.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.580
I'm gonna push through my heels, squeeze my
butt on the way up.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.710
We're doing 20 reps.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.680
That's 2.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680
And 3.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.680
And 4.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.300
Now, if you're really strong and you wanna
develop your inner thighs a little bit more,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.600
then absolutely use a weight.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.810
I, right now, don't feel that I need it -- especially
because I know what's coming, so I am doing

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.229
body weight only.

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130
But if you want a little extra, grab a kettle
bell or a dumbbell.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.280
And squeeze.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.929
And we're almost there.

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.530
Last 4.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.760
Good.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.280
One more.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.280
And that is perfect.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.549
And now you're gonna grab your Valslide.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.320
Using my new pink Valslides, put your whole
foot on.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.340
We're gonna go Side Lunge with a Pulse.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.310
So we're gonna start with 10 side lunges.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.719
So I'm sitting back in my glute, and I'm sliding
that leg out to the side.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.149
That's perfect.

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.149
5.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.320
Now, we really wanna work that outside edge
-- that's how you get a little more inner

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
thigh.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.490
And that's 8.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.299
Good, you're doing great.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.299
9.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.579
Take it nice and low.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.579
And that's 10.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.249
Now, I'm gonna hold it there and I'm gonna
pulse for 10.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.829
So I'm pulling in my inner thigh.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.079
You may feel this leg burning as well.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.709
Again, squeeze in with that inner thigh.

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:05.709
Almost there.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:06.709
One more.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.200
Excellent, way to go.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.485
Put your foot on the other side -- we don't
rest, we go right into it.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:12.485
That's 1.

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:13.680
And 2.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.310
Remember, you're going nice and slow and controlled.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.790
If you are a beginner with the Valslides,
you can put a chair in front of you -- use

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.790
that for a balance.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.150
If you don't have Valslides, try a towel on
the wood floors, or get some Valslides.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.349
Okay, that was 10.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.180
Hold and pulse.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.790
And pulse, and squeeze in with that inner
thigh.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.640
No more jiggle this summer.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.750
Gotta get it done.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.019
Okay, almost there.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.019
And 10.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.019
That was so good.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.600
Alright, we're going right into Ball Squats.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.629
So this is just playground ball.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.750
Kids probably have one, you can get them almost
anywhere.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.300
Put it right there, just above your knees.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.800
We're going 20 squats.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.519
Down, and that's 2.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.799
So what I'm doing here is I'm keeping tension
on that ball.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.310
I have the ball -- it doesn't have too much
air in it, so I can really squeeze, which

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.050
is activating my inner thigh.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.050
Good.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.909
So still keep your squat nice and low.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.099
Chest up.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.700
Good, we're about halfway.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.750
Going all the way to 20.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.170
It's bikini season, don't quit on me.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.060
Okay, 4 more.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.329
3 more.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.220
And last one.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.440
Oh, that is so good.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.030
I'm putting that down.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.269
And I'm going Upside Down Snow Angel.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.620
So this one's gonna work your inner thigh
and your core -- a lot of core.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.400
Come down to a push-up position with your
Valslides, feet in the middle.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.109
Okay, strong abs.

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.150
Open and close.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.980
Going to 20.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.819
2, 3, 6.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.510
I get quiet on the hard ones.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.069
10.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.720
Keep squeezing those inner thighs.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.720
Good.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720
15.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720
Two more.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.040
One more.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.349
Oh god, that was so good.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.879
Okay, now I'm gonna lie on my back again.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.380
Or, not again -- I'm gonna use the ball again,
is what I meant to say.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.850
I'm gonna do a Ball Bridge.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.220
I'm gonna put that between my knees, lying
down.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.080
I'm gonna squeeze up because I'm working my
butt, but I'm keeping tension on that ball.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.720
So I'm working my inner thigh, because I'm
keeping that tension.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.360
That's 4.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.750
That's 5.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.070
Good.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.479
My bun is in the way.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.540
Okay, see how fun this is?

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.540
Good.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.540
That's 10.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.669
Now, hold at the top and squeeze for 20.

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.970
So I'm pulsing, pulsing, pulsing.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.360
You're so gonna feel your inner thigh burn
on this one.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360
9, 10.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
Ten more.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.880
Squeeze, keep your hips up.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.970
Don't let them drop.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.970
Almost there.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.700
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.560
Now, we don't move the ball yet.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.960
We're going Ball Clams, so keep the ball there.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.940
Hands go behind your head, and you squeeze
that down and in.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.090
So it's like a reverse crunch at the same
time.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.520
So I'm working abs and inner thigh.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.370
Okay, that's 7.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.460
Good, keep going.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.180
Going to 20, make them count.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.960
Make sure those shoulders come up off the
ground.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.460
Stretching way in.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.270
Good, five more.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.370
Here we go.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.130
Bring it home.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.130
One more.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.430
Okay, great job.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.479
That is round one of Fab Abs and Bikini Thighs.

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.990
And I don't know about you, but I feel my
thighs and my abs are totally worked.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.270
I want you to take a quick break, and then
we are gonna repeat this round two more times.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.819
It's gonna be tough, but you're gonna thank
me later.

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:26.830
I'm Valerie Waters -- and remember, you are
just one workout away from a good mood.
