years later I realized that the doctrine
of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> Trinity<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> Magnificent<00:00:51.840> truth

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that God is community Father Son and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
that God is community Father Son and
Holy<00:00:55.440> Spirit<00:00:55.800> God<00:00:56.730> has<00:00:56.879> never<00:00:57.120> been<00:00:57.329> an

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
Holy Spirit God has never been an

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
individual he's always been a family and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110 
individual he's always been a family and
