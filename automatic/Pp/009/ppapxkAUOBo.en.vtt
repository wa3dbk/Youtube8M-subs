00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
insulated here this uses the relay and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
insulated here this uses the relay and
some<00:01:17.400> circuit<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:22.159> see

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.740

knife so there really is kind of
annoying<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.670> can<00:02:00.819> even<00:02:00.970> see<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> indication

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
