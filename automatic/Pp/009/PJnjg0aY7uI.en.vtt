00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.069
 I putty about it so the ceiling on 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.940
 corners I have not touched it their traction 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.040
 putty as it makes here explain 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.450
 I take any putty add a small 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.500
 quantity there 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.390
 DJ bitch Turks stir it all up and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.189
 I make the solution and the solution I have here is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 here turned gray but when 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.380
 invest in walls make them 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.899
 rub on flat against that wall by 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 us uga it turns out stupid either sharp and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.100
 when 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.969
 having here's such an angular spatula on 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.500
 has 90 degrees and when we pull out 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.550
 this corner putty anyway we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.590
 sleeves so here goes and wall at the expense of with 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 we don't care anyway 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 Here, too, the curve is made and this is a spatula 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.890
 the corner we still go we don't 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.299
 notice on per mission then when 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 sticking wallpaper in one place you can even this 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.450
 tense battle already pierced in another 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.729
 place he even attach to it 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 you touch him and this place is solid but 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.000
 so that these angles are not needed 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.780
 do just vertical and we are without 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.439
 every worm how to do it like this 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.430
 look here i will attach one this one 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.189
 you made the wall from the tent and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.220
 another wall will tell about the acute angle 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 me to the spatula 90 degrees if 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.829
 here we put these two plates 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.020
 touches here these walls and we drag up 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.390
 or down, that is, we can do it like this 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.259
 we can do that, that is, we have a movement 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 spatula and so and so changing that is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.810
 the corner is made uneven although plastered 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.689
 all rolls 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.020
 ideally show all 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.090
 here we have a corner stupid then a spatula we 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.519
 heads multiplier over man friend not 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.239
 concerns either in that way i have 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.959
 two spatulas 190 degrees and the other dumber 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.480
 obtuse angle 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.780
 done that is to say this plate i like 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 I would unbend very much to me 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.980
 this angle does not touch this angle so that 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.510
 there was such an isthmus there solution 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.780
 I put the main thing here 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.269
 these two records touched these walls 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.010
 that's how i do it i'll show you this 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.500
 I started doing something with me 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.140
 Ural course uneven it consists of two 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.360
 parts because there need a lot 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.019
 mortar to lay so take this one 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.019
 just take a look about 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.600
 I put a solution let's say any subject 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.190
 even longer if you are on the straight wall we 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.820
 Of course, this spatula applies and 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 he touches me with two plates 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:39.410
 wall edges so apply 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.720
 necessarily weighed and nailed 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.720
 this even any subject any 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:56.250
 Now I put up a spatula and hold on 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.360
 it is the river that is not what the groans arena 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.360
 there is starting to pull 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.030
 and here I have a corner 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:15.510
 accordingly a huge smooth 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:18.450
 perfect just perfect more 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.250
 I will not touch anything that is here at all 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.250
 of course the curve but so here is his water
