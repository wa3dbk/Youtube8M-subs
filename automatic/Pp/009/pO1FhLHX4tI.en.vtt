00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 Siegfried 62 wongfried in front of you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 is with me in the computer siegfried and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:26.849
 nora what is still where i speak 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.929
 I do not ask all the people that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.929
 So you can believe you can continue 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 why are you calling to the topic of what 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.379
 Is your unbelievable there dear domian 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.129
 you're an alien drink and 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.640
 Extraterrestrials also have before and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.640
 last name 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 i have 32 years of which planet 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.239
 Will you arrive one day with me? 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 a few hours visit comes and then 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 Do not you have any doubt these things too 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.770
 answer all that is a question that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270
 that would blow up the frame 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.740
 That's an obvious question if 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.560
 you take one from me, I'm from another 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.090
 universe belongs but there is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.680
 not just one and we will but 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 There are 58,000 universe so called 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 woo 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.549
 okay, because of that even high-quality 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 astrophysicists assume that we have several 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.509
 that maybe we are a box 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.590
 in different universes yes there 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.369
 are you from another universe? 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.920
 how did you get here ? 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.290
 but as thought as cool would be over here 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.590
 transported a spaceship on 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.869
 this gentleman siegfried before 32 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.729
 years and he was prepared and saying 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.970
 we so he was the best prepared 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.820
 human to quasi rescue this earth where 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.939
 is this former earth human? 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.439
 sees siegfried nora but that is yes 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.880
 not you, you only have that 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.880
 body taken from these people 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.910
 Naturally 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.920
 how should I say so after the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.690
 hours and he was now 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.180
 earlier so prepared in the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.590
 the direction of whom he was preparing that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.740
 would happen that he was 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.460
 intelligent he has many craft trades 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.810
 he was computer expert yes okay okay well 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.240
 nice but then you are in these 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.970
 human driven purely as a ghost 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.620
 are important lorin body why 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.650
 took about seven minutes 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.450
 Also Klima Fleet was so big and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 powerful that the so seven minutes 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.380
 Of course, I ask myself now 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.860
 what this being from this distant 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.160
 other universe what do you want here 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.200
 I also want a good question slowly 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.100
 to answer who did anyone 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.210
 excited 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.280
 where it is not about how elegant world 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.540
 experienced one in no time 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.510
 huge turn 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.420
 I hope a good but only a good one 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.480
 that's good h the overall negativity 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.540
 will prepare here 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.940
 yes and what is left then 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.790
 paradise on earth or exactly what 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.970
 Look, the case was 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.520
 good news is not and thousands 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.650
 somewhere that we thought so 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.050
 that he will come like that 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 belongs to Baden and so far so I have 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.370
 no other he had known before 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.080
 As I said, I was prepared as 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.239
 the soul can but I did not know 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.160
 really so I'll always times times 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.720
 so but I am yes I'm only one 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.350
 expedient or not any are therefore 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.620

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:30.350
 the nasa and they would have to see that 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.540

 is there among the mighty on the 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:06.110
 world so you could tell that not even 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.140
 ten of which there is one of you

 that may not sound like that, though 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.029
 Maybe yes we should believe so 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.270
 that we smock and 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:27.149

 you are with but every single person 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:36.300
 a powerful god an unimaginable 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.889
 god only it steals no one will not 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.219
 he also has the power to believe 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.689
 but people are changing 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.789
 in record two thousands of years 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:49.770
 not why should they but the 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:55.199
 We know the past 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.599
 know but i believe for example that 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.409
 we the third rich and 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.080
 National Socialism in communism 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.240
 not doubt cable should unfortunately 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.339
 and if we were not careful or 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.009
 when Wilander belt-brothers would 

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:09.569
 would save you and everyone 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.809
 then the third world war would happen 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.550
 why access why why if you are 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:18.110
 So good-time why do you have something like that 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.110
 as Hitler and Stalin admitted 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:27.149

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.659
