00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 a little tutorial from me or 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 stargate 12 on windows vista and 7 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.410
 let run 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.639
 i know it could be windows 8 on it 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 but not as another problem-a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 game starts you have graphic error that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.550
 water is black the opponents are 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 Black in the water are just white 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 or black spots are on the grass 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 orange spots do not know anything 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.349
 Possible looks in any case not good 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.290
 that's why I thought so yes I have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.120
 ever a tutorial in English 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.530
 seen not in German I know 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.329
 not if that's what I do 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.910
 just maybe around you with it 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.840
 also to help a bit and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 Although it actually all went on 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 explorer ex I have that now 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.680
 made smaller down there that the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.730
 full version if anyone asks and the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.199
 First, just have a look at the taskmanager 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.760
 Of course, you have to stay here like me 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.809
 age of empires start that here 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.420
 in it is then he goes on percent 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.729
 then processes on explorer exe then 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 process finished process they finish 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.090
 the 2 so that you can 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.580
 make everything again afterwards 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.390
 then double-click on it to pay mps 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.740
 so far in the game 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.380
 The graphic errors are now 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.240
 gone that's just why 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.759
 I do not know exactly because of that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.439
 explorer probably because of somehow 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.939
 the design can be a red or something 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.610
 But you also turn off, I do not know 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.630
 why definitely work though 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.310
 Now you can now, for example 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.960
 when you're finished you're not bothered 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.030
 no more time has ended then that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.530
 play quite normally 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.799
 it could be that it looks like that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 when he comes back then you click here 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.430
 and next to here again 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.750
 Restore enlarge 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.380
 then age of empires 2're on 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 normal case no longer in there so then 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.290
 is he going back to new task there 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.600
 easy explorer one without complex 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.860
 just explorer presses okay like that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.160
 after that, the task manager can quit and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.830
 everything is back as it is before but so 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.600
 simple is the only disadvantage must 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.170
 is every time really every time 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.830
 if you start the game but there are 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.310
 Also a code like this 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.080
 The ta skill here looks like the died 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.260
 to the explorer and that should be somehow 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.490
 age on a few start when you're done 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.560
 it should be an explorer again 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.570
 However, this starts at 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.860
 I do not have the choir organ behind me 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.390
 I also copied the forum forum 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.620
 again looked at the 15 now 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.760
 maybe not work for you 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.290
 I will write it once the description 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.690
 and then you have to stop that as 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.950
 Save as if you do that too 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.880
 just want to do it if you do that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.880
 For example, you simply want to enter 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 not correct 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.020
 all files can save impression 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.680
 that can close your text documents 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.610
 or close a text document 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.610
 then you have the butt here 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.460
 supposedly it should work for me 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.940
 have ended shortly because I feel 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.440
 here again how it works 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.210
 I do not know why it is not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.030
 idea 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.340
 Well, you have to do that yourself 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.780
 find out then you have that was so 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.600
 an ugly symbol you can do here 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.180
 also change with properties 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.180
 where was that extended 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.600
 somehow you can still use the symbol 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.290
 I do not know yet how to change it 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.560
 bad 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.000
 In any case I do not know how to 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.380
 can definitely change it then pulls 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.400
 therefore quite normal as this one 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:10.620
 probably without the administrator 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.000
 right open fucking sign as it comes 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.430
 In any case, this is about designed 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.620
 normal play and now I hope that at 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.280
 you also works and have fun with it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.750
 the game 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.220
 thanks for watching i hope it has 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.220
 helped until next time
