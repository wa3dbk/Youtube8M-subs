swen asked us to do the Lego toe motor
that<00:00:15.549> was<00:00:15.639> featured<00:00:16.000> in<00:00:16.059> our<00:00:16.240> jam<00:00:16.450> factory<00:00:16.660> and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
that was featured in our jam factory and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.840 
that was featured in our jam factory and
of<00:00:17.619> course<00:00:17.860> we<00:00:17.980> have<00:00:18.100> no<00:00:18.220> problem<00:00:18.550> doing<00:00:18.730> that

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
of course we have no problem doing that

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.849 
of course we have no problem doing that
so<00:00:19.270> and<00:00:19.600> here<00:00:19.930> it<00:00:20.020> is<00:00:20.080> let's<00:00:20.350> first<00:00:20.619> take<00:00:20.800> a

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
so and here it is let's first take a

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.160 
so and here it is let's first take a
look<00:00:21.099> at<00:00:21.250> it<00:00:21.400> and<00:00:21.970> take<00:00:22.269> Riley<00:00:22.630> out<00:00:22.810> really

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
look at it and take Riley out really

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.189 
look at it and take Riley out really
quick<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:28.269> this<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.509> try<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.779> make<00:00:28.929> it<00:00:29.080> as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
quick but this I try to make it as

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.100 
quick but this I try to make it as
compact<00:00:29.800> as<00:00:30.009> possible<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.570> course<00:00:31.839> always

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
compact as possible and of course always

sleek looking and somewhat like a real

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.200 
sleek looking and somewhat like a real
toe<00:00:34.750> motor<00:00:35.020> I<00:00:35.260> have<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.220> propane<00:00:36.670> tank<00:00:36.969> in<00:00:37.120> the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
toe motor I have the propane tank in the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.479 
toe motor I have the propane tank in the
back<00:00:37.390> there<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.020> little<00:00:38.710> emergency<00:00:38.950> light

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489

back there and a little emergency light
and<00:00:39.789> of<00:00:39.879> course<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:41.620> works<00:00:41.980> but<00:00:42.820> I'm<00:00:42.910> going

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
and of course this works but I'm going

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.220 
and of course this works but I'm going
to<00:00:43.059> go<00:00:43.149> ahead<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.510> break<00:00:43.629> down<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.930> parts

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
to go ahead and break down the parts

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.069 
to go ahead and break down the parts
list<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.739> then<00:00:44.890> show<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.160> how<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.370> build<00:00:45.520> it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
list and then show you how to build it

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.720 
list and then show you how to build it
all<00:00:47.079> right<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.410> here's<00:00:47.590> our<00:00:47.710> parts<00:00:48.100> list<00:00:48.370> it's

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
all right so here's our parts list it's

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.200 
all right so here's our parts list it's
a<00:00:48.820> lot<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.210> yellow<00:00:49.600> plates<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.289> a<00:00:50.350> lot<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.559> big

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.880 
part here and the reason I put it so far
back<00:02:00.969> in<00:02:01.240> there<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.659> because<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.500> try<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.710> make

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
back in there is because to try to make

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.190 
back in there is because to try to make
this<00:02:03.070> toe<00:02:03.579> motor<00:02:03.759> as<00:02:03.909> compact<00:02:04.450> as<00:02:04.659> possible

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
this toe motor as compact as possible

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.480 
this toe motor as compact as possible
because<00:02:05.350> Tom<00:02:05.649> wanted<00:02:05.890> in<00:02:05.979> real<00:02:06.130> life<00:02:06.340> are

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
because Tom wanted in real life are

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.749 
because Tom wanted in real life are
really<00:02:06.670> small<00:02:07.289> then<00:02:08.289> we<00:02:08.380> take<00:02:08.619> our<00:02:08.830> 1<00:02:09.580> by

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
really small then we take our 1 by

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.630 
really small then we take our 1 by
threes<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.810> course<00:02:11.080> go<00:02:11.920> ahead<00:02:11.950> put<00:02:12.520> them

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
threes and of course go ahead put them

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.880 
threes and of course go ahead put them
on

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.230 
on
there<00:02:13.090> we're<00:02:14.090> also<00:02:14.240> going<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.569> put<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:16.000> 2<00:02:17.000> by<00:02:17.180> 2

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
there we're also going to put a 2 by 2

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.740 
there we're also going to put a 2 by 2
and<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.200> 1<00:02:18.440> by<00:02:18.620> 2<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.850> then<00:02:20.270> we're<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.600> do

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and a 1 by 2 and then we're going to do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.610 
and a 1 by 2 and then we're going to do
another<00:02:21.500> 1<00:02:22.160> by<00:02:22.340> 3<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:22.970> each<00:02:23.209> side<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.410> looks

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
another 1 by 3 on each side so it looks

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.430 
another 1 by 3 on each side so it looks
kind<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:26.810> immediately

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
kind of like that and then immediately

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.410 
kind of like that and then immediately
we're<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.740> throw<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.160> our<00:02:28.370> back<00:02:28.670> bracket

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
we're going to throw on our back bracket

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.110 
we're going to throw on our back bracket
and<00:02:29.570> that's<00:02:30.020> going<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.260> make<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:31.120> basically

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and that's going to make it basically

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.630 
and that's going to make it basically
sit<00:02:32.690> very<00:02:32.900> low<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.530> ground<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.100> that's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
sit very low to the ground and that's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370 
sit very low to the ground and that's
once<00:02:34.910> again<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.240> make<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.660> whole<00:02:35.840> compact

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
once again to make it that whole compact

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.540 
once again to make it that whole compact
thing<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.830> everything<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.170> then<00:02:39.530> I'm<00:02:40.489> going

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
thing and everything so then I'm going

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.210 
thing and everything so then I'm going
to<00:02:40.700> do<00:02:40.790> another<00:02:40.970> 2<00:02:41.330> by<00:02:41.510> 2<00:02:41.739> right<00:02:42.739> here<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.069> make

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
to do another 2 by 2 right here to make

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.130 
to do another 2 by 2 right here to make
that<00:02:43.459> even<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.239> then<00:02:44.690> we're<00:02:44.780> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.930> go

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
that even and then we're going to go

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.530 
that even and then we're going to go
ahead<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.860> build<00:02:46.040> up<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.430> sides<00:02:46.730> oops<00:02:47.120> break

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
ahead and build up the sides oops break

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.509 
ahead and build up the sides oops break
fell<00:02:47.900> off<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.620> then<00:02:52.130> we're<00:02:52.220> going<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> go

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
fell off and then we're going to go

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.860 
fell off and then we're going to go
ahead<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.940> put<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.330> 1<00:02:54.080> by<00:02:54.260> 3<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:56.209> 1<00:02:56.360> by<00:02:56.420> 4

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
ahead and put the 1 by 3 and the 1 by 4

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.860 
ahead and put the 1 by 3 and the 1 by 4
is<00:02:56.989> together<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:59.090> then<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.269> course<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.720> make

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
is together and then of course to make

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.820 
is together and then of course to make
them<00:03:00.110> stronger<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.400> want<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:02.830> basically

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
them stronger you want to basically

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.890 
them stronger you want to basically
stagger<00:03:04.519> them<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.910> know<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.090> put<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.390> 1<00:03:05.540> by<00:03:05.660> 3

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
stagger them you know you put the 1 by 3

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.720 
stagger them you know you put the 1 by 3
on<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:06.200> side<00:03:06.260> then<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.130> want<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.310> put<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.550> 1

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
on this side then you want to put the 1

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.509 
on this side then you want to put the 1
by<00:03:07.850> 4<00:03:08.090> overlapping<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.950> know<00:03:10.070> making<00:03:10.310> it

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
by 4 overlapping that you know making it

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.660 
by 4 overlapping that you know making it
a<00:03:10.640> stronger<00:03:11.330> build<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.870> vice<00:03:12.410> versa<00:03:13.070> for<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
a stronger build and vice versa for the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.930 
a stronger build and vice versa for the
other<00:03:13.850> side<00:03:14.860> all<00:03:15.860> right<00:03:16.040> put<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.310> bracket

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
other side all right put that bracket

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.330 
other side all right put that bracket
back<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:20.090> we'll<00:03:20.239> go<00:03:20.360> ahead<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.340> now

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
back on and then we'll go ahead and now

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.920 
back on and then we'll go ahead and now
that<00:03:22.579> it's<00:03:22.730> looking<00:03:23.030> kind<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.810> we

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
that it's looking kind of like that we

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.170 
that it's looking kind of like that we
still<00:03:23.989> have<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.410> even<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.829> out<00:03:24.950> there<00:03:25.280> another

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
still have to even it out there another

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.940 
still have to even it out there another
2<00:03:26.480> by<00:03:26.630> 2<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.840> 1<00:03:27.170> by<00:03:27.200> 2<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:29.540> like<00:03:29.810> so

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
2 by 2 and 1 by 2 on there like so

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.590 
2 by 2 and 1 by 2 on there like so
and<00:03:31.040> then<00:03:31.670> we're<00:03:31.760> going<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:31.910> go<00:03:32.060> ahead<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.420> put

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
and then we're going to go ahead and put

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.750 
and then we're going to go ahead and put
our<00:03:32.630> flat<00:03:33.260> tiles<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.769> 1<00:03:36.980> by<00:03:37.130> 6<00:03:37.459> right<00:03:37.730> there

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
our flat tiles the 1 by 6 right there

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.800 
our flat tiles the 1 by 6 right there
and<00:03:38.299> then<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.140> 1<00:03:39.320> by<00:03:39.470> 1<00:03:39.650> right<00:03:39.860> up<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.190> top<00:03:40.430> and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
and then the 1 by 1 right up on top and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.500 
and then the 1 by 1 right up on top and
then<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.110> same<00:03:42.380> except<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.340> do<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.150> that

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
then the same except I do that like that

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.780 
then the same except I do that like that
because<00:03:45.500> then<00:03:45.650> I'm<00:03:45.769> going<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.980> run<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.400> 1<00:03:47.000> by<00:03:47.150> 2

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
because then I'm going to run a 1 by 2

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.490 
because then I'm going to run a 1 by 2
this<00:03:49.790> way<00:03:50.060> across<00:03:50.510> as<00:03:50.720> soon<00:03:50.870> as<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.019> finish<00:03:51.260> that

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
this way across as soon as I finish that

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.560 
this way across as soon as I finish that
but<00:03:52.070> first<00:03:52.579> we<00:03:52.760> have<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.030> go<00:03:53.150> ahead<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.480> this

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
but first we have to go ahead and this

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.449 
but first we have to go ahead and this
is<00:03:53.780> what<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.350> funky<00:03:54.829> piece<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.220> for

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
is what this that funky piece is for

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.900 
is what this that funky piece is for
there<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.810> for<00:03:57.170> our<00:03:57.579> propane<00:03:58.579> tank

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
there and this is for our propane tank

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.370 
there and this is for our propane tank
that<00:03:59.209> goes<00:03:59.329> on<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.600> back<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.019> tow<00:04:00.170> motor

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
that goes on the back of the tow motor

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.130 
that goes on the back of the tow motor
so<00:04:01.010> it's<00:04:01.160> nice<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.400> even<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.269> then<00:04:02.329> we<00:04:02.930> want

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
so it's nice and even and then we want

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.810 
so it's nice and even and then we want
to<00:04:03.200> go<00:04:03.320> ahead<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.590> throw<00:04:03.860> these<00:04:05.709> curved<00:04:06.820> flat

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
to go ahead and throw these curved flat

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.360 
to go ahead and throw these curved flat
pieces<00:04:08.209> there<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.079> then<00:04:09.950> we're<00:04:10.040> going<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.190> go

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
pieces there and then we're going to go

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.670 
pieces there and then we're going to go
ahead<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:10.850> bring<00:04:11.060> put<00:04:11.329> our<00:04:11.450> last<00:04:12.340> 2<00:04:13.340> by<00:04:13.579> 2

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
ahead and bring put our last 2 by 2

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.979 
ahead and bring put our last 2 by 2
right<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:15.950> back<00:04:16.160> like<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.510> then<00:04:17.690> we<00:04:17.810> can

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
right on the back like so so then we can

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.039 
right on the back like so so then we can
connect<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.269> that<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.660> where

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
connect it like this and that is where

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.510 
connect it like this and that is where
we're<00:04:21.200> going<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.410> put<00:04:21.560> one<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.859> those<00:04:21.950> modified

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
we're going to put one of those modified

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.840 
we're going to put one of those modified
tiles<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.750> can

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
tiles to can

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.920 
tiles to can
the<00:04:25.350> this<00:04:26.350> piece<00:04:26.590> over<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.630> alright<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:28.690> we're

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
the this piece over it alright so we're

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.180 
the this piece over it alright so we're
going<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.080> make<00:04:29.230> our<00:04:29.380> propane<00:04:29.800> tank<00:04:30.040> we're

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
going to make our propane tank we're

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.730 
going to make our propane tank we're
going<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.370> throw<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.790> on<00:04:31.090> there<00:04:31.620> we're<00:04:32.620> going

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
going to throw that on there we're going

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.640 
going to throw that on there we're going
to<00:04:32.800> put<00:04:32.980> this<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.700> side<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:35.350> we're<00:04:35.560> going

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
to put this on this side and we're going

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.130 
to put this on this side and we're going
to<00:04:35.740> go<00:04:35.830> ahead<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.310> smooth<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:36.760> off<00:04:37.140> with

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
to go ahead and just smooth it off with

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
to go ahead and just smooth it off with
these<00:04:38.260> two<00:04:39.420> round<00:04:40.420> one<00:04:40.720> tiles<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.830> are<00:04:41.890> like

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
these two round one tiles that are like

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.200 
these two round one tiles that are like
blueish<00:04:42.490> gray<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.210> also<00:04:43.330> use<00:04:43.720> perhaps

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
blueish gray you can also use perhaps

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.580 
blueish gray you can also use perhaps
somewhat<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.420> little<00:04:46.780> bit<00:04:46.900> better<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.380> look

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
somewhat a little bit better of a look

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.800 
somewhat a little bit better of a look
would<00:04:47.830> be<00:04:48.010> perhaps<00:04:48.310> like<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.850> they<00:04:49.480> have<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
would be perhaps like a they have the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.050 
would be perhaps like a they have the
metallic<00:04:50.200> silver<00:04:50.680> pieces<00:04:51.070> or<00:04:51.550> whatnot<00:04:51.730> if<00:04:51.970> you

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
metallic silver pieces or whatnot if you

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.060 
metallic silver pieces or whatnot if you
can<00:04:52.180> get<00:04:52.300> this<00:04:52.420> all<00:04:52.600> on<00:04:52.630> metallic<00:04:53.140> silver<00:04:53.440> that

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
can get this all on metallic silver that

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.950 
can get this all on metallic silver that
would<00:04:54.250> also<00:04:54.460> look<00:04:54.700> really<00:04:54.760> good<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.360> put<00:04:55.810> this

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
would also look really good I put this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.040 
would also look really good I put this
little<00:04:56.230> thing<00:04:56.530> right<00:04:56.740> back<00:04:57.070> here<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.870> of

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
little thing right back here and then of

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.790 
little thing right back here and then of
course<00:05:00.210> now<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.510> piece<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:01.810> going<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.440> sit

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
course now this piece is going to sit

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.420 
course now this piece is going to sit
over<00:05:03.780> this<00:05:04.780> first<00:05:05.200> one<00:05:05.500> just<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:05.980> even<00:05:06.190> that

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
over this first one just to even that

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.620 
over this first one just to even that
out<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:09.150> then<00:05:10.150> we're<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.450> go

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
out like so and then we're going to go

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
out like so and then we're going to go
ahead<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.320> put<00:05:12.690> these<00:05:13.980> modified<00:05:16.020> tiles<00:05:17.020> on

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
ahead and put these modified tiles on

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.260 
ahead and put these modified tiles on
top<00:05:18.370> like<00:05:18.580> so

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
top like so

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.540 
top like so
I<00:05:19.300> only<00:05:19.600> have<00:05:19.840> one<00:05:20.170> put<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.890> gray<00:05:21.130> one<00:05:21.340> in<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
I only have one put a gray one in the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.930 
I only have one put a gray one in the
back<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.350> then<00:05:23.350> of<00:05:23.530> course<00:05:23.560> our<00:05:24.010> steering

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
back and then of course our steering

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.330 
back and then of course our steering
wheel<00:05:26.070> oops

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
wheel oops

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.470 
wheel oops
you<00:05:27.550> know<00:05:27.640> what<00:05:27.850> this<00:05:28.330> brackets<00:05:28.780> doing

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
you know what this brackets doing

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.910 
you know what this brackets doing
brackets<00:05:31.480> go<00:05:31.540> I<00:05:31.840> actually<00:05:32.140> on<00:05:32.230> the<00:05:32.320> front

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
brackets go I actually on the front

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.390 
brackets go I actually on the front
there<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:34.440> then<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.590> steering<00:05:35.950> wheel<00:05:36.190> goes

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
there and then the steering wheel goes

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.090 
there and then the steering wheel goes
in<00:05:36.640> like<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.480> then<00:05:38.260> we<00:05:38.380> go<00:05:38.500> ahead<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.800> put

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
in like so and then we go ahead and put

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.970 
in like so and then we go ahead and put
these<00:05:39.220> on<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.520> two<00:05:39.700> brackets<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:41.470> then<00:05:41.860> we

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
these on the two brackets and then we

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.020 
these on the two brackets and then we
have<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:44.080> there<00:05:44.260> it<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:45.130> final<00:05:45.460> product

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
have so there it is the final product

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.300 
have so there it is the final product
you<00:05:46.960> know<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.110> tow<00:05:47.440> motor<00:05:47.710> I<00:05:47.800> hope<00:05:48.100> that

I<00:05:55.030> wasn't<00:05:55.360> actually<00:05:55.510> totally<00:05:56.410> thrilled<00:05:56.740> with

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
I wasn't actually totally thrilled with

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.950 
I wasn't actually totally thrilled with
this<00:05:57.070> model<00:05:57.550> I<00:05:57.760> actually<00:05:58.360> wanted<00:05:58.660> to<00:05:58.750> make<00:05:58.840> it

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
this model I actually wanted to make it

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.080 
this model I actually wanted to make it
a<00:05:59.020> little<00:05:59.200> bit<00:05:59.410> smaller<00:05:59.680> there's<00:06:00.250> one<00:06:00.880> on<00:06:01.000> the

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
a little bit smaller there's one on the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.210 
a little bit smaller there's one on the
internet<00:06:01.420> I'll<00:06:01.750> flash<00:06:02.020> a<00:06:02.050> picture<00:06:02.530> they<00:06:03.010> had

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
internet I'll flash a picture they had

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.040 
internet I'll flash a picture they had
just<00:06:03.790> that<00:06:03.940> they<00:06:04.090> used<00:06:04.300> a<00:06:04.420> smaller<00:06:04.750> one<00:06:04.990> of

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
just that they used a smaller one of

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.840 
just that they used a smaller one of
these<00:06:05.290> and<00:06:05.710> I<00:06:05.770> don't<00:06:05.800> even<00:06:06.100> know<00:06:06.280> exactly<00:06:06.760> the

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
these and I don't even know exactly the

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.160 
these and I don't even know exactly the
parts<00:06:07.120> they<00:06:07.270> use<00:06:07.420> but<00:06:07.540> it's<00:06:07.690> a<00:06:07.750> very<00:06:08.050> good

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
parts they use but it's a very good

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.080 
parts they use but it's a very good
design<00:06:08.440> but<00:06:09.070> this<00:06:09.220> in<00:06:09.400> the<00:06:09.490> long<00:06:09.670> run<00:06:09.850> isn't

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
design but this in the long run isn't

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.910 
design but this in the long run isn't
that<00:06:10.390> bad<00:06:10.570> of<00:06:10.600> a<00:06:10.780> design<00:06:11.110> it's<00:06:11.500> pretty<00:06:11.770> good

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
that bad of a design it's pretty good

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.290 
that bad of a design it's pretty good
you<00:06:12.190> know<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.460> definitely<00:06:12.580> looks<00:06:12.910> like<00:06:12.970> a<00:06:13.060> tow

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
motor I definitely captured some things
