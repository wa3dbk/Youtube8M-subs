00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.090
 here is the design of today's bracelets 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.539
 flowered a blade of grass with many 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.640
 little flowers all sbrilluccicose or 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.490
 a string of beaded beads happens to 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.750
 home that maybe they advance and then these 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.100
 little flowers made in peace the le 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.340
 glitter decorations are 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.930
 optional but with really more 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.449
 pretty 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.460
 what to say if you are curious to know how 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.610
 they are very very much realized 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.040
 simple follow the tutorial and if there is 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.739
 like to remember to share it for 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.489
 spread some creativity in the world 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:55.270
 hello the need for the project that 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:58.520
 pisa circular audio 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.680
 if you want tweezers elastic thread line 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:09.020
 a thread that you want baking paper and 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:12.649
 optional glitter iron e 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.209
 if you want you can try the version with 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.719
 the beads are our project 

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:21.740
 we must have this straight line 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.569
 towards us and then we go to get 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.490
 what will be the color we have 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.299
 chosen for our center and it 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.029
 we put 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.939
 right in the core in the center of ours 

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:44.450
 frame around let's build i 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:48.169
 our petals which will be 6 1 2 3 4 5 e 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.229
 6 and then why it must be beautiful right 

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:54.109
 because one will be the leaflet made 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.499
 I will use the green must be nice straight 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.389
 if you start having the frame 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:02.539
 crooked you will notice that it will be a little bit more 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:05.569
 also the coral that you will put on 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.119
 so it will be perfect we see on paper 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.150
 oven and explain 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.680
 you will notice that very few will suffice 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.459
 seconds because ours 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.599
 certainly it is very small and therefore some 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.489
 small and delicate circular movement 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:34.090
 and here in transparency has already dissolved 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:38.139
 we raise we find the frame we turn and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.139
 let's hit the other side too 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.389
 we don't cook too much we don't melt the 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.669
 too much we don't want a flower too 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.299
 flattened but only loose so that 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.299
 be resistant 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.760
 here he is, now that I have all mine 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.269
 decorations decides to put a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.599
 glitter in the midst of each one of them 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.669
 actions this step is optional but 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.870
 makes yours definitely nicer 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:18.530
 decorations chosen the size of mine 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.799
 wrist simply taking the way 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.260
 we do by eye then select the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.090
 my thread a little more abundant 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.419
 because later we will have to make nodes for the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.909
 closing and began to put mine 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:36.919
 petraio I will use the green color for 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:41.409
 simulate the leaves and every 5 pins 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.409
 I'll put on one of my decorations 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.040
 once you have threaded the beads 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.040
 simply close it 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:14.040
 doing a couple of knots over for 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:16.049
 be sure it's done i hope this 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.989
 you like work and if you will 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.989
 I recommend you let me know bye
