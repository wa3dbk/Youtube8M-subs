00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.330
 difficulty choosing all this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 previously in the shade 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.859
 he should be really heavy and also 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.430
 stick hard for high level characters 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.289

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.469
 talentbaum has also acquired 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.430

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.210
 There are raised level limits 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.549
