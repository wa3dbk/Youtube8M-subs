 ae 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.900
 ae 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:19.300
 hi guys today idea gives a hint 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.950
 just a guitar a guitar with the same 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.130
 This is true for any 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:30.840
 rope instrument or fret to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 You're never in a hole. 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:01:05.250
 The main idea is to realize that the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:38.950
 instrument in this way to perceive another 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.329
 tip you can see if the Senate 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:53.100
 also press on the first house on the 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:58.000
 second following the string actually 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.490
 a very but very subtle line has to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.320
 be very subtle if you are over the kitchen 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.819
 very subtle almost slipped into the knot 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.560
 on Wednesday when you press the the 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.910
 stock 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.549
 another tip is to observe here the top here 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.549
 the time when the dengue villain is there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.269
 problem in this part will create a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.930
 belly because of rope tension 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.930
 of the observed safe ropes 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:49.190
 another order tip has none and if 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:03.060
 sometimes in the new one with the drainage 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.459
 with problem at all sure and observe if 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.700
 the rope is too high here because it is 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:14.160
 uncomfortable playing with the color of high 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.910
 high course to download after will stay 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.849
 complicated then the tips 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.049
 I hope it helped you 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.280
 if you are going to buy a new instrument 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.280
 too good
