00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.389
 I was so sensitive to it. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.389
 He likely did not self handagu good. Yeah. So what 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 But I was wondering if there was one thing that I had to say 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 2 hours of dreaming 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 Even when I talked about the main ingredient, I came to my dreams and spoke Aramaic. 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 Stop it. 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.010
 For really about Mr. Hye showed up to look like in my dreams 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.219
 Actually, it appears that there is no action . 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:45.739
 He was looking good. He was looking good. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.739
 What hoejeongdong just between two little hearts English Come goals 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:56.830
 So then I just wanted to break up and feel uncomfortable. 4 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:01:01.030
 Are you burdened with leaving me to do something ? 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.090
 I feel a little bit like this. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 Yes 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.470
 So now I care about my dreams. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.120
 I was in a dream and I was still thinking about towers. 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.960
 It is 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:25.870
 I told you to break up again, but it's easy to see . 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:29.740
 The truth is that the ferns should be separated from the entrance in the first day. 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.400
 Nadeoraguyo hagien nice to define a horse drawn cars 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.360
 When to ask for help 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.170
 So If I've found that doing a character not just a dream that can break up 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.229
 Could it be 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.720
 Oh, it was not that. 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:51.970

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:00.460
 Too 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:05.530
 I thought that I would not be able to handle this myself. 4 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.200
 So I think also distressed for a few days while I pray, and in some ways 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.580
 The answer is 1 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:21.100
 I can not imagine that Hye-jin will meet another person. 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:28.990
 Besides that , I have to be careful of them and I'm the one who lives together. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:34.450
