00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
so here's the finished break um first of

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.030 
so here's the finished break um first of
all<00:00:07.009> we<00:00:07.190> got<00:00:07.370> are<00:00:07.399> in<00:00:07.790> a<00:00:07.819> sonic<00:00:08.240> ser<00:00:08.990> age<00:00:09.260> 64<00:00:09.980> a

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
all we got are in a sonic ser age 64 a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.209 
all we got are in a sonic ser age 64 a
camera<00:00:10.369> main<00:00:11.209> component<00:00:11.779> and<00:00:13.059> uh<00:00:14.859> this<00:00:15.859> I

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
camera main component and uh this I

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.329 
camera main component and uh this I
wouldn't<00:00:17.180> really<00:00:17.359> call<00:00:17.480> it<00:00:17.859> that<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.099> field

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
wouldn't really call it that the field

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.089 
wouldn't really call it that the field
is<00:00:19.550> really<00:00:19.910> random<00:00:20.210> parts<00:00:20.810> they<00:00:21.199> say<00:00:21.470> I

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
is really random parts they say I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.900 
is really random parts they say I
believe<00:00:22.519> is<00:00:23.230> right<00:00:24.230> here<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:24.949> piece<00:00:25.310> is<00:00:25.699> just

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
believe is right here this piece is just

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.339 
believe is right here this piece is just
a<00:00:26.150> piece<00:00:26.570> from<00:00:28.269> what<00:00:29.269> is<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:29.659> like<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.839> telescope

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
a piece from what is it like a telescope

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.010 
a piece from what is it like a telescope
get<00:00:31.130> ya<00:00:31.820> telescope<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:32.870> um<00:00:34.570> 435<00:00:35.570> move<00:00:35.780> your

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
get ya telescope it um 435 move your

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.540 
get ya telescope it um 435 move your
camera<00:00:36.170> just<00:00:36.500> goes<00:00:36.830> right<00:00:37.040> now<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:37.460> you

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
camera just goes right now and so you

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.960 
camera just goes right now and so you
can<00:00:37.700> see<00:00:37.760> into<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.210> telescope<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:39.970> right

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
can see into the telescope and right

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.880 
can see into the telescope and right
here<00:00:41.180> where<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:41.570> tape<00:00:41.900> is<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.380> can't<00:00:42.590> see<00:00:42.770> it

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
here where this tape is you can't see it

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.630 
here where this tape is you can't see it
but<00:00:43.700> it's<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:44.060> 37<00:00:45.850> 252<00:00:46.870> millimeter<00:00:48.430> step<00:00:49.430> up

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
but it's a 37 252 millimeter step up

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.620 
but it's a 37 252 millimeter step up
ring<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.230> it's<00:00:51.230> like<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.380> long<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:53.030> gives<00:00:53.480> it

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
ring and it's like a long it gives it

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.830 
ring and it's like a long it gives it
more<00:00:53.750> vague<00:00:54.080> on<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.530> video<00:00:54.890> um<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:55.790> threw<00:00:56.690> that

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
more vague on the video um I threw that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.980 
more vague on the video um I threw that
in<00:00:57.080> with<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.830> topi<00:00:58.220> Noel<00:00:58.810> 35<00:00:59.810> millimeter<00:01:00.260> um

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
in with the topi Noel 35 millimeter um

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.160 
in with the topi Noel 35 millimeter um
52<00:01:02.990> wide-angle<00:01:03.830> class<00:01:04.600> then<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:05.720> have<00:01:05.930> our

to use it anyway I drilled this in my my
handle<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.790> took<00:02:17.970> piece<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.930> metal

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
handle I just took piece of metal

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.589 
handle I just took piece of metal
doesn't<00:02:20.160> matter<00:02:20.400> any<00:02:20.730> piece<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.060> metal<00:02:21.299> you

doesn't matter any piece of metal you

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.150 
doesn't matter any piece of metal you
have<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:23.010> find<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.610> out<00:02:23.730> any<00:02:24.090> type<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.629> way

have our decline devices French LCD one

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.949 
have our decline devices French LCD one
said<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.730> mean<00:02:42.420> LCD<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:45.180> little<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.629> to

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
said I mean LCD and a little like to

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:58.130 
said I mean LCD and a little like to
ball<00:02:46.200> sent<00:02:48.079> camera<00:02:49.079> store<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:55.250> see<00:02:57.140> basically

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
ball sent camera store and see basically

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.699 
ball sent camera store and see basically
for<00:02:58.829> now<00:02:59.239> that<00:03:00.239> will<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:02.760> rate<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.750> do<00:03:03.989> have
