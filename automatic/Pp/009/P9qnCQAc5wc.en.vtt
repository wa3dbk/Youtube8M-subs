I can get as many critical hits in as
little<00:00:50.129> time<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.460> possible<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:52.110> level<00:00:52.710> 8

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

flat off drew this will boost my
critical<00:00:54.930> ascension<00:00:55.320> counts<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.399> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
critical ascension counts so that when I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
critical ascension counts so that when I
do<00:00:56.550> switch<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> shock<00:00:58.079> damage

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
do switch on over to the shock damage

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
do switch on over to the shock damage
relic<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> sloth<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.359> doing<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
lot of damage you'll notice that while I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
lot of damage you'll notice that while I
was<00:01:03.149> stacking<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:04.049> my<00:01:04.199> B<00:01:04.379> happened<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> be

Pete but that was obviously not my

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
amo left at which point I will activate

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
amo left at which point I will activate
an<00:01:14.700> ammo<00:01:15.030> box<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:15.780> ahead<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.320> switch<00:01:16.650> on

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
an ammo box and go ahead and switch on

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.850 
an ammo box and go ahead and switch on
over<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> shock<00:01:17.759> damage<00:01:18.000> relic<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.860> am

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
over to the shock damage relic I am

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620 
over to the shock damage relic I am
wearing<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.189> alkaline<00:01:20.670> B<00:01:20.850> shield<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> just

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
wearing an alkaline B shield so I just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480 
wearing an alkaline B shield so I just
use<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> Nova<00:01:22.530> time<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:23.009> Pete<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> go

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
use that to Nova time for Pete to go

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.890 
use that to Nova time for Pete to go
ahead<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:23.939> some<00:01:24.119> more<00:01:24.240> critical<00:01:24.689> hits

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
ahead and get some more critical hits

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
ahead and get some more critical hits
because<00:01:25.350> he<00:01:25.470> holds<00:01:25.619> his<00:01:25.830> head<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.220> still

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
because he holds his head really still

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
because he holds his head really still
and<00:01:26.850> unprotected<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.810> particular

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
and unprotected in that particular

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
and unprotected in that particular
situation<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.450> am<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> about

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
situation so now that I am down to about

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
situation so now that I am down to about
40<00:01:31.530> ammo<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.280> 50<00:01:32.729> ammo<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> guess<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.450> went<00:01:33.570> ahead

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
40 ammo or 50 ammo I guess I went ahead

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
40 ammo or 50 ammo I guess I went ahead
and<00:01:34.110> activated<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.040> ammo<00:01:35.490> box<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and activated the ammo box because it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
and activated the ammo box because it
will<00:01:36.509> wait<00:01:36.750> sniper<00:01:37.229> rifle<00:01:37.590> ammo<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.100> me<00:01:38.189> just

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
will wait sniper rifle ammo for me just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
will wait sniper rifle ammo for me just
a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.549> bit<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.900> gonna<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.229> ahead

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
a little bit and now I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
a little bit and now I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.740> slag<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.189> Pete<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> start<00:01:42.030> getting

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and get slag on Pete and start getting

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.100 
and get slag on Pete and start getting
critical<00:01:42.509> hits<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.200> B<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> sloth

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
critical hits with the B and the sloth

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
critical hits with the B and the sloth
now<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> swath<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.729> powered<00:01:48.030> up

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
now that the swath is really powered up

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
now that the swath is really powered up
by<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.450> critical<00:01:48.869> ascension<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> really

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
by my critical ascension it has a really

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
by my critical ascension it has a really
high<00:01:50.070> base<00:01:50.460> damage<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:51.000> start<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.689> it's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
high base damage to start with so it's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.440 
high base damage to start with so it's
gonna<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.140> doing<00:01:52.380> quite<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.799> damage

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
gonna be doing quite a bit of damage

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
gonna be doing quite a bit of damage
Pete's<00:01:54.450> gonna<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.780> ahead<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> fire<00:01:55.619> Nova

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
Pete's gonna go ahead and do a fire Nova

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
Pete's gonna go ahead and do a fire Nova
here<00:01:56.189> I'll<00:01:56.340> avoid<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.880> by<00:01:57.149> hiding<00:01:57.479> beyond

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
here I'll avoid that by hiding beyond

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
here I'll avoid that by hiding beyond
the<00:01:57.869> scaffolding<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:59.040> ahead<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> push<00:01:59.790> Pete

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the scaffolding go ahead and push Pete

the scaffolding go ahead and push Pete
to<00:02:00.270> shield<00:02:00.689> depletion<00:02:01.140> mode<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.560> which<00:02:01.740> point

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to shield depletion mode at which point

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
to shield depletion mode at which point
he's<00:02:02.159> gonna<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.490> another<00:02:02.729> Nova<00:02:03.180> I'll<00:02:03.390> take

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
he's gonna do another Nova I'll take

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
he's gonna do another Nova I'll take
this<00:02:04.020> opportunity<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.770> grab<00:02:05.009> extra<00:02:05.369> sniper

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
rifle ammo so that I'll have enough to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.710 
rifle ammo so that I'll have enough to
finish<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.860> fight<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.119> goal<00:02:09.660> of
