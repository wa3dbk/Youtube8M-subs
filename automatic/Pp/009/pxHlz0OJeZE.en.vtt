00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.430
 now let's see how your child how we can recover deleted files 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.130
 accidentally either by formatting or by some 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.249
 some external concessions in which may we have been able to save I saw a lot 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.220
 information 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 The first thing I should do is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.079
 download it from some page 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.050
 the inspector ps fahel recovery 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.509
 by closing the page very much 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.649
 auth sudan puntocom 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 you can see it download in a way 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.570
 later after it 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.110
 unload 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.590
 we will not forget 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.590
 programs 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.340
 a window like this one is going to come out the hotels we are going to choose him 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.260
 lion that we want 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 sides with the new popcorn phenomenon 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.930
 I have three options 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.990
 in equipping the lost units against the requested data 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.610
 today we were interested in the moment to recover bad deleted files 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.310
 we will go 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.400
 macanudo ap a little window as they are macua that give us to place the unit 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.950
 logic 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 in case it would be a kingston 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 we do not select August from the popcorn 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 now this page 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.299
 in some cases it may take depending on the size of the unit 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 we go to the eliminated goats 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 posteriomente novel ernesto 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.620
 they do not leave everything 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.210
 green file 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
 in which we find for exxon those who 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.770
 have been erased in said unit 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 the selected messi expanded 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.510
 for example SMEs 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.570
 of bonuses save in 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.480
 I teach bologna where we want to save 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.810
 in this case, the desk is known 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 the ospa the popcorn 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.390
 and now either johnson has already recovered that file 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.129
 here you can against 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 the 0 8 that was found 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.719
 In case you do not think we can not find the file I can sit 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.549
 here 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.079
 there is the magnifying glass against by name I can give you the name of the file or the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.139
 extension to quique to search 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.739
 popcorn and this will reduce the chances 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.739
 increases the chances I sell TV goat 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.579
 finally we have to remember 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.049
 when 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.049
 in which the more the less you use computers 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.290
 great the possibility of being able to find again the files that have been 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.209
 erased 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.209
 but it is recommended 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.519
 that knows abel pÃ©rez inspector 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.639
 but most of the programs are norton de lares 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.760
 any two-color programmed cut that write the disk that between less and 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.249
 write it down the possibility of recovering our archives
