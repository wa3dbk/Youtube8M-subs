school time when ya girls or something I
get<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
get that I get that it's just one of

get that I get that it's just one of
those<00:00:37.170> things<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:38.870> essentially<00:00:39.870> it's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
those things that like essentially it's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.600 
those things that like essentially it's
there<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> reason<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> look<00:00:41.460> at

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
there for a reason that's how I look at

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
there for a reason that's how I look at
and<00:00:41.790> say<00:00:41.850> why<00:00:42.000> these<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.329> points<00:00:42.570> even<00:00:42.660> exist

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and say why these some points even exist

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
and say why these some points even exist
why<00:00:43.200> why<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.550> northern

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
why why is there in the northern

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.180 
why why is there in the northern
hemisphere<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.539> 440<00:00:46.260> nuclear<00:00:46.620> power<00:00:46.860> plants

and<00:00:47.309> radioactive<00:00:47.760> iodine<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> atmosphere

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and radioactive iodine in the atmosphere

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
and radioactive iodine in the atmosphere
I'd<00:00:49.260> recommend<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.070> I'd<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> become<00:00:50.789> part<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
I'd recommend that I'd I become part of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.270 
I'd recommend that I'd I become part of
your<00:00:51.030> protocol<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:52.110> balance<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> protect

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
your protocol to balance out and protect

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.939 
your protocol to balance out and protect
you<00:00:53.550> from<00:00:53.760> absorbing<00:00:54.149> radioactive<00:00:55.079> iodine<00:00:55.410> if

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you from absorbing radioactive iodine if

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
you from absorbing radioactive iodine if
I<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.449> totally<00:00:57.899> black<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I was going to just go totally black a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
I was going to just go totally black a
Leo<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.859> bra<00:00:59.100> food<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.670> whatever<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.239> no

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
Leo or bra food or whatever and no

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
Leo or bra food or whatever and no
supplements<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
supplements at all and I get that it's a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
supplements at all and I get that it's a
good<00:01:02.520> idea<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> recommended

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
good idea and it's a recommended

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.450 
good idea and it's a recommended
actually<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.830> good<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.040> clean

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
actually because it's good to just clean

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.710 
actually because it's good to just clean
everything<00:01:05.700> away<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.360> find<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.460> then

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
everything away and just find out then

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
everything away and just find out then
I'm<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.590> pretty<00:01:11.100> much<00:01:11.310> having<00:01:11.670> an

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I'm gonna be like pretty much having an

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.700 
I'm gonna be like pretty much having an
interesting<00:01:12.119> destiny<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.409> I'm

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
interesting destiny but I know that I'm

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
interesting destiny but I know that I'm
not<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.250> able<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> activate<00:01:15.270> certain

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you know for certain genes that might be

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.420 
you know for certain genes that might be
activated<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.380> something<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
activated by something like this that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.300 
activated by something like this that
could<00:01:23.939> give<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> lifespan<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.840> 150<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.830> might

could give me a lifespan of 150 I might

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
could give me a lifespan of 150 I might
make<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> 220<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.770> 250

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
make it 220 but I'm not going to get 250

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.649 
make it 220 but I'm not going to get 250
there's<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> certain<00:01:30.119> thing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
there's going to be a certain thing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
there's going to be a certain thing
based<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> natural<00:01:31.380> natural<00:01:32.070> lifestyle

of what's here available on this earth

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.530 
of what's here available on this earth
it's<00:01:35.460> only<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> certain

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's only going to get me to a certain

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.060 
it's only going to get me to a certain

point so when it comes to something like
this<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.970> looking<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> exotic

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this for me I'm looking at that exotic

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
this for me I'm looking at that exotic
possibility<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.030> looking<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:42.990> in

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
possibility I'm looking at actually in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
possibility I'm looking at actually in
this<00:01:43.229> particular<00:01:43.500> case<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.220> looking<00:01:44.490> at

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this particular case of looking at

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.969 
this particular case of looking at

sirt uin what number one gene which is a
particular<00:01:51.360> epigenetic<00:01:53.299> challenge<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
particular epigenetic challenge it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
particular epigenetic challenge it's
hard<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> activate<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> gene<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.130> promotes

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
hard to activate that gene that promotes

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.039 
hard to activate that gene that promotes
longevity<00:01:56.790> they're<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> promote

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
longevity they're going to promote

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
longevity they're going to promote
extreme<00:01:58.350> longevity<00:01:58.710> over<00:01:59.189> 120<00:01:59.790> years<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.149> life

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
extreme longevity over 120 years of life

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240 
extreme longevity over 120 years of life
which<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:00.960> getting<00:02:01.439> away<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> real

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
which is getting away from the real

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.399 
which is getting away from the real
triggers<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.780> milk<00:02:04.560> which<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.409> grains

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
triggers which is milk which is a grains

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.820 
triggers which is milk which is a grains
and<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> sugar<00:02:09.420> yes<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.470> off<00:02:10.619> of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and which is sugar yes you get off of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.750 
and which is sugar yes you get off of
those<00:02:10.979> three<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> paleo<00:02:12.239> principle

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
those three which is a paleo principle

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.089 
those three which is a paleo principle
actually<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.659> it's<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.500> boom<00:02:14.769> eighty

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
actually you it's like boom eighty

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.350 
actually you it's like boom eighty
percent<00:02:15.189> group<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:15.879> health<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.209> right
