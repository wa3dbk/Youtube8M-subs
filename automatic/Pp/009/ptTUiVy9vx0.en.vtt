 North Korean defectors who came to Korea to find jobs and take their lives 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.209
 However, due to prejudice and discrimination, 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.269
 English is one of those barriers 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.519
 To foreigners living in Korea voluntarily 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.469

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.789
 It is an opportunity to understand each other's culture.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.380
 Writing 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 It was a bigger problem. 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.469
