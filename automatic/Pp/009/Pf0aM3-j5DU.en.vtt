00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello and welcome to the geek mps 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.940
 today we will act as if we 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.370
 discover windows 8 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.620
 windhoek for English so here we go 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.010
 arrive on this menu so we lose a little 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.520
 the habit he's clearly it's for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.050
 the touch world so I do not know my 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
 mouse seems not want to work 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.119
 correctly with that maybe they 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
 have to window to doubt not without the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 first thing to do is good 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 obviously go on the desk for 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.149
 to find his little ones once 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 arrives on this wooden desk away 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.020
 I still miss a little something 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.969
 thing the start menu is gone either it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.610
 disappeared not so much with it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.980
 find on the right here precisely 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 so you bring the cursor a bar to 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 right you have it if we other 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 tips was simple relied on 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.289
 windows 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.930
 and that's you have the start menu so 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.980
 we will click on its start menu 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 there they take us back to the entrance so 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.560
 it's not very interesting so 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 anyway this is where you'll get 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830
 everything is you application once 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.960
 you will have them installed 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.049
 the other trick went from a search 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 and there you find a little like you 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.830
 wanted in the menu before you have 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 the parameters explains and so it's 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.439
 is not lost we are not lost so 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.189
 the windows key this and will be very very 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.229
 important 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.210
 good when we arrive on a windows 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.079
 obviously the first thing to do 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 it's going to update it so age 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.479
 press the windows key for me 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 find 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.229
 I go to the office and the p I read 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.490
 in settings and there miracle of things 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 we will modify my settings 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 so we can customize the screen of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.470
 lock and caen welcome let's talk 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.159
 the avatar of its context is here at 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.040
 nothing miraculous have managed the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.689
 users we have little notifications 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.720
 achievements activities 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.450
 we are looking for how 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.540
 set it up a bit shared because 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.760
 what how to share 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.910
 obviously the small parameters 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.020
 general still well the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.290
 confidentiality 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.040
 you see I broke nothing 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.010
 confidential 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.770
 the devices so if you have any 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.440
 connect month thing working under 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.930
 vmware fashionable men's 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.790
 economy the synchronization of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.960
 settings the residential group I know 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.060
 absolutely no processor and I you 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.020
 plug me what will interest me it's 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.140
 Windows Update 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.760
 so we can do some research and 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.100
 for now we have not seen quite 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.590
 elsewhere so we will have then on the sidelines 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.459
 windows that plays and who ever since to 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.260
 the time will be absolutely essential 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.790
 so to come back on the stuff it's 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.070
 always go beating still exists 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.050
 and an important update I the 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.340
 see you later this is actually 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.890
 hollow this home 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.900
 we see we have an internet explorer 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.260
 intentions that will not be the same as 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.320
 whoever will be under the desk the all 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.480
 fun like the weather and it's on this 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.709
 homepage we can put what 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.450
 we want there is no limit mans gold 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.920
 there we may not be as long as the weather 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.060
 charge to go do something else like 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.430
 that 's the first point of the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.670
 day 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.670
 it happens 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.930
 so why these blocks and well everything 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.640
 just because he was waiting for a 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.370
 permission of gide is not because 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.700
 they're great with this version it's 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.480
 that we can put these pages directly 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.269
 favorite 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:58.599
 where it is simple me my page 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:04:00.459
 it is preferred that it is said that dot fr 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.750
 it's a browser that integrates so I 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.930
 do not necessarily understand everything 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.180
 operation 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.900
 the browser barrier these browsers 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.120
 we see who was missing something 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.579
 do not know why there is a player who has 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.850
 disappeared then no sake sauce it you 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:29.770
 just talent and open the same page 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:33.240
 with the internet and will be from here and 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.710
 normally we find the player or not 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.870
 we see that both browsers 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.610
 are a little different so and memory 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:49.360
 to the other browser offers when 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:57.280
 is not happy to go see with the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.960
 browser principle still some bugs 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.440
 well I do not want third party or any 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.440
 weird 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.280
 my following is going to be to install some 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.949
 software because it's very nice 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.659
 has a whole list of software that we 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.310
 serve as usual not to big 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.310
 thing 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.699
 So go find where he is treated 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.270
 in camera camera trance we do not get started 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.430
 what's the point of the risky task? 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.349
 connect a camera of this damage and 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.960
 I have a webcam obviously did not see it 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.180
 so she has to go and that's it 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.280
 starts to accumulate to close alt 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.919
 f4 and locks up the weather has arrived 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.229
 this is my box inhabitants that we 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.719
 see again it's nice they have they have a 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.050
 great treat video we are listening 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.050
 know 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.319
 we have all the forecast tour match 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.270
 to go be there then I do not know 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:04.289
 why here my memory does not work 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:10.370
 not I can not navigate like I 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:10.370
 want what all the weather 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:17.599
 our stuff we'll go to youtube by 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:23.379
 example I'm sure you will look 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:25.309
 not all all this video like this 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.080
 what can we really not go 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:35.689
 see if nick hamm psg videos 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:37.789
 nice ah well we have the same idea fofi 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:44.409
 sky we have browser tests like we 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:46.279
 will take charge alone 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.719
 then is what can be put in 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.960
 full screen I'm not sure it 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:53.839
 returns 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:57.439
 something there until then it's clear 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:07:01.520
 the lower back and it does not work very well 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:03.729
 obviously I stayed in wifi so we 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.330
 see that it works 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:10.789
 that's it for this first part I'm going 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.259
 I will stop the video there we go I 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.979
 put download some software and 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.979
 see how it goes
