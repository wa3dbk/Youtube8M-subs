00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone I'm so glad 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.359
 find to talk to you about a small 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.610
 subject that is important to me 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 here and see that it's much better ben 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 I wanted to make a video for 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.429
 power to be able to help some 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.190
 people who went through what 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.789
 I passed then I will talk about 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.560
 hair loss bath from to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.500
 childbirth but a vast post 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.810
 childbirth so here I am going to you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 speak quickly I explained you quickly 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.050
 did what happened to me so after a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.120
 childbirth you know that maybe 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 not but you have a fall from 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.760
 hormones that this train which which is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 therefore translates to a hair loss 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.940
 after the important thing it depends on 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.890
 every woman 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600
 but I lost a lot of them 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 really enormously and I really had 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 to do because that's what it was 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.539
 really a very, very big fall from 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 hair I lost a lot and I 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 desperate I was afraid to become 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.190
 bald to tell you it's not 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.539
 possible I really had to do 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 to become bald besides my husband too 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.050
 the remark and here I am much less 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.649
 of volume but now it's going a lot 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.619
 better 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.189
 here I was doing nothing I leave them such 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
 what more they were dry 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.000
 he really was not well co 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 so this is the first time I 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 blow-dry since 20 since 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.570
 month we say it's been a month actually 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.200
 since I was cut hair 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 at the hairdresser 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 good here and I also made an andy 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.439
 anson so it's these are these small 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.909
 wicks actually just on the top and 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.369
 elsewhere I do not have 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.950
 so here I am a little 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.329
 cut to refresh a little bit and I 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.079
 am and I cut the hair 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.909
 so you do not have to worry about it 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.530
 has small solutions so I'm going 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.280
 give you my little solutions what 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.320
 so I did for to counter so 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.689
 this fall this massive fall of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 hair so firstly I was doing myself 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.909
 masks 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.990
 so with either with pure coconut oil 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.300
 watch out for coconut oil 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.730
 the color so 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 that's why he clarifies and he 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.820
 do not apply them on the leather 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.560
 hairy but just on the lengths and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.810
 spikes on the scalp I was applying 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.080
 Castor oil 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.550
 that's who's super who fortify your 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.750
 hair and nails also I have 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.310
 areas I never had uncles who 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.190
 thought I never had others who 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.860
 pushed as much and it happens to me too 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.540
 I happened I also apply the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.220
 restorative complex with fig oil 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.710
 of barbarism which is great also it's a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.790
 restorative and regenerating serum for 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.530
 hair 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.210
 so here is the level of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.450
 Shampoos should avoid the sulphates 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.790
 which actually tend to hit at 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.830
 to raise the hair even more 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.110
 I took a shampoo from Kerastase 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.910
 of the range densifies so it's wine 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 Density is a pub in a shampoo 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.320
 body tonicity substance for 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.200
 hair in loss of density and it makes 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.090
 this one 18 euros so it's a it's a 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.860
 special shampoo and frankly he got me 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.510
 really I would say saved life is 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.900
 the one I use all the time 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.650
 since I believe since practically 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.480
 three weeks 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.640
 so here I find that my hair and 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.989
 they have volume and I think for 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.459
 those who follow me enough 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.530
 regularly you had to see the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.690
 change because frankly I had 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.270
 really send the holes to the level at 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.570
 level mokrane is horrible and 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.430
 so that I followed a course of capsules 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.560
 like that besides these Mauritius islands 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.270
 more than my last box it was a 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.390
 lot of 3 watts here you have two 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.770
 different capsules and this is the dancy 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.170
 refill food supplements 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.100
 high growth enhancer this volume 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.170
 and shine 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.720
 and this is killing I think it is 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.950
 80 euros 7 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.480
 this cure the year is my girlfriend who 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.280
 gave it to me because it 's not 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.920
 served so that's after after I 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.850
 after finishing so I will soon 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.440
 completed the cure of two at kerastase 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.100
 I had also bought in pharmacy 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.840
 the strong cap there so I took 20 for 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.660
 three months it was a special offer 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.550
 three months out of three months out of 34 years and 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.760
 after I'm done, I'll go 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.050
 on that and then I'll see you 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.000
 that I had taken that too 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.440
 surface it's the optimum brand and 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.270
 it's for strong hair and nails and 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.340
 as I will not throw all together I 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.250
 want all used here this one I 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.750
 had used it at the beginning before having 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.050
 before actually running away from home 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.750
 kerastase here and then I do not use 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.580
 more or I avoid using this kind of 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.810
 tweezers and elastics because that 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.970
 you tear off your hair 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.020
 I rather use this kind of tongs in 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.570
 done who is still very very who 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.610
 do not attack your hair here and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.500
 finally to finish so I use this 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.750
 kind of this kind of brushes so to 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.400
 boar hair that works a lot 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.200
 least a hair tangle teaser 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.210
 whatever they say to me it tears me off 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.919
 a lot of hair so here I am 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.720
 prefer the little brush that I have since 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.890
 years besides this frozen brush 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.970
 since my high school years 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:03.000
 so it's a wooden brush with 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.560
 real boar bristles so super 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.680
 they are very flexible 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.700
 he brushes great well you see that and 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.550
 besides I can even do my 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.180
 blow-dry with it's the top 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.419

 solutions 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.900
