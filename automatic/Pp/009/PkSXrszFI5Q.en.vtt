bridge<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.880> i<00:00:32.910> figured<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.720> Scott

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
bridge because i figured that Scott

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
bridge because i figured that Scott
could<00:00:34.200> try<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.770> intelligence<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
could try and get that intelligence and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
could try and get that intelligence and
I<00:00:36.300> could<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.630> helped<00:00:36.870> him<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.080> but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.410> kind

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
I could have helped him out but I kind

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.110 
I could have helped him out but I kind
of<00:00:38.070> wanted<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.400> keep<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> Bridge<00:00:39.090> here

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
of wanted to keep on this Bridge here

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
of wanted to keep on this Bridge here
cuz<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.480> didn't<00:00:39.630> have<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.200> many<00:00:40.320> people<00:00:40.620> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I was constantly doing this and when I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100 
I was constantly doing this and when I
look<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.880> it's<00:00:57.630> kind<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.810> like<00:00:57.900> why

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
look at this now it's kind of like why

were<00:00:58.290> you<00:00:58.440> doing<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.920> cuz<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.760> lot

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
were you doing this cuz it's a lot

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
were you doing this cuz it's a lot
tougher<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.989> jump<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.530> shoot<00:01:01.890> rather<00:01:02.520> than<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
tougher to jump and shoot rather than to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.420 
tougher to jump and shoot rather than to
just<00:01:02.850> jump<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.420> evade<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> like

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.930 
easier to just stay on the ground and
shoot<00:01:30.229> now<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.409> CTF<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.280> team<00:01:32.520> captures

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
shoot now in CTF when your team captures

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.180 
shoot now in CTF when your team captures
the<00:01:33.060> flag<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.840> entire<00:01:34.200> team<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.770> gets

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
the flag your entire team actually gets

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.940 
the flag your entire team actually gets
crits<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:37.229> server<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
crits and on this server I think this

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.820 
crits and on this server I think this
was<00:01:38.130> left<00:01:38.280> her<00:01:38.520> server<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:39.200> had<00:01:40.200> crits<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:40.710> like

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
was left her server I had crits for like

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.380 
was left her server I had crits for like
eight<00:01:41.010> seconds<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.030> weird<00:01:42.210> I'm

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
eight seconds it was really weird I'm

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
eight seconds it was really weird I'm
not<00:01:42.420> easy<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.380> server<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.770> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
not easy to that the server that I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.500 
not easy to that the server that I
usually<00:01:43.950> play<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.940> play<00:01:45.090> capture<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
usually play on when we play capture the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.080 
usually play on when we play capture the
flag<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.260> crits<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.369> usually<00:01:47.760> lasts

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
flag and I get crits it usually lasts

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.789 
flag and I get crits it usually lasts
for<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.479> second<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.619> not

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
for about a second or so so it's not

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.050 
for about a second or so so it's not
really<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> big

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
really you know it's not really a big

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
really you know it's not really a big
deal<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.479> someone<00:01:51.930> catches<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.380> flag

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
deal when someone catches the flag

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.719 
deal when someone catches the flag
because<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.280> crits<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.640> like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
because we want to get crits for like

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.130 
because we want to get crits for like
one<00:01:53.909> second<00:01:54.330> so<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.600> enough<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> get<00:01:54.990> like

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
one second so that's enough to get like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.520 
one second so that's enough to get like
one<00:01:55.350> shot<00:01:55.650> off<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.150> server<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
one shot off but in this server the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.679 
one shot off but in this server the
chris<00:01:58.950> lasts<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> pretty<00:01:59.700> long<00:01:59.970> time<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
chris lasts for a pretty long time and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.830 
chris lasts for a pretty long time and
so<00:02:00.900> I'm<00:02:01.560> getting<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.520> nervous<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so I'm getting kind of like nervous and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
so I'm getting kind of like nervous and
trying<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> use<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> crits<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:04.950> effectively<00:02:05.400> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
trying to use the crits up effectively I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920 
trying to use the crits up effectively I
ended<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.820> missing<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.479> how<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> am<00:02:06.810> with

right every time I get crits it's like
the<00:02:11.159> frontier<00:02:11.519> justice<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.120> panic<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.989> get

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
those crisp very effectively but you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.350 
those crisp very effectively but you
the<00:02:18.160> server<00:02:18.400> actually<00:02:18.640> had<00:02:18.880> pretty<00:02:19.120> long

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the server actually had pretty long

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.140 
the server actually had pretty long
crits<00:02:20.160> now<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.490> gameplay<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.910> little

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
crits now on to the gameplay a little

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.850 
crits now on to the gameplay a little
bit<00:02:22.330> luckily<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.140> engineer<00:02:23.590> built<00:02:23.800> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
bit luckily this engineer built a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.230 
bit luckily this engineer built a
dispenser<00:02:24.340> right<00:02:24.550> here<00:02:24.820> in<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:24.970> little<00:02:25.120> room

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
dispenser right here in this little room

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.480 
dispenser right here in this little room
and<00:02:25.720> actually<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.710> health<00:02:26.980> pack<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
and actually the health pack in this

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.920 
and actually the health pack in this
room<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.790> really<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.120> useful<00:02:28.300> sometimes

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
room is really really useful sometimes

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.020 
room is really really useful sometimes
in<00:02:29.200> tight<00:02:29.620> situations<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.730> nice<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
in tight situations and so it's nice to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.850 
in tight situations and so it's nice to
have<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.270> health<00:02:31.450> pack<00:02:31.660> as<00:02:31.900> well<00:02:31.960> as<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
dispenser right there this is a good

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.600 
dispenser right there this is a good
place<00:02:35.170> also<00:02:35.410> flank<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.920> enemy<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.310> from<00:02:36.490> this

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
place also flank the enemy is from this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.550 
place also flank the enemy is from this
bottom<00:02:36.970> here<00:02:37.210> if<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.690> jump<00:02:37.960> down<00:02:38.020> as<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> scout

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
bottom here if you jump down as a scout

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.260 
bottom here if you jump down as a scout
I<00:02:38.620> didn't<00:02:39.160> do<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.370> time<00:02:39.520> but<00:02:39.940> since<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
I didn't do it that time but since you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.910 
I didn't do it that time but since you
can<00:02:40.390> double<00:02:40.690> jump<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.230> can<00:02:41.260> actually<00:02:41.650> jump

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
can double jump you can actually jump

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.830 
can double jump you can actually jump
down<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.580> very<00:02:42.700> bottom<00:02:42.820> level<00:02:43.480> without

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.990 
down to the very bottom level without
hurting<00:02:44.410> yourself<00:02:44.500> from<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.130> fall<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.850> you

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
hurting yourself from the fall if you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.430 
hurting yourself from the fall if you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
that spot you really did kill him

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.430 
that spot you really did kill him
because<00:03:15.610> he<00:03:15.850> was<00:03:16.000> weak<00:03:16.180> or<00:03:16.600> he<00:03:16.870> activated<00:03:17.290> a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
because he was weak or he activated a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.080 
because he was weak or he activated a
dead<00:03:17.650> ringer<00:03:17.860> just<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.400> safety<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:18.970> he's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
dead ringer just for safety and he's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.990 
dead ringer just for safety and he's
probably<00:03:19.270> gonna<00:03:19.450> Declo<00:03:19.960> somewhere<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.550> here<00:03:21.790> I

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
probably gonna Declo somewhere so here I

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.580 
probably gonna Declo somewhere so here I
think<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> dead<00:03:22.930> ringer<00:03:23.170> spy<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.560> I

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
think this is the dead ringer spy that I

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.500 
think this is the dead ringer spy that I
killed<00:03:23.860> before<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.310> couldn't<00:03:24.730> get<00:03:24.850> them<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.150> get
