00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.420
 all right 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.439
 today I would like to talk about huge 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.410
 holes that occur on the planet 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.329
 earth these huge holes are called 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.780
 sinkholes and occur through the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.449
 erosion of limestone with moisture 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.380
 that is with the passage of time and action 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.650
 of water and humidity 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.770
 the truth is that these holes can 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.420
 be quite worrying 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.130
 because there are some holes that are 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.500
 partial is to say that they are creating 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.110
 with the passage of time and there are others 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.200
 holes that start to be made from 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.230
 inside from within the cortex 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.540
 terrestrial for which these holes or 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.880
 sinkholes can reach the best 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.610
 cause a great disaster in a population 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 could cause a collapse by 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.210
 example a person who is walking around 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 the street by the road area 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.380
 because this could cause a subsidence 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.390
 of all that area leaving a big hole 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.820
 and of course killing all 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.300
 people who are in that area there are 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.000
 large sinkholes there are sinkholes of hundreds and 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.160
 hundreds of meters and there are two types of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.650
 fundamental dolines that form 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.140
 through the human being and those that 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.820
 they form naturally there are some 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.860
 holes that created the self 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.680
 human through the excavation of 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.410
 tunnels and handling 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.630
 of the earth but there are others that 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.160
 they originate naturally and that they can 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.070
 get to be considered as a 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.410
 natural catastrophe comes a moment in 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.500
 which has eroded so much the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.210
 land that there is a subsidence of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.630
 the earth of the layer that remains of the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.120
 outer layer that remains and generates a 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.400
 free fall of all people who 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.349
 are going through that area 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 has already happened several times in the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.150
 history of humanity and it's something 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.519
 terrifying some religious even 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.769
 they say it's the work of the devil that's 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.930
 because they are simply not documented 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.360
 of the action of nature the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.790
 nature can do things that sometimes 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.459
 It looks like the work of the devil or works of 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.609
 extraterrestrials but it is true that everything 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.470
 this today can be explained and not 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.109
 you have to fear nothing you just have to 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.530
 be aware of the formation of these 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.870
 phenomena to not pass right in the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.409
 time when that area is to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.409
 come down
