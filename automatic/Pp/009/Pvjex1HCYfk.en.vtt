00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Lets see the ingredients needed for making Shevyachi Barfi

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.760
200 grams boiled Vermicelli

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.780
150 grams sugar, 200 grams whole dry milk, 1 teaspoon Cardamom powder

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.360
Finely chopped almonds and water

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.700
Lets start making.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.120
The first thing we'll do is the sugar syrup

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:50.160
We'll add half proportion of water as the sugar. For eg. Take 1/2 cup water for 1 cup sugar.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.080
Our one string syrup will be ready.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.500
Till the syrup is getting read, I'll show you how to make the Vermicelli

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.880
Boil the water first and then add 200 grams Vermicelli that we got from the market

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:24.320
Let the Vermicelli cook for 2 minutes and then drain out the water from it and wash it once with normal water.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.720
Our Vermicelli is ready.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.340
We've grated the whole dry milk ( Khoya ) and we're going to use almonds for decoration.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.660
Now we'll concentrate on one string syrup

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.960
Sugar has melted, lets see if our one string syrup is ready

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.500
How to make the sugar syrup and how do we know it is ready? I tell you'll every time.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.020
So lift your spoon above the vessel and see if the last drop falls in a straight line.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.020
Our sugar syrup is ready, you can see a string

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.100
Add the Vermicelli in the syrup

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.040
Add the khoya ( Whole dry milk )

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.140
1 tablespoon cardamom powder

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.420
Stir it nicely.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.820
See to it that there are no lumps created. mix it nicely.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920
Lets switch off the gas.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.280
And serve it on a plate.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.780
We've to eat it after it gets warm. So we've have to set it before that.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.660
Use a aluminium tray for this and spread it  nicely.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.040
Its fine if you want to add some ghee

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480
Spread it nicely.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.980
Keep it stirring when its on gas otherwise it will get burnt

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.540
You can cut it nicely, after it turns warm

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.740
Our hot Shevyachi Barfi is ready, but you don't have to eat it when its hot

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.740
and you can also cover it with silver ( virk )
