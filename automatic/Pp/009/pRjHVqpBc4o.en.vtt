00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
tests don't show anything and so I found

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.160 
tests don't show anything and so I found
this<00:01:06.470> too<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:06.890> my<00:01:06.920> prior<00:01:07.370> career<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.690> I<00:01:09.020> would

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
this too in my prior career that I would

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.380 
this too in my prior career that I would
look<00:01:09.290> at<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.470> patient<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.100> do<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> thorough

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
look at a patient and do a thorough

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.860 
look at a patient and do a thorough
examination<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.410> uh<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.040> not<00:01:13.820> find<00:01:14.150> really

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
examination and uh and not find really

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.750 
examination and uh and not find really
what<00:01:15.050> was<00:01:15.080> wrong<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.680> my<00:01:15.950> laboratory<00:01:16.490> tests

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
what was wrong and my laboratory tests

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.050 
what was wrong and my laboratory tests
didn't<00:01:17.090> tell<00:01:17.240> me<00:01:17.360> either<00:01:17.830> so<00:01:18.830> along<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.610> way<00:01:19.760> I

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
didn't tell me either so along the way I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.480 
didn't tell me either so along the way I
ran<00:01:20.420> into<00:01:20.720> another<00:01:20.840> diagnostic<00:01:21.590> method<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
ran into another diagnostic method and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.490 
ran into another diagnostic method and
this<00:01:23.150> diagnostic<00:01:23.600> method<00:01:24.230> is<00:01:24.350> called

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
this diagnostic method is called

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.790 
this diagnostic method is called
nutritional<00:01:25.190> response<00:01:25.610> testing<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.530> I<00:01:27.530> found

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
nutritional response testing and I found

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.700 
nutritional response testing and I found
that<00:01:28.040> this<00:01:28.160> helped<00:01:28.490> me<00:01:28.730> more<00:01:29.150> than<00:01:29.440> any<00:01:30.440> other

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
that this helped me more than any other

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.070 
that this helped me more than any other
single<00:01:31.340> single<00:01:32.210> thing<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.660> could<00:01:32.900> do<00:01:33.050> to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
single single thing that I could do to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.600 
single single thing that I could do to
figure<00:01:33.470> out<00:01:33.620> what<00:01:33.770> was<00:01:33.860> wrong<00:01:33.920> with<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.250> patient

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
figure out what was wrong with a patient

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.470 
figure out what was wrong with a patient
now<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.660> idea<00:01:35.870> of<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:36.530> is<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.100> if<00:01:37.820> we<00:01:38.180> look

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
now the idea of this is that if we look

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.700 
now the idea of this is that if we look
at<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:39.050> body<00:01:39.320> as<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:40.820> bio-computer<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.870> this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
at the body as a bio-computer and this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.760 
at the body as a bio-computer and this
bio<00:01:42.980> computer<00:01:43.640> has<00:01:44.330> sets<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.960> reactions<00:01:45.650> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
bio computer has sets of reactions that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.610 
bio computer has sets of reactions that
it<00:01:46.010> produces<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.900> response<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.440> various

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
it produces in response to various

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.970 
it produces in response to various
things<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.280> are<00:01:49.370> going<00:01:49.550> on<00:01:49.730> with<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.980> we

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
things that are going on with it and we

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.970 
things that are going on with it and we
can<00:01:52.160> look<00:01:52.310> at<00:01:52.460> these<00:01:52.610> responses<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.510> by<00:01:54.440> by

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
can look at these responses and by by

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.090 
can look at these responses and by by
testing<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.730> responses<00:01:56.420> we<00:01:56.720> can<00:01:56.900> tell<00:01:57.230> what

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
testing the responses we can tell what

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.580 
testing the responses we can tell what
is<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.610> that's<00:01:59.150> bothering<00:01:59.270> or<00:02:00.050> stressing<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
what part of the body is not functioning

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.770 
what part of the body is not functioning
what<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.189> body

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
what is the body

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.860 
what is the body
sponding<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:21.190> isn't<00:02:21.340> normal<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.720> we

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
sponding to that isn't normal and so we

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.290 
sponding to that isn't normal and so we
can<00:02:23.050> do<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.740> by<00:02:24.040> testing<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.910> body's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
can do this by testing the body's

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.020 
can do this by testing the body's
response<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.959> stress<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.069> one<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.000> things

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
response to stress and one of the things

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.120 
response to stress and one of the things
that<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> body<00:02:28.660> does<00:02:28.990> in<00:02:29.319> response<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.920> stress

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that the body does in response to stress

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.290 
that the body does in response to stress
is<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.480> produces<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.140> reflex<00:02:32.860> now<00:02:33.670> reflex

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
is that it produces a reflex now reflex

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.330 
is that it produces a reflex now reflex
you're<00:02:34.750> all<00:02:34.870> familiar<00:02:35.050> with<00:02:35.319> if<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.069> take<00:02:36.310> a

front of my knee it just now that is a
nerve<00:02:51.880> reflex<00:02:52.739> well<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.070> use<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.459> same

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
nerve reflex well we can use the same

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.840 
nerve reflex well we can use the same
mechanism<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.600> nerve<00:02:55.840> reflexes<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.739> ask<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
mechanism of nerve reflexes and ask the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.820 
mechanism of nerve reflexes and ask the
body<00:02:58.060> questions<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.989> see<00:02:59.290> what<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> nerve

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
body questions and see what the nerve

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.580 
body questions and see what the nerve
reflexes<00:03:00.610> do<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> first<00:03:02.470> question

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
reflexes do and so the first question

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.059 
reflexes do and so the first question
that<00:03:03.190> we're<00:03:03.310> asking<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.790> body<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.769> able

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
that we're asking the body is is it able

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.729 
that we're asking the body is is it able
to<00:03:06.280> regulate<00:03:06.910> itself<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.110> able<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.560> produce

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
to regulate itself is it able to produce

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.720 
to regulate itself is it able to produce
a<00:03:10.230> sympathetic<00:03:11.230> stress<00:03:11.800> reaction<00:03:12.430> when<00:03:12.610> it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
a sympathetic stress reaction when it

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.259 
a sympathetic stress reaction when it
needs<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:14.920> able<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.519> produce<00:03:15.730> a

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
needs to and is it able to produce a

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.370 
needs to and is it able to produce a
parasympathetic<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:18.600> digestive<00:03:19.600> sleep

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
parasympathetic a digestive sleep

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.309 
parasympathetic a digestive sleep
restorative<00:03:21.370> reaction<00:03:22.060> when<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.690> has<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.110> and

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
restorative reaction when it has to and

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.400 
restorative reaction when it has to and
if<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.250> can't<00:03:24.610> then<00:03:24.940> there's<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.750> problem<00:03:26.079> going

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
if it can't then there's a problem going

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.490 
if it can't then there's a problem going
on<00:03:26.650> with<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:28.360> problem<00:03:28.750> has<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.140> do

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
on with it and that problem has to do

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.560 
on with it and that problem has to do
with<00:03:29.680> those<00:03:29.829> three<00:03:30.070> causes<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.670> disease<00:03:31.060> that

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
with those three causes of disease that

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.979 
with those three causes of disease that
we<00:03:31.750> talked<00:03:31.989> about<00:03:32.110> earlier<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.820> body<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.690> know

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
we talked about earlier the body we know

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.440 
we talked about earlier the body we know
then<00:03:35.350> if<00:03:35.560> this<00:03:35.739> if<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.100> if<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.820> body<00:03:37.030> cannot

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
then if this if this if the body cannot

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.560 
then if this if this if the body cannot
regulate<00:03:37.840> itself<00:03:38.290> properly<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.299> body

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
regulate itself properly that the body

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.990 
regulate itself properly that the body
then<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.230> suffering<00:03:41.680> from<00:03:41.980> probably<00:03:42.640> a

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
then is suffering from probably a

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.720 
then is suffering from probably a
mixture<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.709> things<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.040> deficient<00:03:45.430> in

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
mixture of things that is deficient in

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.449 
mixture of things that is deficient in
that<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.000> needs<00:03:46.709> things<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.860> it's<00:03:47.980> got<00:03:48.280> that

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
that it needs things that it's got that

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.640 
that it needs things that it's got that
it<00:03:48.609> shouldn't<00:03:48.910> have<00:03:49.120> toxicities<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.109> things

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
it shouldn't have toxicities and things

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.900 
it shouldn't have toxicities and things
that<00:03:50.799> it's<00:03:50.920> reacting<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.760> should

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
that it's reacting to that it should

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.319 
that it's reacting to that it should
react<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.359> allergies<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.060> test

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
react to allergies and so we can test

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.420 
react to allergies and so we can test
the<00:03:55.570> body<00:03:55.780> with<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.380> find<00:03:56.650> out<00:03:56.829> what's

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
the body with this and find out what's

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.479 
the body with this and find out what's
the<00:03:57.670> body's<00:03:58.090> priority<00:03:58.930> what<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.829> it<00:04:00.130> that's

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
the body's priority what is it that's

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.720 
the body's priority what is it that's
bothering<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:01.180> body<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.600> most<00:04:01.900> ok<00:04:02.890> now<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.489> do

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
bothering the body the most ok now we do

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.490 
bothering the body the most ok now we do
this<00:04:03.880> through<00:04:04.090> nutritional<00:04:04.750> response<00:04:05.109> test

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
this through nutritional response test

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.370 
this through nutritional response test
the<00:04:06.280> response<00:04:06.459> has<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.180> do<00:04:07.390> with<00:04:07.870> testing

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
the response has to do with testing

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.259 
the response has to do with testing
muscles<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:09.070> see<00:04:09.250> what<00:04:09.489> makes<00:04:09.670> them<00:04:09.940> strong

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
muscles to see what makes them strong

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.810 
muscles to see what makes them strong
and<00:04:10.510> what<00:04:10.750> makes<00:04:10.989> them<00:04:11.140> weak<00:04:11.380> if<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.549> want<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
and what makes them weak if you want to

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.220 
and what makes them weak if you want to
do<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:13.000> experiment<00:04:13.329> at<00:04:13.570> home<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:13.810> can<00:04:13.840> do<00:04:14.079> it

do is experiment at home you can do it

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.770 
do is experiment at home you can do it
have<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.010> money<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.760> hold<00:04:16.299> their<00:04:16.450> arm<00:04:16.630> out
