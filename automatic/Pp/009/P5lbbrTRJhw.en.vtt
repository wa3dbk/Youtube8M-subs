00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
very quickly I am completely wrong there

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
very quickly I am completely wrong there
it<00:01:41.880> says<00:01:42.060> micro<00:01:42.329> USB<00:01:42.720> port<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.079> setting<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it says micro USB port for setting and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
it says micro USB port for setting and
firmware<00:01:44.100> upgrade<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.149> yeah<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
firmware upgrade so yeah if you want to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.149 
firmware upgrade so yeah if you want to
charge<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.380> you're<00:01:46.560> actually<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
charge this you're actually going to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
charge this you're actually going to
have<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> batteries<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
have to take out the batteries and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030 
have to take out the batteries and
recharge<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
recharge them but that's not really a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.649 
recharge them but that's not really a
big<00:01:50.220> deal<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.149> go<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.420> take<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
big deal so there we go we take the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.760 
big deal so there we go we take the
bottom<00:01:51.930> off<00:01:52.110> we'll<00:01:52.350> go<00:01:52.409> ahead<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.619> stick

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
bottom off we'll go ahead and stick

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
bottom off we'll go ahead and stick
these<00:01:52.920> batteries<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.270> take<00:01:54.479> both<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
these batteries in it does take both of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.350 
these batteries in it does take both of
the<00:01:55.229> 18<00:01:55.619> 350<00:01:56.250> batteries<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.030> screw<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the 18 350 batteries and you screw it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
the 18 350 batteries and you screw it
all<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.630> together<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.799> about<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
all back together and that's about it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.740 
all back together and that's about it
basically<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.090> point<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.450> should<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
basically at this point you should be

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.149 
basically at this point you should be
able<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.140> go<00:02:01.619> ahead<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.770> stick<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
able to just go ahead and stick the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.700 
able to just go ahead and stick the
phone<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:03.000> you'll<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.170> does<00:02:04.409> pull

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
phone in here you'll see this does pull

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.560 
phone in here you'll see this does pull
apart<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.610> goes<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> pretty<00:02:06.119> decent

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
apart and it goes to a pretty decent

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.969 
apart and it goes to a pretty decent
width<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.020> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.649> will<00:02:07.799> fit

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
width I want to see if this will fit

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.350 
width I want to see if this will fit
some<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> larger<00:02:08.640> phones<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.030> I've<00:02:09.119> got

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
some of the larger phones that I've got

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.330 
some of the larger phones that I've got
so<00:02:10.110> let's<00:02:10.379> take<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.649> somewhere<00:02:10.890> else<00:02:11.009> we'll

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so let's take this somewhere else we'll

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.280 
so let's take this somewhere else we'll
put<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> phone<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.120> we

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
put a phone in and we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.809 
put a phone in and we
turn<00:02:12.439> it<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.709> okay<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.370> we're<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
turn it on okay so we're now in a

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.429 
turn it on okay so we're now in a
slightly<00:02:14.209> different<00:02:14.360> location<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.230> took<00:02:15.319> a

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
slightly different location I took a

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.440 
slightly different location I took a
little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.769> time<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.159> let<00:02:16.280> those<00:02:16.430> 18<00:02:16.879> 350

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
little bit of time to let those 18 350

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.479 
little bit of time to let those 18 350
batteries<00:02:17.870> charged<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:19.129> i'm<00:02:19.310> going<00:02:19.430> to

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
batteries charged and now i'm going to

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.640 
batteries charged and now i'm going to
try<00:02:19.670> putting<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.359> phone<00:02:20.719> inside<00:02:21.439> of<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
try putting a phone inside of the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.050 
try putting a phone inside of the
stabilizer<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.370> didn't<00:02:22.579> take<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.700> little<00:02:22.879> bit<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
stabilizer I didn't take a little bit of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.339 
stabilizer I didn't take a little bit of
time<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.390> read<00:02:23.569> through<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.810> manual<00:02:23.989> and

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
time to read through the manual and

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.539 
time to read through the manual and
basically<00:02:24.560> what<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.769> says<00:02:24.859> is<00:02:25.040> go<00:02:25.400> ahead<00:02:25.459> and

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
basically what it says is go ahead and

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.009 
basically what it says is go ahead and
stick<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.909> phone<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.269> before<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.629> power<00:02:26.900> it

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
stick the phone in before you power it

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.380 
stick the phone in before you power it
on<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.859> in<00:02:28.129> case<00:02:28.250> you're<00:02:28.430> curious<00:02:28.609> is<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.239> l

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
not do image stabilization out of the

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.569 
not do image stabilization out of the
box<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.650> i<00:02:33.680> wanted<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.099> go<00:02:34.280> ahead<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.489> give

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
box so i wanted to go ahead and give

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.099 
box so i wanted to go ahead and give
that<00:02:34.609> one<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:34.849> try<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:35.750> how<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.930> install

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
that one a try so that's how you install

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.080 
that one a try so that's how you install
it<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.590> basically<00:02:36.739> just<00:02:36.950> pull<00:02:37.579> this<00:02:37.730> back

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
it you basically just pull this back

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.759 
it you basically just pull this back
section<00:02:38.359> up<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.079> clip<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.319> over<00:02:39.590> whatever

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
section up and clip it over whatever
