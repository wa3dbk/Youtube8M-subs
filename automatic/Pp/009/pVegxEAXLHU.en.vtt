00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi the fans today I you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.819
 speaks of an element specifically 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.410
 feminine of sorry gentlemen but this 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.639
 will be for the next time this is what 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
 offers these ladies a certain 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.780
 posture some elegance a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 certain class but it is especially useful 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 to support an element of our body 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.160
 very important I'm talking about support 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.230
 throat 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 [Music] 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.099
 it's in less than 400 years before 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.619
 jesus christ that women began 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.110
 to wear what is called masses 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.820
 tones rate what is a behemoth 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.350
 the principle is simple these are 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.329
 kinds of bra that we roll 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.460
 around you like a mummy a little 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.620
 but just on the part where there is the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.699
 chest to hide it too 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.500
 amazing that this can be 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.390
 at the time the small breasts were at the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.650
 fashion and it was to the point that all 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.170
 women who started to have a 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.699
 growing too big breasts 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.739
 put on very leather thongs 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.720
 tight around the chest so the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.710
 prevent pushing and yes what are we 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.559
 would not do for fashion 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.140
 thereafter the gourgandine arrives it's 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.210
 which makes it possible to highlight 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.189
 really worth the saints or even 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.119
 leaving the breasts overflowing and I 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.970
 know what I'm talking about 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.770
 in the 16th century it is in Spain camaret 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.600
 for the first time the corset he is 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.479
 pulled from men's military armor 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.460
 and serves to mark the firmness of a lady 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.430
 the goal being to get the hips out 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.900
 and the chest 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.880
 it is very popular among the bourgeois 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.310
 and then it will happen to the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.500
 more popular backgrounds at the beginning if of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.450
 fabric and wood then we move on to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.970
 metal to finish on sorts of 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.440
 whales in the seventeenth century the whales 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.690
 you find on the umbrellas it's 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.420
 which allows to have the small form 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.150
 the victim the whales some 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 herminie cadolle speaks of a corset 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.710
 two pieces was boring his name is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.600
 well-being and there is a piece for the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.760
 size is a piece for the chest 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.350
 except that it's a little too much and the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640
 sales are not going much has taken off from 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.240
 blow it will be a little bit dropped in 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.040
 forgetfulness 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.290
 the corset and knows a beautiful evolution 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.860
 and at the beginning of the 20th century 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.890
 the sheath arrives in 1893 marie you know that 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.470
 gallerists endure to it deposits 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.569
 even the patent and it looks like a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.430
 pocket for each breast with thongs 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.549
 of fabric that's what gets closer the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.890
 more modern bra in 1904 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.120
 herminie offers the word holding throat 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.920
 holding to maintain and throats 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.750
 what refers to within but there is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.530
 had also the dubious proposal of the mount 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.120
 rett throat 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.510
 it was funny like throats would you have 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.489
 take off your throat I was dreaming but refurb 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.930
 if jack up makes the first 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.980
 bra with two handkerchiefs 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.829
 and a pink ribbon 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.659
 this innovation will be patented in 1914 and 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.299
 this is the beginning of the bra 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.860
 so in the 1920s the 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.959
 bra appears in the form of 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.950
 two separate hats and no more than one 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.230
 single headband 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.650
 today the existing unique headbands 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.150
 the three brothers of warner society 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.859
 makes a very elastic fabric 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.930
 it is even they who will improve the 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.430
 hat system that goes from a to d 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.129
 so the cap is the size of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.290
 the breadth of the breast in 1950 the pinup 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.390
 installs a fashion bra point 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.090
 you're not so stung but it's a 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.920
 fashion that made a splash in 1970 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.260
 women will burn bras in 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.890
 public in order to claim their freedom 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.900
 sexual 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.760
 it's a small revolution but 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.799
 important that aims to remove any 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.220
 sexual connotation at the chest 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.650
 female in 1981 chantal thomas lance 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.900
 the bra in lace or in either 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.430
 she is an icon of the 80s and the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.250
 women who many follow this fashion 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.680
 bra very recently in 2009 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.209
 in somalia women who wear a 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.489
 bra are whipping publicly 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.620
 because the wearing of this garment is 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.510
 totally forbidden today the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.489
 bra knows many forms of 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.359
 push up the paddle and so on 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.340
 Verry much 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.019
 you can also one per year m 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.819
 besides, there are a lot of small 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.169
 revolutions that are organized by 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.049
 women in particular 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.389
 fried anyone is to 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.079
 stroll bare breasts naked torso 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.879
 like men 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.709
 and finally what is sexual is 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.579
 that a breast is hidden that 's the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.500
 base of excitement 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.540
 there was a time when women especially 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.010
 the hippies were walking around the bare breasts 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.569
 with flowers on the nipples 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.579
 today these shocks photos that 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.230
 take care of your niche on ladies it's 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.380
 sorry for the little numbers now 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.390
 small numbers 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.459
 every day four million supporters 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.560
 throats are made with 4 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.990
 million a day imagine the figure to 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.060
 the year hop hop hop we do not leave 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.280
 without a little fun thing like for example 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.830
 in Japan where the true love bra 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.920
 is marketed it's a bra 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.800
 which aims to open only and 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.790
 only if the lady feels 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.640
 romantic feelings 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.230
 it's so beautiful no it's rather 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.980
 scary in fact then a little bit of 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.810
 romanticism 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.150
 the bra only opens if 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.600
 madam releases hormones and at this 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.850
 moment there 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.890
 the door is open but we can also 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.080
 course open strong you are in the 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.420

 in love of course also not a 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.120

 a pale thanks to her bra 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.050
 she had a hell of a bowl since 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.390
 the ball did not go through the frame of the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.880
 bra which saved her life 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.230
 otherwise it would be taking the ball in 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.120
 full heart and then the bomba that burst 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.580
