00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
out trying to reach the trigger and he's

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.240 
out trying to reach the trigger and he's
just<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.419> just<00:00:28.349> barely<00:00:28.590> touching<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
just like just barely touching on the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.499 
just like just barely touching on the
tip<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:29.550> he's<00:00:29.669> actually<00:00:29.820> pushing<00:00:30.180> down<00:00:30.480> on

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
tip and he's actually pushing down on

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.330 
tip and he's actually pushing down on
the<00:00:30.720> trigger<00:00:30.899> rather<00:00:31.649> than<00:00:31.950> pulling<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the trigger rather than pulling the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.130 
the trigger rather than pulling the
trigger<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:33.060> you<00:00:33.270> were<00:00:33.390> shooting<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.720> pistol<00:00:34.050> or

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
trigger if you were shooting a pistol or

a rifle you wouldn't wouldn't have your
fingers<00:00:36.210> stretched<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.630> you'd<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.960> full

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
fingers stretched out you'd have a full

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.049 
fingers stretched out you'd have a full
wrap<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.070> finger<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> 90

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
wrap in your finger would be on a 90

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.479 
wrap in your finger would be on a 90
degree<00:00:39.329> crook<00:00:39.630> around<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> trigger<00:00:40.920> well

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
degree crook around that trigger well

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.500 
degree crook around that trigger well
that's<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.910> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.179> try<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.359> achieve

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that's what we want to try to achieve

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.270 
that's what we want to try to achieve
with<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> bow<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> draw

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
with a with a bow I'm not going to draw

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.099 
with a with a bow I'm not going to draw
it<00:00:44.309> back<00:00:44.519> but<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.359> hook<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> trigger<00:00:45.960> on

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
it back but you just hook the trigger on

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.959 
it back but you just hook the trigger on
there<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:47.039> hand<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> be

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
there and your hand is going to be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.939 
there and your hand is going to be
almost<00:00:48.179> closed<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> ball<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:49.859> you

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
almost closed in a ball so that when you

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.229 
almost closed in a ball so that when you
pull<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.339> bow<00:00:50.489> back<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.089> some

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
pull the bow back and you put some

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.270 
pull the bow back and you put some
tension<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.839> your<00:00:52.410> fingers<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> 90

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
tension on there your fingers on a 90

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
tension on there your fingers on a 90
degree<00:00:53.519> crook<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.929> just<00:00:54.960> apply

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
degree crook and that you can just apply

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
degree crook and that you can just apply
some<00:00:55.739> pressure<00:00:55.859> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.850> squeeze

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
some pressure and then actually squeeze

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.270 
some pressure and then actually squeeze
the<00:00:57.329> rest<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> shot<00:00:57.929> off<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:59.070> back

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the rest of the shot off with back

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.489 
the rest of the shot off with back
tension<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> many<00:01:00.749> times<00:01:01.019> people<00:01:01.140> were

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
tension so many times people were

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.100 
tension so many times people were
reaching<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> trigger<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.870> they<00:01:03.870> can't

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
reaching for the trigger and they can't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.479

even reach the trigger they're reaching
all<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.810> can't

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
all the way out like this and they can't

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.000 
all the way out like this and they can't
pull<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> trigger<00:01:07.409> they're<00:01:07.740> actually

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
pull the trigger they're actually

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830 
pull the trigger they're actually
slapping<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.480> it's<00:01:09.630> real

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
slapping down on it so it's real

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500 
slapping down on it so it's real
important<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.980> of<00:01:11.040> these<00:01:11.190> risk<00:01:11.510> releases

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
important a lot of these risk releases

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
important a lot of these risk releases
this<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> true<00:01:13.409> ball<00:01:13.590> beast

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

bell of your hand not up on your wrist

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.770 
bell of your hand not up on your wrist
where<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> slides<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:23.970> consistent<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
where it slides so that's consistent and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
where it slides so that's consistent and
then<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.649> adjustments<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
then you have adjustments here so you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
then you have adjustments here so you
can<00:01:26.759> adjust<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.390> an<00:01:28.020> eighth<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> an<00:01:28.469> inch<00:01:28.560> at

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
can adjust it up an eighth of an inch at

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
can adjust it up an eighth of an inch at
a<00:01:28.770> time<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.360> custom

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a time so that you can get that custom

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.080 
a time so that you can get that custom
feel<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:31.979> too<00:01:32.250> long<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.969> many

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
feel so that it's not too long so many

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
feel so that it's not too long so many
people<00:01:33.450> set<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> where<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.170> comfortable

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
people set it to where it's comfortable

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
people set it to where it's comfortable
with<00:01:34.770> no<00:01:34.920> tension<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.399> there<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.299> when

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
with no tension on there and then when
