00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.210
 but aggressive with a spend I come mounted 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 in a good hammer a mini now dreams 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.170
 with my life and lead a hello voice 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.000
 how about you guys in this video I come to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.830
 show you a trick of infinite money 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.750
 alone with which you will not need to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.710
 nobody will be able to cover to buy you 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 all the things of the new 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.550
 update all the planes the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 helicopter and the new strollers that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.939
 everything is worth a true pasture 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.439
 The first thing that you will have to do will be 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 get the vehicle that you want 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.380
 do the trick and I recommend that you 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.019
 judge with vehicles that are not fancy 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.120
 because it always comes out with these and once 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.860
 you have already removed from the garage the vehicle 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 I in this case for example I have inside 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.050
 of this building the houses 3 and 31 this 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 I took it from the house number 3 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 with which now what I will do once 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 is already out of the garage will open a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.460
 of the missions and once you have it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 open on the little screen is blank 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.020
 I will launch myself towards the garage butt and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 just before arriving press the ax me 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.829
 it will come out that I choose which garage I want to go to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 Well, like the garage I got it from 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.539
 car not taken out of garage number 3 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.770
 sorry I put it in 31 and that step what 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.600
 we have to do very fast there are 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
 choose very very fast the garage 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.540
 contrary to what we have taken the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.250
 vehicle 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 we are already there we are waiting for you in the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.660
 black screen if we want to replace 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.150
 the vehicle 8 or 10 seconds we give to 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.410
 that if we cancel the mission and the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 cancel the mission as you have seen 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.490
 we went inside our garage 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 we put the pando and change it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.420
 any vehicle that vehicle is us 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.800
 will go to the other garage once 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.540
 we have the pando inside the only thing that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.280
 we have to do is get out of the garage and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.590
 we'll have another parked at the door what 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 we take and we put it to our garage if 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 you do not do this process and you go 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 directly to sell the car you will lose 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.400
 what you have in the garage is to say 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.380
 you have to put the two cars at 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
 garage and once you have them both 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 in the garage you take one of them and you 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.070
 you go and sell it and when you go back you go back to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.590
 do the same process and keep doing 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.270
 paste for a tube now you will see how I go 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.940
 I sell it without any problem and I return to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.979
